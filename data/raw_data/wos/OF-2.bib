Abstract = {{Factors affecting egg dimensions were investigated in two neighbouring
   Great Tit populations breeding in a poor urban and a rich rural habitat
   in southeast Estonia. About 80\% of variation in egg size was heritable;
   however, the effects of female condition were also remarkable. In both
   populations, females laying large eggs were heavier during the second
   half of the nestling period, indicating that egg size reflects the
   component of female condition which is persistent throughout the
   breeding period. In the urban population, egg size decreased seasonally,
   most likely because of a poor phenotypic quality of late breeders. In
   the rural population, large clutches tended to contain small eggs, which
   points to a trade-off between the size and number of eggs. The analysis
   of Literature data from 30 Great Tit populations revealed no evidence of
   a trade-off between egg size and clutch size at the inter-populational
   level, but rather a positive correlation between these traits among
   populations. Egg size increased with latitude.}},

Title = {{Changes in the archipelago bird populations of the Finnish quark, Gulf
   of Bothnia, from 1957-60 to 1990-91}},
Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{72}},

Pages = {{115-126}},
Abstract = {{The article presents (mostly one-visit) censuses of 114 islands in the
   Finnish Quark in 1957-60 and 1991. As a reference area we include data
   from censuses conducted at the bird sanctuary Valsorarna/Valassaaret in
   1960 and 1990. The populations of 20 well-known species almost doubled
   in 30 years; the change is fairly similar both in the 114 islands
   studied and in the reference area. The increase in numbers is largely
   attributable to the dominating species in the Finnish Quark, namely
   Sterna paradisaea (ca 2 770 pairs in the areas studied), Larus canus (ca
   2 290 pairs), and Cepphus grylle (ca 2 250 pairs). Increases have
   occurred also in low or formerly decreased populations, e.g. Alca torda,
   Anthus petrosus, and Stercorarius parasiticus. The establishment of
   Larus ridibundus even on offshore islands is reflected in the data.
   Marked population decreases are noted for Aythya marila, Charadrius
   hiaticula, Larus fuscus, Sterna caspia, and Sterna hirundo, out of which
   four species are listed as threatened in Finland. At Valsorarna, Tringa
   tetanus and Arenaria interpres have also decreased significantly, but in
   the rest of the Quark we noted a minor decrease only. Totally, we
   present population data for ca 50 species, with reservations for census
   errors in some of them. Immediate follow-up studies are suggested for
   Bjorkogrunden, a protected area where the number of archipelago birds
   decreased ca 30\%, and for the species with marked population decreases.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Pages = {{145-153}},
Abstract = {{Variation in the waterfowl community structures of wetland habitat types
   were studied in the northern part of the Finnish lake district during
   two decades (1970-1990). Mixotrophic and eutrophic lake types were
   identified on the basis of DCA ordinations of waterfowl assemblages. The
   community gradients of these lake types were distinguished also on an
   annual scale. The communities were found to be fairly stable across
   time. Total waterfowl densities fluctuated most (CV\% 13-14), and the
   number of species (CV\% 5-7) and species diversity (CV\% 1-3) the least.
   The between-year component for total diversities was only 1-2\% and the
   number of species 12-13\%. The two lake types showed different dynamics
   of species populations. CV\% of pair numbers of the three most abundant
   species were 12-29\% in mixotrophic lakes and 30-36\% in eutrophic ones.
   Gradients of community structure and long-term dynamics seem to be
   primarily connected with habitat, indicating that the lakes are in
   different phases of ecological succession.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{154-158}},
Abstract = {{The arrivals and departures of Audouin's Gulls Larus audouinii from the
   breeding colony in different commercial fishery situations were studied
   to assess changes in their daily activity pattern. Gulls arriving to the
   colony were assumed to show arrivals from the foraging grounds, while
   those departing from the colony were assumed to show departures to
   forage. The activity pattern of Audouin's Gulls in the Ebro Delta seemed
   to depend especially on trawler activity, irrespective of whether night
   fisheries occurred at the same time. Indeed, gulls seemed to fit their
   arrivals and departures to the trawler timetable. Audouin's Gull
   departures from the colony at sunset were always recorded, those being
   most intense when only night fishing occurred and slightly lower when no
   fishing vessels were working in the area. These departures were probably
   related to nocturnal foraging activity, and suggested that this
   nocturnal activity occurred under any fishing fleet activity situation.
   When trawlers did not operate. diurnal activity wan also recorded
   probably associated with foraging trips to rice fields. Any changes in
   fishery activity, such as the trawler moratorium established in 1991
   during the breeding season of Audouin's Gull may affect the feeding
   ecology of the species and its conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Data on haematozoan parasitemias in Laridae are scarce and, since blood
   parasites may influence birds fitness, it is important to report their
   incidence in threatened species such as Audouin's Gull. Blood smears of
   90 Audouin's Gulls caught during incubation at their two main breeding
   sites, the Ebro Delta and the Chafarinas Islands, were examined for
   Haemoproteus lari parasitemia. Overall prevalence of the parasite was
   92.1\% for the Chafarinas Is. and 28.9\% for the Ebro Delta. To our
   knowledge, prevalences reported in this study are the highest ever
   recorded for Laridae. Differences in prevalence between localities were
   significant, but not differences between the sexes within each locality.
   Males were more intensely parasitized than females in Chafarinas, and
   gulls from Chafarinas were more intensely parasitized than those from
   the Ebro Delta. Differences in intensity were also checked using data
   from sympatric Yellow-legged Gulls, L. cachinnans, and only the factor
   locality was significant. There was no significant relationship between
   body condition and intensity of parasitemia in males or females in
   either locality. These data indicate higher susceptibility to H. lari
   for gulls breeding at the Chafarinas Islands.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) reflects the ability of animals to cope with
   environmental and genetic stress. Studies made so far have not yet
   focused and discussed FA's possible effects on migrating birds. In
   migrating passerines, FA may reflect an individual's overall condition
   and dominance during the moulting and pre-migratory period. We studied
   how FA correlates with the timing of migration in one common migratory
   species, the Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus L.). In our study,
   adult females that migrated earlier have more asymmetrical outermost
   tail feathers than those migrating later. In males, there was no
   significant correlation between FA and timing of migration. Adult
   females moult later than males and thus may suffer from time constraints
   in their moult before migration. Competition for food resources in
   contemporary migrating females may explain why more asymmetrical,
   probably low quality females, may have to migrate first.}},

Title = {{REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE OF THE NOMINATE LESSER BLACK-BACKED GULL UNDER
   THE PRESSURE OF HERRING GULL PREDATION}},
Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Predation by Herring Gulls Larus argentatus was one of the major causes
   of death among Lesser Black-back chicks Larus f. fuscus during a 14-year
   study period in the Gulf of Finland. Prior to culling operations, 17\%
   of chick deaths were attributed to predation by neighbouring Herring
   Gulls in the study colony (chicks' rings were found in predators' food
   remnants). Culling these proven predators (2 pairs) lowered the
   predation rate to 2\% and improved the fledging result significantly.
   However, predatory gulls from adjacent colonies, operating also in the
   study colony, were harder to track and remove. This `'long-distance''
   predation still continued to operate even though the numbers of occupied
   Herring Gull nests in the entire Soderskar archipelago were reduced by
   40\% in four years (by egg culling). Hence, random culling is not an
   effective solution in cases when selective removal of every specialized
   predator is not possible. This report does not, however, aim to asses
   the ethical grounds and the legitimacy of culling programs. Despite
   being a relatively large gull with a relatively large territory size,
   the nominate race of the Lesser Black-backed Gull shows behavioural
   analogies to the smaller, inoffensive gulls. It shows no intraspecific
   predation, and lacks effective defence against interspecific predation
   by larger gulls. Therefore the nominate fuscus seems to be especially
   vulnerable to Herring Gull predation. At present, the predation has an
   adverse effect on the reproduction of the nominate fuscus as it applies
   predominantly to the best-growing chicks, the potential recruits of the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of loud vocalizations by female Great Snipe Gallinago
   media is reported for the first time. Such female loud calls were easily
   distinguished in the field from the male vocalizations. The female
   behaviour associated with the vocalizations resembled male display
   postures. Sonagrams show a structural resemblance with part of the male
   display call. The female loud call consisted of short notes with a large
   frequency spectrum repeated 18-27 times in 1 to 1.5 seconds. In 1992 a
   total of 96 female loud calls were heard at three leks in central
   Norway, including 63 at a single lek. Loud calls were heard from 22 May
   to 7 June, and the median date was 25 May. Loud calls occurred
   throughout the night from 23.20 to 02.51 h, with a peak around 02.00 h
   (summertime). Loud female vocalization seems to be a regularly occurring
   behaviour pattern for Great Snipe. Other female vocalizations heard on

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Abstract = {{Copulation behaviour and mate guarding among radio-tagged male
   Chaffinches were studied in conifer-dominated forest in southern Finland
   in 1990-1991. Pair copulation rate was highest (one copulation hour-1)
   about 1 to 3 days before egg laying and thereafter decreased.
   Neighbouring males attempted to obtain extra-pair copulations during the
   presumed fertile period of the female. Both intra-pair copulations and
   EPC-attempts were observed throughout all daylight hours. Males guarded
   their mates by close following and guarding was most intensive in the
   population of high breeding density. Mate guarding began several days
   before egg laying and continued until the start of incubation in high
   density population but not in the low density. As eggs are fertilized
   during a short insemination window after laying and sperm transferred
   just after laying most probably fertilizes the following egg, males
   would be expected to ensure paternity by copulating both with their own
   mates and other females during this time. However, male Chaffinches do
   not seem to recognise the insemination window, as there were no diurnal
   differences in intra-pair copulations or mate guarding intensity either
   prior to or during the days when eggs were fertilized. Another
   explanation is that they have to spread out their copulations to
   decrease the risk of cuckoldry. Intensive mate guarding until the start
   of incubation seems to be important due to continuous threat of
   EPC-seeking males especially in high breeding density. This may be most
   likely in coniferous habitat where extra-pair males are able to
   inconspicuously approach females and guarding males may easily lose
   contact with their mates.}},

Abstract = {{The parameters of ecological energetics were measured using three groups
   of Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus: caged, enclosured and free-living
   birds. This comparison makes it possible to evaluate the usability of
   caged birds for studies on ecological energetics. Determining daily
   energy budget (DEB) in free-living birds bases on the quantity of
   excrements left in the snow burrow, estimation of the digestibility
   coefficients of food stuffs and time budgets of individual birds.
   Studies on free-living birds revealed the strong influence of diet on
   energetics. Gross energy intake (GEI) in males was around twice that of
   enclosured birds, while digestion coefficient was clearly lower. DEB of
   free-living birds was very close the DEB in the enclosure. Using body
   weight correction the difference was only 5 \%. DEB values of males
   expressed as multiples of basal metabolic rate were in cages 1.4, in the
   enclosure 1.8 and in the field 1.8. This paper describes the techniques
   used in Russian studies on winter energetics of grouse, and it gives
   some examples of the application of the method. This example also
   confirms the usefulness of birds in captivity for studies on ecological
   energetics.}},

   broods where all hatchlings fledged. Phenotypic variation in size was
   also remarkable among breeders. Cohorts of adults, born in poor breeding
   years had shorter tarsi than those born in normal years. Small females
   tended to lay small clutches which is consistent with the hypothesis
   that poor nestling history may have a lasting effect on the condition of
   breeding females and affect clutch size. I could not establish
   significant differences between populations in any of the aspects

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Herrera (1978) found an inverse relationship between relative densities
   of resident and migrant passerines in European breeding bird
   assemblages. He hypothesized that the decreasing proportion of migrants
   to the south would be due to interspecific competition with residents.
   The putative competition between resident titmice (Parus montanus and P.
   major) and migrant conguilders (Fringilla coelebs and Phylloscopus
   trochilus) was tested by a playback experiment in northern Finland. If
   competition was important between individual birds, it could reduce
   overlap between territories. The spatial configuration of the two
   migrant species was studied in relation to the nests of the two
   residents during the breeding season in late May - early June, in 1989
   and 1990. The experiment was carried out at 13 (year 1989) and 17 (year
   1990) tit-nest plots. To control habitat effects, the tape was also
   played at control plots where the tit pair had bred in the previous year
   and at randomly chosen plots. The data were analysed using log-linear
   models, which test for dependencies between categorical variables. In
   1990, there were far fewer positive responses at the study points than
   in 1989, possibly due to changes in the population densities of the
   migrants. We found that migrants did not avoid settlement near or in
   resident territories. There was a tendency that migrants aggregated more
   at the vicinity of tit-nests compared with the random- and control
   plots. This result is consistent with the `heterospecific attraction'
   hypothesis generated by Monkkonen et al. (1990).}},

Abstract = {{Counting the adult birds at breeding colonies is the only useful method

   Diurnal and seasonal rhythms of colony attendance were studied during
   three summers at Valassaaret, Gulf of Bothnia. The attendance always
   peaked in the early morning, soon after sunrise, and then declined
   sharply. Early morning counts should thus be preferred for monitoring,
   but counts conducted at other times of day can be transformed by use of
   correction factors to estimate the peak numbers. Counts made directly
   from the breeding islands are to be recommended in preference to
   undisturbed counts from a distance. Similar diurnal attendance patterns
   have been found in most study areas in Europe; in seasonal rhythm there
   seems to be more local variation. The biological significance of the
   pronounced early diurnal attendance peak at Black Guillemot colonies is
   discussed briefly.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Pages = {{81-94}},
Abstract = {{The adaptive response of Finnish birds to the limits imposed by species
   dynamics, biological constraints, and environment is described by
   examining the patterns and underlying mechanisms in the relationships
   between the number of species, body size, population density, and
   geographical range size.  In the total breeding avifauna the frequency
   distribution of species with respect to body size was bimodal, while
   various subsets of species showed unimodal distributions significantly
   skewed toward the larger body size categories.  Abundance distributions
   of larger sets of species usually followed the canonical lognormal
   distribution with no significant skewness, while minor groups in general
   were not normally distributed and exhibited significant left-skewness. 
   The variances of abundance were somewhat higher than the variances of
   biomass, suggesting that biomass and energy use were more equitably
   distributed among species than indicated by their abundance.  Relatively
   more large than small species winter in Finland.  So, from the energetic
   point of view, the differences between the summer and winter bird
   communities were not as great as suggested on the basis of the number of
   individuals.  The average density of birds decreased significantly with
   increasing body size, but the slope of the relationship was shallower
   (-0.52) than expected for the energetic equivalence of the species.  The
   Finnish range size of species tended to decrease with increasing body
   size, partly because the ranges of many larger species have been reduced
   by human impact.  The width of the range increased with density in the
   total set of species as well as in most of the ecological groups
   considered, indicating the progress and success of colonization.}},

   Laying schedule and laying order were examined, and hatching and

   drop in the temperature.  The Redstart, unlike the Pied Flycatcher, did
   not respond to the exceptionally low temperatures during the time of

   the number of Atlas-squares with Wood Larks declined by 29\% in
   Turku-Pori, and by 67\% in the whole of Finland. We estimate the size of
   the Wood Lark population in SW-Finland to be about 400 pairs. We could
   not confirm the steady decline from the 1940s, which has been reported
   based on migration counts, probably because observer density and
   behaviour have changed concurrently. By an analysis of habitat
   characteristics we show that Wood Larks select their breeding sites
   carefully. Wood Lark territories were larger and more open than nearby
   control plots. The number and height of trees, and proportion of
   deciduous trees also differed between territories and control plots.
   Based on the same analysis, we estimate that 10-35\% of the suitable
   sites of the rocky habitat type were vacant in the beginning of the
   1990s.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{We studied breeding and natal site fidelity of Willow Warblers
   Phylloscopus trochilus in 1983 to 1993 at two ringing sites, Ammarnas in
   Swedish Lapland and Kvismaren in South Central Sweden. The yearly
   trapping effort was rather similar at the two study sites. We used
   pooled data from all study years in the analyses. The overall recapture
   rate was almost two times higher at Kvismaren than at Ammarnas. This
   difference was caused by an eight times higher recapture rate of Willow
   Warblers ringed as juveniles at Kvismaren as compared to Ammarnas,
   whereas the recapture rate of birds ringed as adults did not differ
   between study sites. When we restrict the analysis to include mainly
   local birds, the between year recapture rate of juveniles was still more
   than 20 times higher at Kvismaren than at Ammarnas. We discuss two
   possible explanations for this difference in recapture rate of juveniles
   between the two study sites. One explanation is that juvenile Willow
   Warblers at Ammarnas may suffer higher mortality, either because they
   have a longer migration route or as a result of adverse weather
   conditions in the breeding areas in late summer. This is, however,
   contradicted by the fact that the breeding densities of Willow Warblers
   in the mountain birch forest are much higher than in other habitats
   where the subspecies (P.t. acredula) occurs in Sweden. Thus a more
   likely explanation is that natal site fidelity is lower at Ammarnas,
   possibly as a result of a homogeneous habitat (mountain birch forest)
   and because rich food patches (e.g. Epirrita autumnata) are
   unpredictably distributed between years.}},

   Great Spotted Woodpeckers was studied in the Wielkopolski National Park,

   Aggressive behaviour was observed only rarely. During both winters the
   exclusive male and female territories probably did not exist, or were
   very small and close to one another. Both sexes fed mainly on pine cones
   and microhabitat utilization and foraging behaviour patterns were
   generally similar. However, significant differences were found in almost
   all aspects of male and female feeding niches. Males, more than females
   foraged on cones and their foraging behaviour was more stereotyped.
   Females used a greater spectrum of microhabitats and techniques, and
   were more mobile than males. This was probably a consequence of male
   social dominance, which influenced the females to feed more often on
   alternative food. These differences are thought to be a result of less
   defined territories due to a temporarily richer food supply.}},

Abstract = {{The size of the clutch declines with the date of laying of the first egg
   in many, but not all waterfowl (Anatidae). This paper reviews the
   published data on rates of decline in clutch size of waterfowl during
   the breeding season to: (i) determine whether the decline rates were
   related to the length of the breeding season at the nesting site, and/or
   to whether the birds were nesting in captivity or in the wild and; (ii)
   to propose tests of the reasons that have been suggested previously to
   account for these seasonal declines in clutch size. Rates of decline
   were greater at higher latitudes (50-degrees) (where breeding seasons
   are relatively short) than at middle latitudes (30-degrees - 49-degrees)
   (where breeding seasons are longer). The majority of waterfowl that
   exhibited no or low rates of decline nested at middle latitudes, or in
   captivity. These findings are consistent with the three main factors
   (seasonally declining nutrient reserves, physiological effects of
   diminishing daylength, seasonally diminishing chances of survival) that
   have been proposed as causes of intra-seasonal declines in clutch size
   of waterfowl. Feeding studies, relocation studies, and experiments in
   which light regimes are manipulated, are required to distinguish between
   these three possible causes of falling clutch size with laving date in
   waterfowl.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-16}},
Abstract = {{We studied nest-site and post-nesting feeding site fidelity in a
   population of Common Eiders Somateria mollissima in North Norway during
   five consecutive breeding seasons (1986-90). Twenty-five per cent of the
   females that nested successfully and none of the unsuccessful females
   returned to the same nest. Whether females nested at the same site was
   independent of nesting variables other than total clutch loss.
   Similarly, nest-site fidelity did not result in nesting variables
   different from those of females which changed their nest-site. In
   contrast, fidelity to post-nesting feeding sites was very high (92\%).
   Females that showed post-nesting feeding site fidelity did not have a
   higher rate of nest-site fidelity than than other birds in the
   population. We therefore contend that in Common Eiders fidelity to a
   specific nest-site is less important than fidelity to the post-nesting
   feeding site. Going to areas where the female knows that sufficient food
   can be found is very important for both the female and her brood. In
   comparison to other duck species with more specific nest-site
   requirements (cavity-nesting ducks), Common Eiders have a low return
   rate to previous nest-sites, and we suggest that this reflects a
   difference in the availability of suitable sites.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of food for breeding Curlews Numenius arquata and their
   foraging success were studied in different farmland habitats at a study
   site in central Sweden in the years 1987-199 1. Earthworms were found to
   be the most important food organisms during the pre-breeding period,
   when a significantly higher number of earthworms were caught per minute
   in sown grassland than in tillage. The biomass of earthworms did not
   differ between these habitats, so the greater availability of earthworms
   in sown grass was probably due to their intact burrow systems, which
   made them easier to catch than in tillage, where their burrow systems
   were destroyed each year during cultivation. Surface-living
   invertebrates played a minor role as food items during the pre-breeding
   period, especially in terms of biomass. Significantly fewer earthworms
   were caught in the breeding period than in the pre-breeding period. In
   the breeding period the shorter-billed males caught significantly more
   surface-living invertebrates than the longer-billed females in tillage
   and meadow, whereas the longer-billed females were able to catch more
   earthworms than the males. The availability of surface-living
   invertebrates to Curlews was probably affected by both invertebrate
   density and vegetation structure. A large number of surface-living
   invertebrates were caught per minute in tillage, where their biomass was
   relatively low and the vegetation sparse. In sown grass (with relatively
   high and dense vegetation), the biomass of invertebrates was high, but
   the number caught by Curlews per minute low, despite many foraging pecks
   and probes. The greater availability (not larger biomass) of food items
   in grasslands and flooded tillage than in dry tillage early in the
   season is probably a factor responsible for the higher densities of
   Curlews in these habitats than in modem farmland, where dry tillage
   predominates.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of an individually marked Chaffinch Fringilla
   coelebs population was studied in coniferous forest in Lammi, in

   predation, calculated from the nests found during the building stage,

   Nest height or nest-tree species in the nest-card data had no effect on
   nest survival.
   Nest predation seems to be a major factor affecting breeding success and
   probably lifetime reproductive success in the Chaffinch. It seems that
   the nest predation in this species is a probabilistic process which the
   parent birds are hardly able to influence. We discuss the implications
   of the high nest predation rate for the breeding behaviour of the
   Chaffinch.}},

   - A BIOGEOGRAPHICAL COMPARISON}},
Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{71-77}},
Abstract = {{Cities represent the extreme of human-modified environments, with only
   remnants of the original habitats present. To study how increasing
   urbanization affects breeding bird richness; we compiled literature data
   on bird assemblages at five different levels of urbanization (forest,
   countryside, village, small and large city centers) and along an urban
   gradient (park, residential area and city center in different towns) in
   the three ornithogeographical zones in Finland. The breeding birds were
   censused using the territory mapping or study plot method. The estimated
   number of breeding bird species decreased with urbanization. The highest
   species richness was found in the countryside (21.8 species in a 50-pair
   sample) and the lowest in the large city center (7.4 spp.). This finding
   supports the widely accepted hypothesis that moderate disturbance will
   increase biotic diversity. The estimated number of breeding bird species
   was lower in the city centers (6.8 species in a 25-pair sample) than in
   the urban parks (12.1 spp.).  This result points to the important role
   of trees and shrubs as shelter, and as nesting and feeding places.  The
   species richness was similar at different latitudes, when the level of
   urbanization was the same. The great productivity (amount of food) and
   high predictability of resources (food available throughout the year) in
   the urban habitats may explain why the species richness does not
   decrease northwards in the urban environments.}},

   DISAPPEARANCE OF SNOW COVER IN TENGMALMS OWL AEGOLIUS-FUNEREUS}},
Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{78-88}},
Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that the snow-dependent diet switch in Tengmalm's
   Owl Aegolius funereus is caused by a simultaneous habitat shift, we
   studied seasonal changes in prey availability and the selection of major
   prey and habitat types by two radio-equipped nesting males. When the
   ground was completely snow-covered, bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus
   were die commonest prey, and the owls hunted more in forest than could
   be expected from random use. When snow-free ground appeared, the owls
   switched their prey and habitat; field voles Microtus agrestis and root
   voles M. oeconomus became the commonest prey, and clear-cuts and forest
   were used in proportion to availability. Snap-trapping showed that bank
   voles were commoner in forest than in clear-cuts, while field and root
   voles occurred almost only in clear-cuts. Snow-tracking showed that long
   small mammal trails (>1 m) were commonest in forest, short trails (<1 m)
   were equally common in the two habitat types, and ventilation holes were
   commonest in clear-cuts.  Thus, prey animals occurring above the snow
   were probably more available to the owls in forest than in clear-cuts.
   When the snow melted, prey availability therefore increased in
   clear-cuts relative to that in forest. Thus, the owls seemed to select
   their microtine prey indirectly by selecting the habitat according to
   gain. Although the ratio of field and root voles to bank voles in the
   prey delivered to the nests increased as the ratio of clear-cut to
   forest increased among the habitats used by the hunting owls, field and
   root voles were consistently delivered more than could be expected from
   the owls' habitat use. The most likely reason is that these voles move
   slower than bank voles and are more easily taken by the owls once
   encountered.}},

Pages = {{89-95}},
Abstract = {{The effect of breeding status and sex on time allocation in Canada Geese
   Branta canadensis during the breeding season was studied in 1988 in
   central Sweden. Time budgets were established during four parts of the
   breeding season: on the breeding grounds before egg-laying, during
   incubation, when the goslings were newly hatched and when the goslings
   were fledged or nearly fledged. Most differences in time allocation
   between categories and sexes were due to differences in energetically
   costly processes and in the demands of other types of behaviour than
   foraging, mainly vigilance. Prior to nesting, there were indications
   that the use of reserves could be important, at least for breeding
   females. The allocation of time to foraging prior to and during the
   moult by non-breeding geese suggested that during the moult they relied
   on energy reserves gained in the preceding period. Vigilance was the
   most common behaviour for breeding geese after the goslings had hatched.
   During the early brood-rearing period, breeding females showed a weak
   tendency to be less vigilant and spend more time for-aging than breeding
   males, though these differences were not statistically significant. When
   the goslings were fledged or nearly fledged, the time allocation of
   breeding females and males was almost identical. The proportion of time
   spent on vigilance by geese with goslings was not significantly
   correlated with the brood size.}},

   specialists. Dispersion of traditional nesting places had a major effect

Abstract = {{Density of the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius was examined and
   reproductive data collected, both in a forest landscape area (128 km2)
   and in a farmland area (123 km2) with highly fragmented forests (26\%
   forest), in central Sweden during 1985-1990. The composition, age, and
   the management practices of the forests did not differ in the two areas.
   We found that the densities (about 0.15 territorial pairs/km2 of forest
   land) were the same in the forest area and in the farmland area with
   highly fragmented forests. Furthermore, we found no differences in the
   reproductive rate, predation rate, body conditions of the young, or the
   breeding times between the two areas. The frequency distribution based
   on the duration in years of the territory occupation was also the same
   in both areas. We conclude that the Black Woodpecker is not excluded
   from highly fragmented forests.and can successfully breed there,
   provided that tree composition and food supplies are suitable. However,
   we do not know what the lower limit of fragmentation is for the species.
   Further studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation on the Black
   Woodpecker are needed from northern Fennoscandia, where the density is
   lower than in southern Sweden.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{163-167}},
Abstract = {{Experiments in the nest site choice of breeding birds in relation to the
   distance from habitat edge are missing or few. We performed such an
   experiment with the aid of nest-box -breeding Common Treecreepers
   Certhia familiaris. In their first choice of the breeding site,
   Treecreepers clearly favoured the boxes further away from the forest
   edge. In consequence, the number of successful breeding attempts was
   higher for the nests further away from the edge.  There are two possible
   hypotheses to explain the results. First, the central place foraging
   theory predicts that a circular foraging range is optimal. The home
   range size of a breeding treecreeper pair is, on average, 3.3 ha,
   therefore, the nest of this species should be located at least 102 m
   from the forest edge in order to maintain a 3.3 ha circular foraging
   area. The results agree with this expectation, because in the first
   choice of nesting sites 65 per cent of the nests were further than 100 m
   from the edge. Secondly, nest predation often considerably reduces the
   breeding success of small passerine birds nesting nearby the forest
   edge. Treecreepers suffer high nest predation pressure, in particular
   when breeding in natural nest sites. If predation pressure is higher
   near the edge that may also contribute to the choice of a nest site
   further away from the forest edge.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term variability patterns among forest breeding bird assemblages
   were analysed on the basis of annually repeated mapping censuses
   conducted during 1985-1989 in several study plots in the Valdai Uplands,

   variability in breeding numbers has been strongly limited by any
   mechanisms operating in the breeding grounds. Only in the Wood Warbler,
   in a birch-dominated forest, did the number of territories vary less
   than could be explained by chance. When the data from a variety of
   forest habitats were pooled and analysed together, a prevalence of
   parallel density fluctuations among species was found. However, there
   were considerable interhabitat differences in fluctuation patterns. At
   the habitat level, the highest variability of total bird numbers, and
   the significant preponderance of parallel density fluctuations among
   species were found in the richest assemblage with the highest number of
   congeneric species (grey alder forest). Even secondary hole-nesters gave
   no indications of compensatory density fluctuations. There was little
   evidence of competitive density interactions at the assemblage level.
   Individualistic responses of species to environment, stochastic
   processes, predation pressure on the key species, and heterospecific
   attraction seem to be more important in determining bird assemblage
   variability and creating interhabitat differences in fluctuation

   size-dimorphic birds of prey in the Holarctic region with females larger
   than males. The contribution of female size to egg size and clutch
   volume (number of eggs x mean egg volume of a clutch) was studied in
   western Finland during 1981-1990, when the abundance of the owls' main
   food (voles) fluctuated in 3-yr cycles. Clutch volume was positively
   related to female body-weight, independent of laying date, which
   significantly affected egg size in good vole years. Female age, male
   age, and territory quality did not affect clutch volume. Clutch volume
   was not associated with female wing-length, but in the peak phase of the
   vole cycle, long-winged and heavy females produced significantly larger
   eggs than did short-winged and light females. The results indicate that
   females can benefit from large skeletal size only in years of food
   abundance, and that the nutritional condition of females was essential
   to reproductive success. Our results also suggest that the largeness of

Abstract = {{We studied the number and the breeding ecology of Rooks in the
   surroundings of Oulu, northern Finland (65-degrees-N, 25-degrees 30'E)
   during 1987-1992. The number of breeding pairs was about 500 in 10
   colonies. Non-breeding birds formed 15-35\% of the population. Breeding
   started in mid April. Average clutch size (3.7) was only slightly
   smaller but the mean number of young produced (1.6 in successful
   nestings and 1.1 in all nests) was considerably smaller than in Middle
   Europe. The most productive clutch size varied between 4 and 6 annually.
   Early breeders had larger clutches and produced slightly more young than
   late breeders. Nest site did not affect breeding success; however, Rooks
   breeding in the top sites of multiple nested trees bred earlier and had
   larger clutches than others. Normally, repeat nesting was rare. Annual
   variation was very high, both in clutch and brood sizes. Mean May
   temperature and duration of ground frost appeared to predict rather well
   the forthcoming breeding success. Low success in cold springs may
   reflect reduced availability of earthworms (main food for the nestlings)
   due to the prolonged ground frost period. Nowadays, the Oulu population
   is at its largest, and has doubled during the last two decades. It seems
   that this increase can not be explained by the local reproduction, but
   has more obviously been based on immigration from the south and/or east.
   More information, especially ringing records, is needed to confirm this.}},

   in the Willow Tit Parus montanus were compared in an attempt to
   elucidate the still poorly understood connection between hormones and

   runs parallel to seasonal variations in the plasma levels of
   testosterone, showing peaks in both spring and late summer.  In females,
   increased testosterone levels could be established only in late summer,
   but, as in the males, the increased levels in late summer are due
   exclusively to juvenile birds.  In view of the idea that song production
   in birds is closely associated with testosterone, these findings confirm
   the conclusions that most of the singing in spring is done by adult
   Willow Tit males, that the chief contributors to the song period in late
   summer are the juveniles of either sex, and that the singing of immature
   Willow Tits occurs mainly in connection with aggressive encounters.  The

   the Common Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) between special nest-boxes
   (southern Finland; 61-degrees-N) and natural nesting sites (Lithuania

   laying date or the frequency of the second clutches. Significant
   differences were found in clutch size, number of fledglings per breeding
   attempt and frequency of the replacement clutches. The reproductive rate
   was lower in natural sites than in nest-boxes, because of the higher
   nest predation in natural cavities (37\% vs. 8\% in nest-boxes). The
   higher predation in natural cavities led to greater frequency of
   replacement clutches in natural holes. This increased the clutch size,
   because the Treecreeper lays the largest clutches in the middle of its
   breeding period. The proportion of nests suffering predation did not

   plot.  Furthermore, productivity of the forest area near the nest site
   played only a minor role in the nest-box selection of the Pied
   Flycatcher.  The results for the individual years indicated either a
   random or a regular pattern of nest distribution.  The Stouffer combined
   test supported regularity.  This result stresses the importance of
   intraspecific territoriality even in the far north where bird
   populations are relatively sparse.  Regularity of spatial pattern was
   especially pronounced in high-density years.}},

Abstract = {{The number of Common Cranes (Grus grus) wintering in the main wintering
   grounds in SW France increased from 25 in 1977 (first observation year)
   to 2500 in 1988. The annual variation observed around this general
   tendency can mainly be explained by autumn rainfall, which causes early
   flooding of the marshland used by the cranes. The night roosts are
   located in water basins and low heaths. During the day, the cranes
   prefer the low heaths, where they feed intensively. Five micro-habitats,
   defining an after-fire succession, are described in the low heaths. The
   regrowth of the vegetation after fires caused by military activities is
   rapid and the cranes seek out zones undergoing recolonization. The
   management of the heaths by fire seems to favour the cranes.}},

Abstract = {{In the greater part of Finland, the rain call of the male Chaffinch is
   huitt, but in the south of the vast SW archipelago of Finland ``huitt,
   but in the south replaced by ``rrup{''}.  When c. 80 km of the boundary
   between these call dialects were mapped, little overlap was found,
   usually at most a few km.  At one site there was a bulge of ``huitt{''}
   males into the area of the ``rrup{''} males.  Individuals using the one
   dialect were only exceptionally heard so deep in the area of the other
   as to be out of hearing distance of the users of their own dialect.  In
   an area c. 20 km NE of the continuous range of the ``rrup{''} dialect,
   19 ``rrup{''} males were recorded during a period of 55 years.  They
   were heard for a few days, but as they were not ringed, it was
   impossible to decide whether they had stayed and relearnt the call from
   the surrounding males, or were floaters.  ``Rrup{''} males were also
   occasionally recorded in other parts of the ``huitt{''} area in Finland.
   In part of Karelia and the Leningrad district, a ``rrup{''} type dialect
   has long been known to prevail, though detailed information on its
   boundaries is not available.  Factors possibly influencing the
   development of the archipelago dialect are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The territorial behaviour of male Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs was
   studied by radio tracking in coniferous forest in southern Finland.  In
   total 24 males were tracked in 1988-90.  The local Chaffinch population
   consisted of birds of different breeding status:  most of the males were
   paired and started to breed, but some of them remained unpaired for the
   whole breeding season or remained unpaired after the disappearance of
   their mates.  Nest predation increased asynchrony in breeding.  The
   reaction to nest predation and the behaviour after successful fledging
   differed among both males and females.  After fledging some males fed
   their young, whereas others did not participate in feeding but started
   to sing intensively.  Some females made a new attempt at nesting whereas
   others disappeared, leaving their mates alone.  The activities of the
   male Chaffinches were not restricted to the singing territory:  all
   males made extra-territorial trips in every breeding stage.  These trips
   were made for foraging or inconspicuously to the territories of other
   males, apparently in search of extra-pair copulations.  Because of the
   asynchrony in the nesting cycles of different pairs, the local
   population included fertile females throughout the season, which
   increased the opportunities to pursue a mixed reproductive strategy.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{82-87}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring of two breeding colonies in 1983-1991 indicated that both
   Herring Gulls and Common Gulls altered their migration schedule and time
   of breeding in very early springs (1989 to 1991). The date of the ice
   break-up dates varied during the study period, the maximum difference
   between dates being 96 days. There was a trend towards an earlier
   break-up in 1983-1991, and the break-up dates correlated with the
   maximum ice-cover in the Baltic, reflecting the general severity of the
   winter. The Herring Gulls occupied the breeding colony up to 54 days
   earlier in the earliest spring (1990) than in late springs, the Common
   Gulls 26 days earlier. Early arrival was followed by early breeding. The
   maximum difference between years in the initiation of the first nest was
   23 days in the Herring Gull and 11 days in the Common Gull. The response
   to a warm year is more pronounced with regard to the timing of migration
   and colony occupancy, than with regard to the timing of laying. As only
   one group of breeding birds was monitored for each species, the data
   suggest that individual adults are able to alter their migration
   behaviour from year to year. The Herring Gulls were behaviourally more
   plastic than the Common Gulls. This may be due to the wintering
   strategy; Herring Gulls stay chiefly within the Baltic and are probably
   able to monitor the meteorological conditions more readily than Common
   Gulls which migrate outside the Baltic area.}},

Abstract = {{In the springs of 1985 to 1988, amateur ornithologists searched for
   Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers in 152 census areas in the south and central
   parts of Sweden. Each census area was 200 ha. The frequency of
   occurrence of the woodpecker increased with the total area of deciduous
   woodland; when the census areas contained less than 17 ha, it was 24\%,
   when the areas had 17-38 ha it was 62\%, and with >38 ha deciduous
   woodland it was 80\%. The latitude in south and central Sweden had no
   significant effect on the area requirement, but our results show that
   the species requires larger areas in managed than in natural forests. A
   stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that the occupation of census
   areas by the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker could be predicted with 68\%
   accuracy from the area of nemoral and riparian deciduous woods (positive
   association with occupation) and the area of mixed coniferous/deciduous
   wood (negative association with occupation). Non-nemoral deciduous wood,
   marsh wood, stand age and the density of snags did not enter the
   discriminant function. The area of nemoral deciduous forest has
   decreased in Sweden during the second half of this century due to
   cutting. This is probably one cause of the decline of the Lesser Spotted
   Woodpecker.}},

   Dendrocopos minor in deciduous stands relative to forest type, snag

   species using log-linear modelling, with the area of the stands as a
   covariate.
   We found that the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker preferred stands with many
   snags (P = 0.0004) and old stands (P = 0.011), while it avoided stands
   without snags (P = 0.0011) and with mixed coniferous / deciduous forest
   (P = 0.00004). Whether the area of the stand was less than or greater
   than the median size was less important (P almost-equal-to 1). The
   preferences were the same in all the different regions studied (P
   almost-equal-to 1).
   We regard snag density, stand age and forest type as good indicators of
   the habitat preferences of the the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. Since
   these variables are easily measured in the field, they may serve as a
   starting-point for preservation of the habitats of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The body structure of nestling Feral Pigeons does not develop uniformly

   lower increments in the growth of body mass with respect to the skeletal
   index than the nestlings from broods of one. The growth of the pigeons
   was most effective during the second and third nesting attempts, which
   was best explained by the environmental conditions. The allometric
   analysis performed for body weights or wing lengths showed the
   progressive minimization of hatching asynchrony between siblings during
   development. In first hatched chicks the growth increments of
   tarsometatarsus length tended to be greater than in second hatchlings
   with the same level of skeletal index. The results for tarsometatarsus
   length confirm that tarsometatarsus size was affected and probably

Abstract = {{I studied the life history consequences of tropical migration in
   passerine birds from Europe, and eastern and western North America.
   Tropical migrants were compared with more sedentary birds within a
   region. Analyses were conducted at two different taxonomic levels.
   First, at the generic level, I investigated whether there was any
   difference between migratory habit groups in general. If a genus
   consisted of species with different migratory habits, these were treated
   separately. Second, analysis at the within-family level (between-family
   differences eliminated) was used to assess the role of phylogeny in
   relation to life history differences observed at the generic level. I
   also examined the effect of body weight on life history features, using
   regression.
   Features common to tropical migrants on both continents were lower body
   weight and a smaller number of broods than in more sedentary birds. For
   a given body weight, tropical migrants also laid smaller clutches than
   more sedentary birds, but this difference was accounted for by
   between-family differences and did not indicate a linkage with migration
   per se. Mean annual survivorship did not differ between tropical
   migrants and more sedentary birds in Europe, whereas eastern Nearctic
   tropical migrants had a significantly higher survival rate at the
   within-family level, which may therefore be a direct consequence of
   wintering in the tropics. In the Nearctics, migratory habit seemed to be
   a more important factor, affecting other life history features than in
   Europe, where body weight explained between-genera differences better.
   The implications of the between-continent differences for conservation
   are briefly discussed.}},

   same was true for C.flammea and F. montifringilla. Especially in the
   alpine heath the populations of the most common species fluctuated in
   parallel annually. Species of similar migration strategy (e.g. the

   patterns, though ground-nesting species did fluctuate in parallel, the

Abstract = {{The winter activity patterns of wild, mostly artificially fed Black

   temperature, but not with photoperiod. In December-February, the
   activity peaked in the morning, even when snow roosting was not
   possible. In late March and April, when the snow cover was hard, the

   differences between the Finnish, German and Hungarian populations were
   clear, the Hungarian population being intermediate between the other
   two.  The less marked geographical differences in the Willow Warbler
   morphology are assumed to be connected with the similarity of its
   habitats and migratory habits in Finland and Germany.  Finnish
   Chiffchaffs, breeding in spruce forest, did not seem to have special
   morphological adaptations to this habitat.  The morphological difference
   between the Willow Warbler and Chiffchaff was greater in Germany than in
   Finland.  The geographical variation of the Willow Warbler is so slight
   that the appropriateness of the currently recognised subspecies may be
   questioned.  In the Chiffchaff the variation is more extensive and
   recognition of subspecies has more justification.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Decreased intensity of interspecific competition may be expected to lead
   to increased variation within the population, especially in the form of
   sexual dimorphism.  As the Common Treecreeper is the only species
   belonging to the so-called trunk-foraging guild in the coniferous study
   area in Central Finland, apart from the more strongly billed
   woodpeckers, its foraging behaviour and/or sites could be expected to
   differ between the sexes.  Moreover, the sexual dimorphism in this
   species is considerable.
   About 99\% of the food items used by the Common Treecreepers were
   arthropods.  Aphids were the most frequent, but spiders were most
   important by weight (65\%).  This pattern did not change with the
   nestling age.  Taxonomically the nestling food was diverse.
   The average food load contained 14.2 items (24.2 mg) and did not differ
   between the sexes.  The number of food items per load decreased with
   increasing mean prey weight.  The content of the load differed slightly
   between the sexes.  Load weight increased with the age of the nestling
   in females, but not in males.  These results suggest that the sexes may
   differ in their foraging sites.}},

Abstract = {{The study deals with the shore-and waterbirds on 12 low moraine islands
   (areas 2.0-23.6 ha) on the Finnish east coast.  Five of the islands were
   still grazed during the study year or until very recently, while the
   other seven were mostly covered with forest.  Of the shore- and
   waterbirds counted, 86\% nested on the grazed islands.  The density of
   breeding birds was significantly higher on the grazed islands than on
   the ungrazed ones, but there was no statistically significant difference
   in the numbers of species or pairs.
   Although many topographic features of the islands may influence the the
   composition of the bird fauna, there was a significant correlation
   between the proportion of open areas (i.e. low grass meadows and areas
   with scanty bushes) and the density of the shore- and waterbirds.  The
   bird density was 1.5-13.3 pairs/ha on the ungrazed islands (13-26\% open
   areas), and 10.6-74.5 pairs/ha on the grazed islands (28-100\% open

   40\% of a grazed island open would be a practical and cost-effective
   method of ensuring a fairly rich shore- and waterbird fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Nest survival and breeding success were studied in relation to nest site
   at 134 Dunnock nests in southern Finland.  The nests were grouped
   according to three site categories:  1) small spruce, 2) shrub, and 3)
   heap of spruce twigs and branches (brush pile).  Of the 110 nests under
   observation during the egg stage, 56 failed; 54 failures were
   attributable to predation.  During the egg stage the daily survival rate
   of a nest was 91.3\% in spruces, 91.2\% in shrubs, and significantly
   higher, 96.7\%, in brush piles.  The probability of a nest surviving
   throughout the egg stage was 24\%, 23\% and 59\%, in spruces, shrubs and
   brush piles, respectively.  The hatchability of eggs varied from 89.3\%
   in spruces to 95.4\% in brush piles, but the differences were
   non-significant.
   During nestling stage, 10 out of 77 nests were destroyed by predators,
   but no other failures were observed.  The daily survival rate of nests
   varied from 96.8\% in spruces to 99.1\% in shrubs, and the daily
   survival rate of nestlings exceeded 99\%, irrespective of the nest site.
   The differences were non-significant.  The size of first clutches did
   not vary between the nest sites.
   On average, successful nests were better concealed both from above and
   from the sides than failed nests, but no other differences in nest site
   characteristics were found.  The brush pile nests were better concealed
   from the sides than other nests.  Dunnocks used nest sites that offered
   better cover and were surrounded by denser vegetation than potential but
   unoccupied sites.}},

Abstract = {{A density index for territorial male Hazel Grouse Bonasa bonasia in
   spring and autumn is presented and evaluated.  One whistles with a
   hunter's whistle every 30 seconds for 6 minutes from census points
   located at 150-m intervals within the area to be censused, and
   responding Hazel Grouse are counted.  Counts were conducted throughout
   days with little or no wind.  The number of counted males was
   significantly and linearly correlated with the number of known
   territorial males on an intensive study area.  There, 82\% of the
   territorial males responded and were counted.  Response rate appeared to
   be independent of density, based on counts in areas with a 20-fold
   variation in densities.  When censuses were repeated, both results were
   similar.  Within the conditions of these counts, no effects of whether
   or date were found.  However, Hazel Grouse responded less at midday. 
   Using this method, one can count Hazel Grouse at a rate of about 5
   minutes per ha along transects and 5-9 minutes per ha on blocks of
   habitat, depending on plot size.  I recommend that censuses be conducted
   during 4-5 weeks prior to laying in spring and during 4-5 weeks after
   brood dissolution in autumn.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{81-92}},
Abstract = {{In the autumn of 1986 a couple of thousands of northern European Swifts
   did not start on migration but stayed in southern Finland and on the
   eastern coast of Central Sweden. Most Swifts had left Finland by the end
   of August, but a small number returned in mid-September, and the latest
   were seen in the beginning of November. In the course of the autumn no
   new migration could be observed.
   The birds were all adults. They sank into a state reminiscent of
   wintering, and some individuals started moulting in October. The health
   of the birds deteriorated due to shortage of food, and the surviving
   birds perished in the beginning of November when the frost started. No
   decreases were observed in two closely followed breeding colonies in
   southern Finland in 1987, so it is suggested that the late Swifts were
   from central or northern Finland.
   The strict time limits that the northern populations of the Swift have
   for breeding do not allow delayed migration caused by exceptional
   weather conditions as happened in the autumn of 1986, The slow moult
   normally commences in Africa after the autumn migration. In the autumn
   of 1986 the delayed departure of some individuals was due to
   unsuccessful accumulation of fat deposits because of adverse weather
   conditions. After this the birds started to winter, and, the moult
   commencing, it was impossible to migrate.}},

   - AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY}},
Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The size of a forest tract influences the composition of the fauna. If
   forests become fragmented this will affect the fauna in several ways.
   One of the main effects is enhanced nest predation. Several studies
   which confirm this effect have been carried out, but none has used
   natural cavities. I tested experimentally whether the predation rate was
   higher in natural tree-holes close to the forest/farmland edge than in
   the interior of the wood. In a fragmented deciduous forest, fresh Quail
   eggs were placed in natural cavities at various distances from the edge.
   The eggs were exposed during a period corresponding in length to the egg
   and nestling period of a hole-nesting bird. In the beginning of the
   period, the predation rate was higher close to the edge (< 20 m) than
   further inside the wood. This result may indicate that a predator first
   searches the ecotone and afterwards penetrates deeper inside the forest.
   The results is in accord with earlier observations that nests in natural
   cavities seem to be less vulnerable than other types of nests.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Pages = {{105-113}},
Abstract = {{A population of Willow Tits was studied during one breeding season in
   northern Finland, to find out whether copulations outside the pair bond
   (EPCs) occur in this basically monogamous species and whether mate
   guarding operates to prevent EPCs. Only two EPCs and two within-pair
   copulations were seen. The EPCs were not true ones; in both cases, a
   newly widowed female copulated with a paired male from a neighbouring
   territory. During the female's fertile period, average and maximum
   distances between the mates were shorter than during the non-fertile
   stage. During the fertile period, the pairs also spent more time in the
   same trees than during the non-fertile period. In the fertile, but not
   in the non-fertile period, males were the sex that kept near their mates
   by letting the females initiate most of the site changes. There was no
   clear difference in intensity of guarding between adult and juvenile
   males. Thus, male Willow Tits guard their mates during the fertile
   period and the most probable explanation is the avoidance of cuckoldry.
   Despite the rarity of witnessed extra-pair copulations, the existence of
   a mate defence strategy implies that a mixed reproductive strategy could
   exist in the Willow Tit.}},

   three Michigan samples and approached significance (P < 0.06) in a
   fourth. Lowest counts of total species occurred during the fourth hour.
   Individual species varied in hourly trends; some increased during the
   morning, some decreased, and others showed no consistent pattern in

Abstract = {{Tetraonid birds are censused in August and in January-March in the
   Finnish Game triangle scheme, which is based on about 1200 permanent
   triangle-shaped routes, each 12 km in length. We compared the results of
   late-summer and winter censuses in order to develop transformations for
   further use. The summer and winter densities were significantly
   correlated at both the triangle and game district level. When the
   numbers of observations are compared, the winter figures are on average
   20 \% of the late-summer figures in the Capercaillie; the corresponding
   figures are 71, 16 and 125 \% for the Black Grouse, Hazel Hen and Willow
   Grouse, respectively. It should be noted that these are not absolute
   figures and not fully comparable, since the breadth of the census belt
   is 60 m in August whereas the belt breadth in the winter census is not
   known. Using transformations obtained in this study, we transformed the
   old late-summer brood data (1964-85) from southern Finland to relative
   winter figures, in order to have data comparable to those for southern
   Soviet Karelia, where actual winter censuses have been made.  All the
   four species have decreased considerably (-65 \%) in Finland, whilst the
   reverse trend is evident for Karelia (relative change during the period
   +42 \%); the figures of the mid 1980s suggest a similar density in
   Finland and Karelia. The changes in grouse densities partly accord with
   the predictions based on changes in habitat distribution and (other)
   human activities in Finland and Karelia. The paper discusses the
   possibility of deriving estimates of population density from winter
   census data obtained from a census belt of unknown breadth, central
   issues being the basal and lateral detectabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the Finnish Starling Sturnus vulgaris population was
   studied, using data from 20 local populations and from the national
   ringing scheme extending from the beginning of the 1960s to the end of
   the 1980s (data for 7-26 years from each population). According to local
   studies, the population size started to decrease in the late 1960s, and
   fell to about 20\% by the early 1980s. In the timing of the decrease,
   there were clear regional and local differences. Clutch size varied
   significantly among local populations (range of the means of annual
   means in three populations: 4.7-5.3 eggs; data from 12-21 years), but
   there were much greater differences in the number of fledglings (range
   in the same populations: 2.33-3.99 fledglings, with 3.52-4.87 for four
   other populations; data from 5-21 years). These differences were caused
   by differences in foraging habitat. According to national ringing data,
   brood size at the age of ringing increased significantly (by 0.04
   nestlings/year) during the period of 1968-89. The mean brood size
   decreased towards the north. This decline seems be due to large-scale
   abandoning of dairy farming in southern Finland. This has resulted in
   losses of good foraging habitats (pastures and leys) for the Starlings,
   and, as consequence, to reduced reproductive success in the whole south
   Finnish population. The continuous increase of brood size at the age of
   ringing reflects the disappearance of Starlings from poor breeding
   habitats and the strong decrease in northern Finland.}},

Abstract = {{We tested Brown's (1984) explanation of the generally observed positive
   relationship between distribution and abundance of species. The
   hypothesis states that generalized species are widely distributed and
   locally common, and that specialized species are narrowly distributed
   and locally rare. The analysis is based on 327 censuses covering almost
   the whole north-south range of Finland, i.e., ca. 1100 km. The censused
   habitats cover 19 peatland habitat types, ranging from open flark fens
   to forested peatlands. The relationship between distribution and
   abundance was positive for the total avifauna, and also for wader and
   for passerine species. Since the number of observations may affect the
   number of peatland types where the species is observed, we used two
   indices to measure habitat amplitude (a rarefaction estimate and
   Hurlbert's (1978) B'). The species that were able to inhabit several
   mire types had large geographical ranges, but were not locally abundant.
   Thus, in general, the species with a wide habitat amplitude are
   regionally widespread, but not locally abundant. The results do not
   fully support Brown's explanation of the distribution-abundance

Abstract = {{Nestedness patterns have been recommended as a guide in designing
   refuges. The birds of three island archipelagoes and one set of mainland
   quadrats display strongly nested patterns, exactly as do most systems
   studied in this way. Nestedness may be expressed by several statistics,
   which are likely to be highly correlated, and may be viewed from either
   the community-wide or individual species vantagepoint. The latter is
   more informative. Individual species' nestedness scores can be similar
   even though the ecological forces generating them differ greatly.
   Nestedness scores based on island or site area are not directly
   comparable to those based on species richness. It is neither intuitively
   apparent nor empirically demonstrated that extinction would produce
   characteristically different nestedness scores than would colonization.
   Nestedness statistics are closely related to incidence functions in the
   ecological literature and to SLOSS comparisons in the conservation
   literature. None of these statistics is likely to provide much insight
   into refuge design.}},

Abstract = {{Censuses made yearly in 1983-89 were used to study the year-to-year
   variation in bird species assemblages in four localities in virgin
   coniferous forest and four localities in open flark fen. The censuses in
   forests were made in an area of 100 km2 and those in fens in 1000 km2 .
   The variation in the density of the assemblages did not differ between
   the pooled samples from forests and fens or between the separate
   localities. The temporal density variation (V2) of the assemblages in
   separate fens was significantly larger than that of the pooled data of
   the other fens in three out of four cases, whereas no difference was
   observed between separate and pooled samples in coniferous forests. In
   the passerine species the density variation in the different sites was
   similar in magnitude in both forests and fens, whereas the variation in
   waders in fens differed in magnitude between the sites. Compensatory
   fluctuations in the density of species prevailed in the fens, but
   neither compensatory nor parallel fluctuation patterns were observed in
   the bird assemblages in coniferous forests. The results indicate that
   the variation patterns of waders in fens are different from those of
   passerines in fens or forests. Waders are probably more susceptible than
   passerines to environmental variation between sites, such as differences
   in the water level. The fact that the variation of bird assemblages in
   fens was observed to be smaller on a larger spatial scale than the
   variation in separate localities, while this was not the case in
   forests, may be due to differences in species characteristics between
   fens and forests or to the larger spatial scale adopted in the study of
   birds of fens.}},

Abstract = {{A ten-year study of the breeding success of Lesser Black-backed Gulls in
   a mixed colony in the Gulf of Finland revealed a high rate of parental
   failure in years of low rates of provisioning for the chicks.  The
   parents ate their own eggs at the rate of 16\% per annum (range 0-52\%),
   and on average 13\% of the chicks (range 0-25\%) remained unfed.  No
   such anomalies were detected among Herring Gulls in the same colony.
   Both gull species fed on the Baltic Herring, which occurred in 71.8\% of
   the regurgitations of Lesser Black-backed chicks.  The chicks' begging
   behaviour was normal, and the need to guard the nest from local Herring
   Gulls was not observed to restrict the foraging opportunities of the
   Lesser Black-backed adults.
   The Lesser Black-backed parents were divided into three groups according
   to their chick-rearing result.  The least effective group showed no
   response to the variation in the biomass of the spawning Herring stock
   in the Gulf of Finland.  However, the occurrence of this group seemed to
   be connected with some unknown food-related factors.  It is concluded
   that neglect of brood care is either a rough reaction to variation in
   feeding conditions, or the symptom of unknown harmful physiological

Abstract = {{Study of the breeding biology of a small Herring Gull colony off Hanko,
   southern Finland in five seasons, 1978 and 1983-86, showed that the
   gulls occupy the colony in mid-March, arriving in the area a few weeks
   earlier.  Non-breeding cohorts arrive in April and laying begins in the
   second half of April.  Median dates for laying ranged from 25 April to 4
   May.  Laying was related to the ice break-up.  In one season early
   breeders lost eggs due to cold weather.  Clutch-size was close to three,
   and only 11\% of the full clutches had two eggs.  Clutch size decreased
   with season, but variation was pronounced.  Full clutches of three eggs
   were of equal volume in all years, averaging about 28\% of female
   weight.  Only 5 +/- 4.5\% of all eggs laid were lost during incubation. 
   Total losses up to the time of hatching (average 13 +/- 10\%) varied
   significantly between years.  Of the hatched chicks, 29 +/- 13\% died,
   mostly during their first week of life.  On average, only 6 +/- 5\% of
   those surviving the first week died before fledging.  Of the hatched
   chicks, 63 +/- 12\% fledged successfully, the mean number of young
   fledging per pair being 1.55 +/- 0.29.  Chicks left the colony in early
   August.  Compared with other NW European populations, Herring Gulls off
   Hanko breed early, and their breeding success is high.}},
