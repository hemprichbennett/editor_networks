Abstract = {{Because of legal requirements in different countries as well as moral
   and ethical considerations, the effects of behavioral studies on animal
   welfare should be quantified. In this study, the effects of brood
   sampling on juvenile and adult Great Tits (Poecile major) were examined.
   Direct injuries were looked for as a possible short-term effect. We also
   quantified survival until fledging of nestlings that were bled versus
   those that were not bled as a possible medium-term effect, and survival
   until the next breeding season as well as the reproductive success in
   the year following the treatment were investigated as possible long-term
   effects. We found no effects of blood sampling in each of these
   instances.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the temporal characteristics of the foraging
   movements of free-ranging Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus)
   in a mixed-coniferous forest in central Maine to investigate how
   patterns of patch persistence in the wild compared with observations
   from controlled experiments. Persistence in trees, as measured by the
   amount of time from the last prey capture attempt in a tree until exit
   from that tree, was positively correlated with the average amount of
   time between capture attempts in those trees. These observations agree
   with the results of controlled experiments showing more patch
   persistence in the face of unsuccessful search when initial patch
   quality is low than when it is high. Greater persistence in initially
   lower quality patches is consistent with the following two hypotheses
   about patch leaving decision rules: (1) a bird leaves a patch when the
   estimated interval since the last prey capture reaches some value
   relative to the estimated mean inter-capture interval in the environment
   (a flexible giving-up time hypothesis) or (2) a bird leaves a patch when
   the estimated probability of capturing a prey in the next capture
   attempt falls below that estimated for the whole environment (a
   capture-probability hypothesis).}},

Abstract = {{We examined breeding bird species richness, density, and community
   composition on a California desert riparian site in 1980 and, following
   construction of flood control structure and subsequent vegetation
   restoration, again in 1995. Both species richness and bird abundance
   declined markedly between 1980 and 1995. Except for turnover in locally
   scarce breeders, however, avian community composition did not shift
   significantly. Alteration and removal of much of the desert riparian
   habitat formerly on-site is probably responsible for the changes
   reflected in bird community structure, such that richness and density
   are now comparable to Breeding Bird Censuses conducted in other desert
   scrub habitats despite the intermittent stream that still transects the
   site. When examined in a broader context of desert bird community
   variation, overall community changes were slight if we emphasized
   species composition and abundance, but substantial if we emphasized
   species turnover. Community-level analyses emphasizing richness and
   composition are more sensitive to species turnover, whereas those
   incorporating bird density are more sensitive to changes in relative
   abundance.}},

Abstract = {{To guide habitat acquisition for species negatively affected by the
   Exxon Valdez oil spill, I quantified habitat use of Black Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus bachmani) breeding in Prince William Sound, Alaska. I used
   local counts of breeding pairs and Sound-wide transect counts of
   individuals to determine shoreline features that explained variation in
   oystercatcher density. Density of pairs, and occurrence of individuals,
   was greater in areas dominated by shorelines of gradual slopes than in
   areas dominated by steep shorelines. Within areas dominated by steep,
   rocky shorelines, breeding density increased as the proportion of mixed
   sand and gravel beaches and as the number of rocks and small islands
   increased. Shoreline features that explained variation in local pair
   density were corroborated by data from Sound-wide surveys. I
   incorporated information from other studies to construct a general,
   qualitative decision-tree model that predicts that disturbance-free
   shorelines of gradual slopes should support the highest densities of
   breeding Black Oystercatchers. Qualitative and quantitative models
   should be tested to determine their applicability to shoreline habitat
   throughout the oystercatcher's range.}},

Abstract = {{Most previous studies of habitat use by migratory birds in the tropics
   have used either mist nets or point counts to assess relative densities
   of migrants among habitats. We used both methods on the same 30 sites in
   southern Veracruz: 10 sites in forest (canopy >10 m), 10 sites in second
   growth (canopy 3-10 m), and 10 sites in the open (canopy <3 m). Results
   demonstrate that either method used alone is likely to underestimate or
   miss whole categories of species. Three aerial or canopy-foraging
   species found on point counts were missed by mist netting, while several
   others in these categories were under-represented in mist net samples,
   especially in forest habitats. Nine species represented in mist net
   samples were not recorded in point counts, probably because of low
   density and/or secretive habits. The strengths of one method tend to
   offset the weaknesses of the other, and we propose a methodology that
   combines both procedures to provide a more accurate assessment of avian
   habitat use.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to assess whether egg measurements could be used to
   discriminate accurately eggs of Ross's (Chen rossii) and Lesser Snow
   Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens). We used lengths and widths of
   eggs found in nests of known species at Arlone Lake in 1963 and Karrak
   Lake, Northwest Territories, in 1968, 1976, 1988, and 1991-1996.
   Although accuracy of classification varied slightly among years,
   discriminant function analyses were 89-100\% successful in identifying
   species based on dimensions of individual eggs and clutch means. Bias in
   estimates of species ratios, which reflects combined effects of
   misclassifications in both species, was only 2\% in favor of Ross's
   Geese when all years were pooled. Sir, conclude that classification
   equations, derived from discriminant function analyses using
   known-species eggs, are reliable and objective techniques for
   determining species of eggs and nests of unknown origin at Ross's and
   Snow Goose colonies.}},

   Akohekohe retained all juvenal primaries, some juvenal secondaries, and
   some body feathers after the first prebasic molt; they attained full
   adult plumage after the second prebasic molt. Retention of brown juvenal
   body feathers, especially on the head, distinguished most birds in the
   first basic plumage from adults, which have a full complement of
   distinctive, black lanceolate body feathers dth white, gray, or orange
   tips. Male Akohekohe were heavier than females and had longer wing,
   tail, and tarsometatarsus lengths. We present a linear discriminant
   function to sex both adults and juveniles using lengths of their wing
   and tarsometatarsus.}},

Abstract = {{The Colortron (Light Source, San Rafael, California) is an inexpensive,
   compact, Macintosh-compatible reflectance spectrophotometer that can be
   used to quantify the coloration of the plumage and soft parts of birds.
   The Colortron provides a reflectance spectrum (390-700 nm) of the object
   being measured as well as tristimulus color scores that can be compared
   to scores from the Methuen or Munsell color references. Because the
   Colortron fails to measure ultraviolet light (wavelength <390 nm), which
   is visible to some species of birds, Colortron output must be
   interpreted cautiously when it is used to describe plumage that may
   reflect UV, especially if the focus of the study is understanding the
   function of coloration. The Colortron is especially useful for
   quantifying carotenoid-based plumage coloration, which reflects
   primarily in the visible spectrum. I compared visual scores of
   carotenoid-based ornamental plumage of House Finches (Carpodacus
   mexicanus) made by comparison to The Methuen Handbook of Colour to
   tristimulus color scores generated by the Colortron. Hue and saturation
   scores from visual assessment were significantly positively correlated
   with hue and saturation scores from the Colortron. I recommend the use
   of the Colortron as a means to quantify plumage and soft-part
   coloration.}},

Abstract = {{We summarized 40 reports of nine species of brood parasites feeding
   young of their own species. These observations suggest that the
   propensity to provision young has not been lost entirely in brood
   parasites despite the belief that brood parasitic adults abandon their
   offspring at the time of laying. The hypothesis that species that
   participate in courtship feeding are more likely to precision young was
   not supported: provisioning of young has been observed in two species of
   brood parasites that do not courtship feed. The function of this
   provisioning is unknown, but we suggest it may be: (1) a non-adaptive
   vestigial behavior or (2) an adaptation to ensure adequate care of
   parasitic young. The former is more likely the case. Further studies are
   required to determine whether parasitic adults commonly feed their
   genetic offspring.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored 59 Lewis' Woodpecker ((Melanerpes lewis) nests in
   southeastern Colorado during the 1992 and 1993 breeding seasons in order
   to determine the possible impact of competition with European Starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris) for nest cavities. I recorded 73 interspecific
   interactions during 418 hours of observation. Out of the 59 breeding
   Lewis' Woodpecker pairs observed, only one lost its nest cavity to
   starlings. Lewis' Woodpeckers were dominant in over 90\% of the
   interspecific interactions with European Starlings, and such
   interactions occurred infrequently (1.7 interactions/10 h of
   observation). The nesting phenologies of the two species overlapped
   minimally because Lewis' Woodpeckers initiated breeding approximately
   4-6 wk after European Starlings. These data suggest that, at least in
   southeastern Colorado, European Starlings are not major nest-cavity
   competitors of Lewis' Woodpeckers, and that widespread population
   declines observed in Lewis' Woodpeckers may be due to other factors.}},

Abstract = {{Sex ratio is a parameter of interest in many population studies. A key
   assumption of these studies is that the trapping method used does not
   bias the estimate of sex ratio in the sampled population. We use
   capture-recapture data of 2324 Serins (Serinus serinus) trapped in
   northeast Spain from 1985-1992 with Yunich platform traps and clap nets
   to test this assumption. Results show that in autumn the platform trap
   captured fewer females than expected by chance. This is probably due to
   dominant males monopolizing the small baited surface of the trap (trap:
   0.36 vs. clap net: 3.24 m(2)). The data additionally show a real
   increase in the proportion of males from autumn to winter, which may be
   related to differential mortality of the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the breeding ecology of Interior Least Terns (Sterna
   antillarum athalassos) on the unregulated Yellowstone River, Montana. In
   1994-1996, we estimated hydrologic patterns, population size, habitat
   use, and breeding success along 200 km of river. We sampled habitat
   availability on 105 km of river during the 1995 breeding season. In
   1994, river flows peaked early and were low throughout the breeding
   season. In 1995 and 1996, flows were more typical of the
   long-term-average hydrograph, Annual variation in estimates of the
   breeding population and the timing of nesting corresponded with annual
   variation in hydrology. We counted 40 adults (18 nests) in 1994, 21
   adults (11 nests) in 1995, and 19 adults (6 nests) in 1996. Terns nested
   earlier in 1994 than in 1995 or 1996. During the peak period of nest
   initiation in 1995, the only nesting habitat available in 105 km of
   river was on eight vegetated channel bars. Almost all (32 of 35) nests
   were on bare cobble on the upstream portions of vegetated channel bars.
   Despite wide fluctuations in river flows, no nests were inundated. Nest
   success was 89\% in 1994, 64\% in 1995, and 100\% in 1996. Annual
   variation in breeding numbers, clutch size, nest success, and chick
   survival caused large differences in annual estimates of recruitment (23
   fledglings in 1994, 1 in 1995, and 4 in 1996). Although annual estimates
   of breeding numbers and nest-initiation dates varied according to yearly
   hydrologic patterns, annual variation in nest success and chick survival
   seemed unrelated to changes in river-flow rates. Poor recruitment in
   1995 seemed to be most strongly influenced by weather events. Unlike on
   rivers with human-altered flows, predation and human disturbance did not
   appear to influence recruitment greatly.}},

Abstract = {{We used mist nets to quantify the abundance and habitat use of birds in
   three habitats on San Salvador, Bahamas, during the winters of 1994,
   1996, and 1997. Thirty species were captured, of which 28 (12 permanent
   and 16 winter residents) were regular community members. Permanent
   residents composed 40\% of species in all habitats, and parulid warblers
   (13 species) dominated the winter-resident community. The number of
   migrant species was virtually identical to that of other Bahama islands
   that are larger and/or closer to the North American continent. Disturbed
   habitat yielded the most species (24) and highest capture I ate (103
   birds/100 net h), followed by mangrove (17 species and 51 birds/100 net
   h) and thickets (14 species and 60 birds/100 net h). Capture rates of
   migrants were relatively constant across years (30-38 birds/100 net h),
   with the possible exception of declines in White-eyed Vireos (Vireo
   griseus). Annual variation in capture rates of permanent resident was
   high (30-64 birds/100 net h) due to a decline of Bananaquits (Coerba
   flaveola) in 1997. Bananaquits also showed a significant decline in body
   condition in 1997. We attribute both phe nomena to the impact of
   Hurricane Lilly on Bananaquit food supplies. Six species exhibited
   narrow habitat preferences (three in mangroves, three in disturbed),
   whereas three others were habitat generalists. Mangroves were the
   primary or secondary habitat for six species, whereas ten species used
   the disturbed area either exclusively or as a secondary site. Thickets
   were the preferred habitat of only one species (Thick-billed Vireo; V
   crassirostris). Lightly disturbed areas and mangroves serve as important
   habitats for nearctic migrants and permanent residents on San Salvador.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed food provisioning of Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) chicks
   at a colony in the Azores, 16 Jun.-5 Jul. 1995. Prey offered to chicks
   and feeding frequency were examined in relation to the age of the chick,
   fish size, and time of day. Overall, Trumpet fish (Macroramphosus
   scolopax) predominated in the diet, but sauri (Scomberesox saurus and
   Nanichthys simulans), mackerel (Trachurus picturatus), garfish (Belone
   belone gracilis), and lanternfish (Myctophidae) were important on
   certain days. Mostly epipelagic fish were taken, but mesopelagic fish
   became more common prey as the season progressed. Garfish were delivered
   in morning and lanternfish were ingested mostly around mid-dal: when
   provisioning of other prey types was lower. Prey ingestion by chicks was
   influenced by age, with young birds ingesting thinner prey (sauri,
   garfish, and mackerel) and not consuming wider prey (trumpet fish and
   boarfish, Capros aper) Feeding frequency increased with chick age and
   varied significantly with time of day, being higher in early morning and
   lower in early afternoon. Mean length of fish consumed by chicks
   increased significantly with chick age for common prey species.
   Variability of Roseate Tern chick diet in the Azores can be explained by
   changes in the availability of fish species and changes in the adults'
   selection criteria as their chicks grew.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian areas of the western United States are important breeding and
   migration habitats for migrant landbirds. To develop reliable methods
   for surveying and monitoring riparian avifaunas, we evaluated the
   relative efficiency and comparability of fixed-width line transects,
   spot mapping, and fixed-radius point counts. Intensive, single-visit
   spot mapping yielded greater species richness and higher total relative
   abundances than line transacts for all riparian habitats combined, but
   these differences largely disappeared when comparisons were made within
   habitat types (meadow, willow, and aspen). There were no differences in
   numbers of species or relative abundances in comparisons between
   transects and point counts. Transects and point counts conducted once
   per plot missed many birds compared with two-visit samples. We recommend
   that monitoring programs for birds in western riparian habitats provide
   substantive, standardized training for observers, and use either
   fixed-width line transects or fixed-radius point counts with at least
   two visits per site for breeding season surveys.}},

   them were documented as having returned to the study area that same

   breeding in their original nestbox with their original mate, Another
   three males returned to the study site the following pear. Tree swallows
   have excellent homing ability, and are strongly motivated to return to

Abstract = {{We compared habitat characteristics in plots used by Blackburnian
   Warblers (Dendroica fusca) to randomly selected paired plots in a high
   Andean native secondary forest in Colombia. Density of trees in all

   density of native trees and shrubs were higher on the bird-centered
   plots. Percent vegetation cover (0-1 m, 1-2 m and 2-3 m above the
   ground) was lower at bird-centered plots. Blackburnian Warblers avoided
   non-native trees species, represented mainly by Eucalyptus globulus in
   the study area, and preferred native tree species. They preferred the
   higher part of trees in the middle and high dbh classes. They avoided
   the smallest dbh size class (3-8 cm dbh). Management for conservation of
   Blackburnian Warbler wintering habitat should emphasize maintenance of
   relatively mature native forests. Conversion of native forests to
   non-native tree species will reduce the amount of suitable Blackburnian
   Warbler habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We used playback of rail vocalizations and improved trap design to
   enhance capture of fall migrant Soras (Porzana carolina) and Virginia
   Rails (Rallus limicola) in marshes bordering the tidal Patuxent River,
   Maryland. Custom-fabricated microchip message-repeating sound systems
   provided digitally recorded sound for long-life, high-quality playback.
   A single sound system accompanied each 30-45-m long drift fence trap
   line fitted with 1-3 cloverleaf traps. Ramped funnel entrances improved
   retention of captured rails and deterred raccoon (Procyon lotor)
   predation. Use of playback and improved trap design increased trap
   success by over an order of magnitude and resulted in capture and
   banding of 2315 Soras and 276 Virginia Rails during September and
   October 1993-1997. The Sera captures more than doubled the banding
   records for the species in North America. This capture success
   demonstrates the efficacy of banding large numbers of Soras and Virginia
   Rails on migration and winter concentration areas.}},

Abstract = {{We radio-tagged and monitored adult female Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa
   umbellus) with broods to evaluate effects of habitat management on
   home-range size and patterns of habitat use. Experimental habitat
   management consisted of short-rotation clearcutting of 1-ha forest
   patches to create various-aged forest stands of mixed oak (Quercus spp.)
   and aspen (Populus tremuloides, P. gradidentata)/scrub oak (Q.
   Ilicifolia, Q. prinoides). Home range size was not significantly
   different between grouse occupying managed and an adjacent unmanaged
   forest. Female grouse with broods selected mixed oak/scrub oak habitats
   and avoided herbaceous areas, recent clearcuts, and pitch pine (Pinus
   rigida)/scrub oak habitats throughout the study area. On the managed
   area, grouse selected 10-yr-old clearcut patches in mixed oak and
   aspen/scrub oak. Sites used by grouse had higher densities of woody
   stems 2.5-7.5-cm dbh, greater \% cover of live vegetation at 0-2 m, and
   were closer to edges and openings than random sites. Habitat management
   practices positively affected one microhabitat component, distance to
   nearest edge, that was selected by female grouse with broods.}},

   banded 30 Henslow's Sparrows and recaptured 13 individuals a total of 20
   times. All birds were recaptured in the site where they were originally
   banded. No movement between sites was detected. No birds banded in 1995
   were recaptured in 1996. Our data suggest that Henslow's Sparrows tend

Abstract = {{Subcutaneously implanted transponders have proved to be a reliable means
   of identifying individual penguins. We found survival of Adelie Penguins
   (Pygoscelis adeliae) carrying transponders over five seasons to be equal
   to or better than that of birds with flipper bands, although not
   statistically significant on an annual basis. There were, however
   occasional problems associated with the use of implanted transponders.
   The transponder removed from one bird had developed a slimy biofilm
   harboring potentially pathogenic organisms incorporated at the time of
   implantation. If such contamination is common, it is possible that the
   long-term survival of groups of birds carrying implanted transponders
   may be lower than that of unmarked populations. Migration of
   transponders away from the injection site has also been demonstrated and
   may compromise survival in some individuals. These risk factors could
   limit the use of implanted identification devices in long-lived or
   endangered species. Introduction of bacteria can be minimized by careful
   injection techniques and cleansing of instruments and skin with iodine
   or alcohol. The choice of a suitable implantation site, such as midway
   down the back, from which transponders may migrate without impinging
   upon vital structures is also important. The believe that transponders,
   when used with care, provide a useful alternative to flipper bands in
   demographic studies of penguins.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus) was
   studied during the 1990 and 1991 breeding seasons in Baja California
   Sur, Mexico. Sixteen nests were monitored in 1990 and six in 1991. The
   breeding season extended from February-August. Caracaras were more
   abundant during the post-fledging period (October-November) when up to
   1.2 birds/km were registered in road surveys. The cardon cactus
   (Pachycereus pringlei) was the most used structure for nesting (76\% of
   nests), although other tree-like structures were also used. Nest
   material consisted mainly of twigs of rama parda (Ruellia peninsularis),
   coralvine (Antigonon leptopus) and condalia (Condalia globosa). Nesting
   success estimated using the Mayfield method was 0.75 and 0.38 in 1990
   and 1991, respectively Mean (+/-SD) productivity was 2.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.8
   +/- 0.7 fledglings per successful nest in 1990 and 1991, respectively.
   Five second clutches were registered. The productivity of the Cape
   region Crested Caracara population was similar to that reported for
   caracaras in Texas but higher than in Arizona.}},

Abstract = {{In 1993-1994, we used artificial nests to study relationships between
   nest success and various spatial, temporal, and vegetation variables in
   three grassland types: Conservation Reserve Program (CRF) fields, held
   borders and watercourses, and native vegetation. Nest success was higher
   and vegetation was structurally more complex in CRP fields than in other
   grassland types. Nest success was 63\% in CRP fields but only 24\% in
   native vegetation. Results of univariate and multivariate analyses
   indicated that nests surrounded by taller, thicker cover were more
   likely to survive than nests with less concealing vegetation. Nests
   initiated later in the season, when vegetation volume was greater,
   survived at higher rates than nests initiated earlier. Spatial variables
   were not strongly related to nest success. Field size was directly
   related to nest success in CRP fields but not ill other grassland types.
   However, field size was not included in the most parsimonious,
   multivariate model of factors related to nest success in CRP fields.
   Similarly, proximity to field borders was not related to nest success in
   any grassland type. Our results suggest that CRP fields, which cover a
   large area in the Northern Great Plains and attract a greater diversity
   of grassland birds than the cropfields they replaced, provide secure
   nesting cover for ground-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura) population indices for the western
   United States have declined significantly since 1966. Based on data
   collected in 1951-1952, in Fillmore, Utah, we examined whether there had
   been a local decline in the dove population index since the original
   data were collected. We then determined whether habitat had been
   altered, identified which foraging habitats doves preferred, and
   assessed whether changes in land use could be responsible, in part, for
   a decline in the local population index. We found that dove population
   indices declined 72\% and 82\% from 1952-1992 and 1952-1993,
   respectively. The most dramatic change in habitat was an 82\% decline in
   land devoted to dry land winter wheat production and a decline in
   livestock feed pens. Doves foraged primarily in harvested wheat fields,
   feed pens, and weedy patches. We hypothesize that a decrease in wheat
   availability during the spring and the consolidation of the livestock
   industry have contributed to a population decline of Mourning Doves in
   central Utah.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the ability of three techniques to estimate density of Blue
   Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) on a series of 3.1-ha plots in eight habitat
   types in south-central Florida. Estimates generated from fixed-radius
   point counts (r = 30 m and 100 m) and the variable circular-plot
   technique were compared to actual density of adult jays as measured from
   number of active nests in each plot during the study period. Based on
   analyses at the level of the plot (n = 29), estimates from all three
   techniques were positively correlated with actual density (r(s) greater
   than or equal to 0.53, P less than or equal to 0.003). On average, the
   100-m fixed-radius technique underestimated density (P = 0.008), whereas
   the other techniques neither under-nor overestimated density (P > 0.4).
   The slope of the regression of estimated density on actual density was
   significantly less than 1.0 for the 100-m fixed-radius (P < 0.001) and
   variable circular-plot (P = 0.001) techniques, indicating those
   techniques tended to overestimate density when actual density was low
   and underestimate density when actual density was high. Magnitude of
   error increased with actual density for all three techniques. Overall
   variability in density estimation was greater for the 30-m fixed-radius
   technique; however, because the direction of error was random across the
   range of actual density correlations between estimates and actual
   density for this technique were stronger than for other techniques when
   plot-based values were averaged across habitats. Overall, the 30-m
   fixed-radius technique performed better than the other techniques based
   on analyses at both the levels of plot and habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue preservation is a challenge faced by researchers collecting eggs
   in the field. Use of stable isotope analyses of eggs will undoubtedly
   increase as a means to trace directly avian trophic relationships and
   nutrient allocation to reproduction, and so field preservation
   techniques that do not alter stable-isotope ratios are needed. We
   evaluated effects of several preservation techniques on stable-carbon
   (C-13/C-12) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14) isotope ratios in lipid-free yolk
   and albumen, and stable-carbon isotope ratios in yolk lipid. Drying,
   freezing, boiling then freezing eggs, and storage of egg components in
   70\% ethanol did not alter stable-carbon and nitrogen isotope abundance
   in egg components, and we recommend these preservation techniques prior
   to isotopic analysis. Boiling eggs prior to freezing facilitates future
   separation of albumen and yolk. Maintaining boiled eggs at 6 C for 7 d
   reduced C-13 abundance in lipid-free yolk, while maintenance at 6 C for
   50 d increased N-15 abundance in albumen. Preservation in Formalin
   should be avoided as it reduced C-13 abundance in lipid-free yolk and
   albumen but did not affect yolk lipids.}},

Abstract = {{We studied Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) at Goosewing Beach, Rhode
   Island during 1993 and 1994. Broods with access to sail-pond mudflat
   habitat experienced higher fledging success (3.0 fledglings/brood) than
   broods limited to ocean beachfront habitat (1.4 fledglings/brood). This
   difference may be attributed to greater survivorship among chicks with
   access to mudflat habitat. Broods using pondshore mudflat habitat spent
   less time responding to human disturbance (1.6\%) than chicks using
   ocean beachfront habitat (17.0\%). The difference in time spent feeding
   between pondshore (77.5\%) and ocean beachfront (51.2\%) habitats
   approached statistical significance. Salt pond water levels were
   artificially manipulated to increase availability of mudflat habitat for
   plover chicks, though the effect of such manipulation on Piping Plover
   reproductive success remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{The chronology of nesting events was examined in Western Sandpipers
   (Calidris mauri) and Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla) breeding at
   Nome, Alaska. The duration of laying (5 d for a 4-egg clutch) and
   hatching (53.0 +/- 26.6 SD h, dry chicks to emerge from star-pipped
   eggs) was similar for both species. Laying rates of Semipalmated
   Sandpipers at Nome were slower than other populations, possibly because
   laying intervals were greater than 30 h. Length of incubation was
   significantly longer in Western (21.5 +/- 0.5 d) than Semipalmated
   Sandpipers (20.3 +/- 1.9 d). Early clutches had significantly higher
   hatching success than late clutches in Semipalmated Sandpipers (60.0\%,
   n = 105 vs. 22.9\%, n = 70) but not Western Sandpipers (68.2\%, n = 88

Abstract = {{From 1991-1994, we quantified relative abundance and reproductive
   success of the Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis), Northern Harrier
   (Circus cyaneus), Burrowing Owl (Speotyto cunicularia), and Short-eared
   Owl (Asio flammeus) on the shrubsteppe plateaus (benchlands) in and near
   the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwestern
   Idaho. To assess relative abundance, we searched randomly selected plots
   using four sampling methods: point counts, line transects, and quadrats
   of two sizes. On a per-sampling-effort basis, transects were slightly
   more effective than point counts and quadrats for locating raptor nests
   (3.4 pairs detected/100 h of effort vs. 2.2-3.1 pairs). Random sampling
   using quadrats failed to detect a Short-eared Owl population increase
   from 1993 to 1994. To evaluate nesting success, we tried to determine
   reproductive outcome for all nesting attempts located during random,
   historical, and incidental nest searches. We compared nesting success
   estimates based on all nesting attempts, on attempts found during
   incubation, and the Mayfield model. Most pairs used to evaluate success
   were pairs found incidentally. Visits to historical nesting areas
   yielded the highest number of pairs per sampling effort (14.6/100 h),
   but reoccupancy rates for most species decreased through time. Estimates
   based on all attempts had the highest sample sizes but probably
   overestimated success for all species except the Ferruginous Hawk.
   Estimates of success based on nesting attempts found during incubation
   had the lowest sample sizes. All three methods yielded biased nesting
   success estimates for the Northern Harrier and Short-eared Owl. The
   estimate based on pairs found during incubation probably provided the
   least biased estimate for the Burrowing Owl. Assessments of nesting
   success were hindered by difficulties in confirming egg laying and
   nesting success for all species except the Ferruginous hawk.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine if the patterns of chick growth and mortality
   observed in two-chick broods of the Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis
   antarctica) are affected by the feeding capacity of parents, we
   performed an experimental brood reduction at hatching by removing one
   sibling in some broods and comparing the growth and mortality patterns
   of these single chicks with those of control broods with two chicks.
   Chicks in reduced broods had longer flippers than those in control
   broods at 15, 21 and 47 days of age, and longer bills at 15, 21 and 32
   days, but no differences in mass were found. Although more control than
   reduced broods suffered chick mortality the productivity of control
   broods was markedly higher. Brood size has significant effects on final
   chick size in the Chinstrap penguin. Food limitation operated mainly at
   the end of the guard stage, although its effects were still significant
   during the creche stage. Although the effect of brood size on growth may
   be more marked in last-hatched chicks, it can also be noted in
   first-hatched chicks. Growth may act as a fine-tuning mechanism to
   regulate productivity in this species, allowing parents to raise two
   chicks, but at the cost of slower growth and smaller final size.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of capture and handling procedures that influence
   survival of waterfowl has important research and management
   implications. We captured 347 female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta)
   using rocket nets, fitted them with harness (backpack-type) radio
   transmitters, and monitored their survival during the first 10 d
   following release. Fe males were 16 times more likely to die during the
   first 4 d of exposure than during days 5-10. Survival of females
   captured with small numbers of waterfowl (n less than or equal to 172)
   was nor related to holding time (time from capture until release), but
   survival of females captured with large numbers of waterfowl (n = 594)
   declined as holding time increased. Survival did not vary with age
   (immature or adult) or body condition (body mass adjusted for bed?;
   size) of females. Survival was positively related to flight quality
   (scored as poor, moderate, or good) of females upon release; poor and
   moderate fliers were twice as likely to die as those scored in the next
   higher level of flight quality. Flight quality of females captured with
   small numbers of waterfowl was unrelated to holding lime, but that of
   females captured with large numbers of waterfowl declined as holding
   time increased. In all cases where cause of mortalities could be
   determined (n = 12), we attributed proximate cause of death to
   predation. We recommend that holding time of ducks be minimized,
   particularly for those captured with large numbers of waterfowl in
   rocket nets.}},

Abstract = {{We developed and tested a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) for the
   Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla; LOWA). The model was created
   based oil existing literature and verified using presence data within
   central Pennsylvania. Our LOWA HSI, based on the United States Fish and
   Wildlife Service (USFWS) Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) format,
   consists of eight variables including cover, food, and nesting factors.
   Model variables include measures of canopy cover; shrub cover and
   height; ratio of deciduous to coniferous cover; herbaceous cover and
   height; stream order and microtopography; stream clarity and substrate,
   presence of overturned root masses; stream bank slope and cover type;
   and landscape classification. Three independent data sets were used to
   test our model. Two data sets (T-1 and T-2) included sites
   characterizing a range of habitat conditions; the third set of data
   (T-3) focused on good to optimal LOWA nesting habitat. Median HSI values
   were significantly higher on sites occupied by LOWA for T-1 (0.80 and
   0.67, sites with LOWA presence and absence, respectively) and T-2 (0.76
   and 0.23). HSI scores for T-1 and T-2 spanned across the 0-1 scale
   (0.13-1.0, and 0.04-0.89, respectively). HSI values for T-3 were not
   significantly higher in relation to presence or absence of LOWA (median
   HSI scores 0.93 and 0.88, respectively). Based on the model's
   performance and field observations, LOWA show a strong preference for
   unpolluted, headwater streams and their associated wetlands occurring in
   contiguous forest.}},

Abstract = {{Previous Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura) nesting studies conducted in
   areas containing a mixture of edge and continuous habitats have focused
   on edge habitats. Consequently, little is known about the potential
   contribution of continuous habitats to dove production. In this study we
   evaluated the relative importance of these two extensive habitat types
   by monitoring the habitat use and nest success of 59 radio-marked doves
   during 1990-1991 in central Missouri. Of 83 nests initiated by our
   marked sample, most (81.9\%) were located in edge habitats. Although
   continuous habitats were selected less as nest sites, the proportion of
   successful nests did not differ significantly from chat in edge
   habitats. Our data indicate that continuous habitats should not be
   considered marginal nesting habitat. If the intensify of use and nest
   success that we observed are representative regionally or nationally,
   continuous habitats could contribute substantially to annual Mourning
   Dove production because of the high availability of these habitats
   throughout much of the Mourning Dove breeding range.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the effects of radio transmitters on Wood Thrushes
   (Hylocichla mustelina) using 4 yr of banding and telemetry data from
   Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, Georgia. Flight performance models
   suggest that the 1.6-g transmitter shortens the migratory range of wood
   thrushes by only 60 km, and the estimated migratory range is adequate to
   accomplish migration even with limited fat stores. We used two strengths
   of line, 5- and 9-kg test-strength braided Dacron, to attach the
   transmitters using the thigh-harness method. We recaptured 13 returning
   radio-marked wood thrushes, seven of which were still marked. Six of the
   seven birds marked with the 5-kg rest harnesses lost their transmitters
   within 1 yr while all six of the 9-kg test harnesses were still attached
   up to 21 mo later. Radio-marking did not reduce the return rates of
   adults and immatures, and the transmitters did not cause radio-marked
   birds to lose more mass than banded-only birds. Wood Thrushes can
   successfully carry a transmitter during migration with no detectable
   negative effects. We recommend continued use of the thigh-harness
   method, but we encourage the use of 5-kg cotton line.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in remote sensing technologies allow researchers to
   inventory and study bird populations at large spatial scales. We used
   National Weather Service WSR-88D weather surveillance radar images,
   acquired from the Internet, to detect and map the locations of Purple
   Martin (Progne subis) pre-migratory roosts across the eastern United
   States. Purple Martins form a distinctive ring or annulus on radar
   during pre-dawn departures from roosts, allowing mapping of roost sites
   based on this signature. Overall, we identified 33 roost sites from 13
   states. Although most roosts were confined to the southeastern United
   States, sites as far north as Missouri and Kentucky and as far west as
   central Texas and Oklahoma were detected. Seventy-three percent (24/33)
   of roosts were clearly associated with large bodies of water such as
   lakes and rivers. We found that using Internet-acquired radar images for
   bird studies had limitations when compared with direct acquisition of
   images from WSR-88D radar stations or through contracts with WSR-88D
   product providers. However, the increased expertise and financial
   investment associated with these methods make Internet-acquired radar
   data an attractive alternative for rapid assessment of roost locations
   and dynamics over large geographical areas.}},

Abstract = {{Nestling and adult Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) banded and
   observed ill the Greater Yellowstone region of northwestern Wyoming and
   southeastern Idaho displayed previously unrecorded plumage and talon
   coloration, Atypical characteristics were noted in nine nestling and
   three adult Bald Eagles associated with the Snake River watershed
   between 1979 and 1989. Atypical plumage in nestlings was characteristic
   of genetically based pied plumage (i.e., feathers either completely
   white or completely brown, not diluted, speckled, or partially albino).
   Pied plumage in nestlings was manifested as one or all of the following
   abnormal characteristics: a wedge of white feathers on the crown, white
   breast patch, white chin, abdomen, and crissum feathers, white epaulets,
   and in one case, a completely white primary feather. One parent of a
   brood of affected nestlings exhibited atypical characteristics while
   parents of another brood were normal. Pied plumage of adults was
   characterized by small white breast patches, white feathers on the
   lateral crus, white feathers on the leading edge of the patagium, and/or
   white epaulets. Similar atypical plumage and talons were recorded in
   Golden Eagles. Pied plumage was expressed only in female Bald Eagles and
   was associated with white (normally black) talons in both nestlings and
   adults and pal; tially yellow (normally all black) cere in nestlings.
   Pied plumage may be masked in definitive plumage of Bald Eagles or at
   least not obvious when viewed from a distance. Pied plumage in nestling
   Bald Eagles may be unique to Greater Yellowstone and proximity of
   affected eagles exhibiting pied plumage indicated close genetic
   relationship among resident breeding pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Nasal markers (saddles and discs) are used commonly to identify

   indices of nesting effort for wild Mallards in the prairie pothole
   region of south-central Canada. Nasal discs did nor significantly
   influence the proportion of birds that remained on the study area, the
   proportion of birds that nested, the number of nests initiated per bird,
   the total number of days a given bird devoted to laying or incubating
   eggs, or the proportion of birds that successfully hatched a nest.
   Compared to unmarked birds, however, nasal-marked birds did
   significantly delay their first nest by 2-6 days. Investigators should

Abstract = {{Annual variation in the breeding success of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia
   sialis) nesting in five types of cavities was assessed over 27 yr near
   Green Bay, Wisconsin. We found slight but statistically significant
   variation in clutch size, the fraction of young hatched, banded, and
   surviving from hatching to banding, and the percentage of banded young
   that returned to the study population. Breeding success was
   significantly greater in Open Top than in Standard boxes for all
   measures except return rate. Success improved slightly over the course
   of the study in Standard boxes, probably because of gradual improvements
   in box design. Total nest failure was the main factor influencing
   nesting success, and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), House Sparrows
   (Passer domesticus), cats (Felis domesticus), and raccoons (Procyon
   lotor) were the major causes. Total nest failure was significantly lower
   in Open Top boxes than in Standard boxes, probably because sparrows and
   wrens prefer cavities with closed tops. As a result, where these two box
   types are used together and sparrows and wrens are common, bluebirds are
   probably being produced at lower rates than could be obtained if only
   Open Top boxes were employed.}},

Abstract = {{Post-ovulatory follicles (POFs) are often used to estimate egg
   production of collected birds, especially in studies of nutrient-reserve
   dynamics of laying waterfowl. We assessed the reliability of this
   technique in American Coots (Fulica americana) by conducting macroscopic
   and microscopic POF counts and comparing these estimates with egg counts
   obtained through frequent nest monitoring. Macroscopic POF counts were
   unreliable, but microscopic counts were significantly correlated with
   known clutch size (r = 0.74, n = 12, P = 0.006). On average, microscopic
   POF counts differed from known clutch size by -0.42 (SD = 1.51), which
   represented approximately -4\% bias and 15\% measurement error. Errors
   in POF counts were likely due to rapid regression of POFs or to
   mis-identification of atretic follicles. We used simulation modeling to
   assess the effects of such errors on estimates of nutrient commitment to
   clutch formation. Our simulations showed that small errors in POF counts
   are unlikely to have any serious effects; investigators concerned with
   low power and precision could benefit most by obtaining adequate sample
   sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal surveys using auditory cues and night-vision equipment were
   conducted during die seabird breeding season in 1993 to determine use of
   inland areas in the Puna District, Hawaii by Newell's Shearwater
   (Puffinus auricularis newelli). Two hundred sixty Newell's Shearwater
   auditory or visual detections were made during 275 survey hours from 23
   Jul, 1993-20 Sep. 1993. Mean detection rates were 1.26 birds/h at
   Puulena Crater (rt = 160 Newell's Shearwater detections), 1.05 birds/h
   at Heiheiahulu (n = 99) and 0.04 birds/h at Puu Kaliu (n = 2).
   Vocalizing peaked between 50 and 90 min after sunset and 4 h before
   sunrise. Although night-vision equipment was used on most of the seabird
   surveys, only 4\% of seabirds were detected visually. Two road-killed
   birds collected in Puna in June 1993, and four burrows located in
   Puulena Crater after the 1994 breeding season, provided additional
   evidence of breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial nests have become an important tool for avian ecologists.
   Results obtained with artificial nests are sometimes used to predict
   success of natural nests or to characterize spatio-temporal changes in
   success of natural nests, but only rarely is success of artificial and
   natural nests actually compared. We found no correlation between success
   of natural and artificial duck nests in the same year, nor did
   artificial nests accurately portray between-year changes in survival of
   natural nests. Furthermore, despite extensive experience working with
   natural duck nests, we were unable to place artificial nests in
   locations that matched vegetative characteristics of natural nest sites.
   Natural nests had denser taller vegetation than artificial ones.
   Overhead concealment was greater at successful natural nests, but no
   difference was found with artificial nests. Researchers should be
   cautious when using artificial nests to predict natural nest success and
   should be aware of possible differences in vegetative features that may
   affect nest survival.}},

Abstract = {{We summarize data on seasonality and relative abundance of shorebirds in
   the Mariana Islands based on bi-weekly surveys on Saipan (1987-1993) and
   Guam (1980-1981), and miscellaneous counts and records from all 15
   islands. Of 46 species documented (36 Scolopacidae, 7 plovers, 1 silt, 1
   oystercatcher, 1 pratincole), only the Pacific Golden-Plover (Pluvialis
   fulva) is abundant. The Whimbrel (Numenius phaeophus), Gray-tailed
   Tattler (Heteroscelus brevipes), and Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria
   interpres) were common, and the Wood Sandpiper (Tringa glareola), Common
   Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos), Wandering Tattler (Heteroscelus
   interpres), Rufous-necked Stint (Calidris ruficollis), and Mongolian
   Plover (Charadrius mongolus) were uncommon migrants and winter visitors.
   A greater number and variety of shorebirds were seen during autumnal
   migration, which coincides with flooding of seasonal wetlands and higher
   shorebird populations, than during spring migration. The rarity of
   certain species, radar studies, and comparison with studies elsewhere in
   the region, support the hypothesis that some species normally migrate
   non-stop between Asia and Australia. The archipelago is not a major
   wintering or stopover area, but shorebirds make up a large portion of
   the avifauna of the islands. Inter-tidal foraging areas are very limited
   in the Marianas and the most important sites are threatened by
   development and human activity.}},

Abstract = {{From 1993-1995, we captured Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis)
   and searched for their nests in southern Quebec. All rails were caught
   at night, when males call constantly, by attracting birds with imitated
   calls (waiting) or by approaching birds and immobilizing them with a
   powerful beam of light (approaching). We were successful 183 times,
   capturing and recapturing 111 individuals. Most captures (66.6\%) were
   made bg waiting, 9.3\% by approaching, and 24.0\% by approaching after
   an unsuccessful attempt by waiting. Capture success tvas higher when we
   combined waiting and approaching than when we used either waiting or
   approaching alone. In 1994-1995, capture success was 24\% higher when we
   used the combination technique, compared to attempts made with the
   waiting technique alone. We captured 81.6\% of rails in those years and
   up to seven in a single night. The combination of waiting and
   approaching was more effective in 1994-1995 than in 1993 (chi(2)=7.20; P
   <0.01), possibly owing to experience acquired in 1993 and to a larger
   net being used the last two years. In 1994-1995, waiting was more
   effective on rails captured for the first time than on rails previously
   captured (chi(2)=7.66: P <0.01), probably because birds previously
   caught are warier. We searched for nests with the help of a German
   short-haired pointer and a French pointer. In 1994, they searched for
   18.5 and 7.8 h, respectively, and in 1995 the German short-haired
   searched for 8.8 h. Only the German short-haired pointer found nests,
   three in 3 h in 1994 and two in 2.5 h in 1995. We believe the
   effectiveness of this type of search depends on the dog's abilities and
   training, the dog's handler and probably weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the effects of radio transmitters on behavior,
   particularly of small passerines. Only recently have transmitters been
   made small enough for use on birds under 20 g. To determine if radio
   transmitters reduce activity levels, female Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia
   citrina) were fitted with transmitters while they were feeding
   nestlings. Females with transmitters and harnesses weighing 7-8.5\% of
   body mass did not feed nestlings less frequently than did control
   females. Males mated to females with transmitters did nor feed nestlings
   at different rates from males mated to control females. Brooding time
   and time spent perched on the edge of the nest did not differ
   significantly between tagged and control females. The finding that
   transmitters did nor affect an energetically demanding activity such as
   feeding young suggests that other aspects of female behavior also were
   not adversely affected.}},

Abstract = {{Few supplemental feeding experiments have been conducted on carnivores
   because of the difficulty involved in providing food to these species.
   We conducted a supplemental feeding experiment on the Northern Goshawk
   (Accipiter gentilis), an avian predator, in north-central New Mexico. To
   avoid attracting potential nocturnal predators of Northern Goshawk
   nestlings, we provided dead quail in a food box with a motorized cover
   that closed at night and opened the following morning. The box,
   constructed of rough lumber and simple hardware, was a reliable way to
   deliver food during the nestling period. Of 14 boxes, nine worked for
   the entire nestling period (approximately 4 wk), or until nest failure,
   four boxes became inoperable after being knocked over by black bears,
   and one box developed loose wires and no longer functioned by the end of
   the third week. We recommend the following food box design improvements:
   increased connection stability of box to post, heavier metal for cover
   and hinge arms, improved operating link connection to hinge arms, and a
   completely covered circuit board to minimize wire disconnection.}},

Abstract = {{During February and early March of 1995, Great Gull Island Project
   researchers surveyed the coasts of northern Argentina, Uruguay, and
   Brazil for wintering Roseate (Sterna dougallii) and Common (Sterna
   hirundo) Terns. We sighted both species on 6 March in a small flock off
   Alcobaca (17 degrees 33'S, 39 degrees 4'W) near Porto Seguro. This
   sighting of Roseates and the report of the recovery of a
   Great-Gull-Island-banded Roseate Tern at 18 degrees 00'S, 39 degrees
   30'W on 24 Jan. 1995 provide the southernmost wintering records of the
   species to date. At Punta Rasa, Argentina, we found an estimated 20,000
   to 30,000 Common Terns in early February. Although the species known
   range includes Argentina, this is the first report of such a large
   wintering concentration at this latitude. All color-banded Common Terns
   we saw in Argentina and southern Brazil, as well as all recovered banded
   birds from these areas, were over one year old. This suggests that older
   Common Terns occupy the more southern parts of the wintering range.
   Recoveries of Great Gull Island Common Terns from southern Brazil and
   Argentina made in April and May, and subsequently trapped on Great Gull
   Island, show that some birds make the >8000 km trip in 3 wk or less.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology of the Pied Water-Tyrant (Fluvicola
   pica) in a seasonally inundated savanna in the Ilanos of western
   Venezuela. A total of 123 nests was located in the wet season
   (June-October). The water-tyrant nested mainly in trees and shrubs near
   water in the early part of the wet season (86\%), but nested primarily
   in emergent marsh vegetation during the latter parr (84\%). The species
   was heavily parasitized (53\% of nests) by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus
   bonariensis). The rate of parasitism was nearly equal in both tree/shrub
   nests and marsh nests, and declined only late in the season. Parasitized
   nests were more frequently abandoned (60\%) than nonparasitized nests
   (30\%). The number of host eggs in nests was nearly equal in
   non-parasitized (2.42) and parasitized nests (2.51). The number of
   cowbird eggs (1.23) was less than the number of host eggs in parasitized
   nests. Of 37 non-parasitized clutches of the Pied Water-Tyrant, 18
   (49\%) produced nestlings and 7 (19\%) produced fledglings, and of 47
   parasitized clutches, 2 (4\%) produced nestlings and fledglings. Given
   the high level of parasitism on the Pied Water-Tyrant, it should be
   considered a major Shiny Cowbird host in the Ilanos of Venezuela. The
   Pied Water-Tyrant, however, does not appear to be an optimal host as
   only 3 of 47 parasitized nests in which the outcome was known
   successfully fledged cowbird young.}},

Abstract = {{Sources of mortality for adult hummingbirds are varied, hut most reports
   are of starvation and predation by vertebrates. This paper reports two
   potentially important sources of mortality for tropical hermit
   hummingbirds, entanglement in spider webs and impacts with windows.
   Three instances of hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornis spp.) tangled in
   webs of the spider Nephila clavipes in Costa Rica are reported. The
   placement of webs of these spiders in sites favored by hermit
   hummingbirds suggests that entanglement may occur regularly.
   Observations at buildings also suggest that traplining hermit
   hummingbirds may be more likely to die from striking windows than other
   hummingbirds. Window kills may need to be considered for studies of
   populations of hummingbirds located near buildings.}},

Abstract = {{The Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldlti) is one of the most
   endangered and least-studied species of penguins. Studies of its
   breeding ecology are needed to develop management plans for its
   conservation, and sex determination is essential to measure certain
   reproductive parameters. Humboldt Penguins, like other species of
   penguins, showed sexual size dimorphism, with males being heavier and
   larger than females. One discriminant function was derived from external
   measurements of 297 wild adult Humboldt Penguins of known sex (146
   females and 151 males) at Punta San Juan, Peru. The sex of 95\% of these
   birds could be correctly determined using the discriminant function D-1
   m=-38.98+/-3.16(WH)+3.69(BL) where WH is width of the head and BL is
   bill length. In addition, the sex of 91\% of the birds were correctly
   classified by means of the bill length using the univariate function
   D-2=-6.31+BL. In both equations, if D >0 the bird was classified as
   male, if D<0 it was a female, and if D=0, the sex could not be
   identified. The discriminant function D, was not accurate to sex a group
   of captive Humboldt Penguins (71\% successfully classified) because
   there were differences in size of the head between wild and captive
   birds. However, we obtained 83\% of cases successfully classified using
   the function D-2 as bill length was similar between wild and captive
   birds. The discriminant function may not be applicable to other wild and
   captive populations of Humboldt Penguins.}},

Abstract = {{The delta of the Rio Colorado was a very important area for water birds
   until early in the century after which damming and upstreams diversion
   caused significant habitat modifications in the area. Although recent
   information suggested the area was still important to many birds,
   detailed data on such use was lacking. Between the fall of 1993 and the
   summer of 1994 we made 14 surveys and two aerial flights over the area.
   The largest numbers of birds occured during the winter, when we counted
   over 100,000 birds. Shorebirds dominated the bird community, with
   Western Sandpipers accounting for the majority of the individuals. The
   areas most used by shorebirds were the extensive mudflats at the mouth
   of the delta. interior habitats were important mostly to herons and
   ducks.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted aerial surreys of Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens
   caerulescens) during autumn staging on the coastal plain of the Arctic
   National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northeast Alaska from late August
   through September, 1982-1993. We evaluated numbers and distribution of
   Snow Geese that staged on the ANWR, compared abundance of birds among
   5x5-km cells used frequently (5-8 yr), periodically (3-4 yr), or
   infrequently (1-2 yr), and examined distribution changes within Fears.
   Maximum numbers of Snow Geese observed annually were highly variable
   (range 12,828-309,225). Snow Goose flocks occurred across 605,000 ha of
   the coastal plain, but used some areas more frequently than others.
   Frequently used cells (38 of 363 cells in the study area) were
   non-randomly distributed and primarily occurred on the central coastal
   plain between the wet coastal and steep foothills regions. Abundance of
   geese was greatest in frequently used, intermediate in periodically
   used, and lowest in infrequently used cells. Within years, Snow Goose
   numbers and flock locations varied between surveys, possibly because
   geese moved to different foraging areas during staging. The widespread
   distribution and annual variability in numbers of Snow Geese on the
   coastal plain was likely because birds used foraging habitats that were
   spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The ANWR coastal plain is an
   important component of the fall-staging area used by Snow Geese that
   nest in the western Canadian Arctic. Management decisions that affect
   the region should reflect its value to migrating Snow Geese.}},

Abstract = {{We located two populations of endangered Aplomado Falcons
   (Falcofemmalis) in desert grasslands in north-central Mexico in 1992.
   During spring 1993, we quantified breeding success, habitat use, and
   prey selection by the easternmost population, which is located 40 km
   from the United States. We captured 17 individuals (one subadult male,
   seven adult males, three subadult females, six adult females) and placed
   tail-mounted radio transmitters on 15 of them. Females weighed 50\%
   more, had tails 9\% longer, and had wing chords 11\% longer than males.
   Breeding season ranges of six radio-tagged individuals monitored more
   than 100 d ranged from 3.3-21.4 km(2). Woody plant density ranged from
   11.2-139.5/ha and percentage of ground-cover ranged from 28.9-69.5\% in
   ten falcon territories. Six of seven nests were in yuccas (Yucca elata,
   Y. torreyi). Seven nesting pairs had a mean clutch size of 2.6, mean
   hatching success of 1.6, and a mean fledging success of 0.6. We
   identified 87 prey items from pellets, prey remains, and observed
   successful hunts; 82 were avian and 5 were insect. Meadowlarks
   (Sturnella spp.) were most abundant on potential prey transects and in
   the diet of Aplomado Falcons. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater),
   Greater Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) and hummingbirds
   (Trochilidae) were identified in diets, but were not detected on
   transects.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple, accurate method for quantifying the ectoparasite
   loads of live birds in the field. Birds were dusted with pyrethrin to
   irritate their ectoparasites, which were then dislodged from the plumage
   by ruffling the feathers over a collecting surface for repeated timed
   bouts until the point of diminishing returns was reached. This method
   required less equipment and was more accurate and efficient than
   previously described methods, as we show by comparing our method to
   other popular approaches. Dust-ruffling is best suited for sampling
   `'permanent'' ectoparasites, such as chewing lice (Insecta:
   Phthiraptera), which pass their entire life cycle on the body of the
   host.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{We examined the magnitude and timing of autumn migration for the
   Gray-cheeked/Bicknell's Thrush complex using banding data collected
   during 27 autumn seasons at Kiptopeke, Virginia. The average autumnal
   capture rate for the Gray-cheeked/Bicknell's thrush complex was 7.7 +/-
   8.9 (SD) birds/1000 net-h (range 0.5 to 36.4 birds/1000 net-h). For the
   27 years combined, 90\% of the captures occurred between 20 September
   and 15 October with an overall median capture date of 5 October.
   The timing of Gray-cheeked and Bicknell's thrush migration was compared
   for years where adequate morphological data were collected. All thrushes
   captured in these years were classified as Bicknell's, `'overlap
   thrush,'' or Gray-cheeked Thrush based on wing chord. The proportion of
   birds within each thrush category was relatively even for the selected
   years with average capture rates of 3.2 +/- 2.2 (SD), 4.3 +/- 3.8, and
   5.9 +/- 6.5 birds/1000 net-h for Bicknell's, overlap, and Gray-cheeked
   Thrushes respectively Median date of capture for the Bicknell's Thrush
   was statistically distinguishable from that of the Gray-cheeked Thrush
   in only one year (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Age ratios were
   highly skewed to hatching-year birds for all thrush groups. Data
   presented provide evidence of a relatively large move ment of Bicknell's
   and Gray-cheeked thrushes through coastal Virginia. Historic banding
   information from other locations may help to clarify the migration
   ecology of this species complex.}},

   During a 2-yr study examining the effect of rat predation on Bonin

   camera system that enabled us to view the contents of burrows, assess
   the status of the petrels' breeding activity, and search for evidence of
   rat predation. We successfully entered burrows and examined 65\% of all
   attempts. Nine percent of burrows encountered were either too long or
   contained sharp turns. The remaining 26\% contained rigid roots that
   prevented passage of the camera head. In addition to being small and
   inexpensive, the system limited disturbance to birds by using infrared
   lights and was easy for one person to carry and use efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition and population sizes of breeding birds changed
   substantially in less than 10 yr following local disturbances in a mixed
   deciduous forest plot in Itasca State Park, northern Minnesota. Dutch
   elm disease, drought, and windstorms changed a closed-canopy
   elm-birch-ash forest to a more open habitat dominated by basswood, ash,
   and standing snags with large areas of dense fern cover. Breeding bird
   censuses conducted in 1979-1981 and 1990-1992 showed substantial changes
   in local populations of several species including Ovenbirds (Seiurus
   aurocapillus) (20.0 territories/10 ha in 1979-1981 to 1.6 in 1990-1992),
   Veeries (Catharus fuscescens) (4.1 to 0.9), Mourning Warblers (Oporornis
   philadelphia) (0.7 to 5.5), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) (0.0 to
   6.4), and White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) (0.0 to 7.1).
   These changes were related to increased density of ground vegetation and
   increased light levels. Spatial distribution of species showing major
   increases was strongly associated with the locations of patches of dense
   undergrowth. Arboreal species showed less population change between
   census periods than did ground foragers. These local population changes
   were unrelated to trends over the same period on a 15-km roadside survey
   in the park. Changes in species abundance on the plot appear to be
   caused by local habitat change rather than broader-scale processes.}},

Abstract = {{We used time-at-depth recorders and radio transmitters to measure dive

   for partitioning time-at-depth profiles, obtained from individuals
   making U-shaped, flat-bottomed dives, into foraging time and travel time
   is presented, and a Fortran program to run the algorithm is provided.
   The deepest dive recorded was 61 m, but foraging depth parameters varied
   considerably between colonies and years. On average, European shags
   spent 47.6\% of their underwater time foraging. The duration of each
   stage of the dive cycle was a function of water depth. The observed
   trends were qualitatively similar to predictions of optimality models
   for air-breathing animals that feed underwater, but more data from
   individuals foraging at depths approaching the physiological maximum for
   the species are needed.}},

Abstract = {{A paucity of information on shorebird regional population sizes and
   numbers in particular wetlands has precluded quantitative assessment of
   the effect of wetland loss on shorebirds. To address this, Point Reyes
   Bird Observatory organized a broad survey to quantify the importance of
   specific wetlands to wintering and migratory shorebirds in western North
   America. In wetlands along the west coast of Baja California, Mexico,
   354,905 shorebirds were estimated present in winter based on ground and
   air surveys between January 1991 and January 1994. This compares to
   500,000-575,000 for coastal California wetlands during the winters of
   1990-1992. Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) made up 35.8\%, Marbled
   Godwits (Limosa fedoa) 25.4\%, dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.) 13.6\%,
   Dunlins (Calidris alpina) 11.0\%, Willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus)
   4.7\%, Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola) 3.7\%, and 20 other
   species each less than 1.0\% of the wintering shorebirds in the Baja
   California wetlands. The Laguna Ojo de Liebre/Guerrero Negro wetland
   complex held many more wintering shorebirds than any other Baja
   California site. When compared to other Pacific coast wetlands in the
   United States and Canada, it had the most wintering Marbled Godwits, was
   second (to San Francisco Bay) in total wintering shorebirds and Western
   Sandpipers, and was one of only three sites supporting several hundred
   wintering Red Knots (Calidris canutus). in comparison with coastal
   California, numbers of wintering American Avocets (Recurvirostra
   americana), Black-necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus), and Least
   Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) were relatively low in western Baja
   California.}},

Abstract = {{Descriptions of the nesting season of the Common Ground-Dove (Columbina
   passerina) exist for many states; however, most are based on only a few
   nest records collected over broad geographic areas. We characterize the
   nesting season at one locality in Florida based on numerous records
   accumulated from year-round intensive field work. We compared our
   results with results from records obtained elsewhere in Florida and from
   Texas, and with small samples of records from several other states.
   Ground-doves in south-central Florida nested from late February-early
   October, with more than 50\% of all clutches completed during a 44-d
   span from early April-mid-May. A slight increase in nesting occurred
   during late August-early September. Elsewhere in Florida, the nesting
   pattern was similar, but the peak was slightly longer and no second
   pulse was evident. Nesting began earlier and lasted longer in Florida
   than in Texas. Although of similar duration, peak nesting occurred 3-4
   wk earlier in Florida than in Texas. Many seed-eating doves have
   multiple broods; Common Ground-Doves eat tiny grass and weed seeds.
   Using one month as the average duration of one complete nesting cycle,
   the nesting season of Common Ground-Doves in Florida, Texas, and
   apparently other states could accommodate the fledging of three or four
   broods. Unfortunately, data on the reproductive performance of
   individual ground-doves remain lacking. The true number of nesting
   attempts remains unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting success of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) near Juneau,
   Alaska was compared for experimental nests (supplementally fed pink
   salmon {[}Oncorhynchus gorbuscha] for seven weeks) and control nests (no
   supplemental food) to determine if food limits reproductive success
   during the nestling period. Although supplemental food accounted for at
   least 50\% of the estimated nestling energy requirements, brood
   reduction and the number of nests failing post-hatch was small and
   differed little in experimental and control nests. Most active nests
   that failed were abandoned during incubation, which may be a critical
   phase determining nesting success of eagles nesting along the coast of
   southeastern Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the foraging ecology of wading birds in shallow-water
   mangrove swamps in southwestern Puerto Rico in 1994-1995. We needed
   reliable estimates of prey availability. Kushlan's (1981) 1-m(2)
   throw-trap is useful to obtain such estimates in various shallow-water
   habitats. However, its heavy, box-like frame made it difficult to work
   in our study area. Here, we describe a modification to and use of the
   throw-trap, evaluate its performance, and give an example of its
   application to wading bird foraging studies. The modified trap retained
   its basic sampling unit (i.e., 1-m(2)), but was lighter, easy to use,
   and suitable for sampling prey in areas of uneven bottom contours in a
   standardized fashion. We found that the correlation between estimates of
   prey abundance and number of successful foraging attempts by focal
   wading birds was significant (Spearman Rho = 0.34, P < 0.001),
   suggesting that data provided an estimate of prey availability. Thus,
   data collected with the modified trap were suitable to test whether
   patterns of prey availability influenced wading bird distribution. We
   found that the mean number of prey/m(2) in used sites (i.e., greater
   than or equal to two foraging birds) (131.28 +/- 16.53{[}SD]) was
   significantly higher;han random sites (26.28 +/- 6.66). Significant
   differences were also true when tests were conducted by individual prey
   items like Poecilia and Xiphocaris, important in the diet of wading
   birds in our study area.}},

Abstract = {{Dunlin (Calidris alpina) scanning and flocking behavior was studied in

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that crossbills (Loxia spp.) are opportunistic
   breeders that time the onset of their reproductive cycle based on food
   availability rather than photoperiod, as is the case in most other bird
   species. Crossbills are able to nest throughout most of the year at
   middle latitudes, but the reproductive biology of these birds at high
   latitudes remains poorly known. A total of 469 White-winged Crossbills
   (Loxia leucoptera) was caught in Fairbanks, Alaska during a 2.5-yr
   period. Based on the proportion of juvenile birds in the sampled
   population, the proportion of adult females with a brood patch, and
   seasonal changes in adult male cloacal protuberance size, it appears
   that interior Alaska White-winged Crossbills breed only in spring and
   early summer. Timing of reproduction of crossbills breeding at high
   latitudes may be limited by environmental factors (potentially, ambient
   temperature and/or photoperiod) rather than by food availability.}},

Abstract = {{We report an apparently unusually high incidence of leg injury in Willow
   Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) as a result of banding and color
   banding. Color bands and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) bands
   applied to Willow Flycatchers from 1988-1995 resulted in an overall leg
   injury rate of 9.6\% to birds returning to our study areas in subsequent
   Fears. Most injuries occurred on legs with only color band(s) (58.3\%)
   or on legs with both a USFWS band and a color band (35\%); only 6.7\% of
   injuries (4/60) were due to USFWS bands alone, yielding an overall USFWS
   band injury rate of only 0.6\%. Injuries ranged from severe (swollen,
   bleeding legs; a missing foot) to relatively minor (irritations on the
   tarsus). Amputation of the foot occurred in 33.9\% of the cases. Return
   rates of adult injured birds in the year(s) following injury were
   significantly lower than for the population at large.}},

Abstract = {{One hypothesis to explain both within- and between-season breeding
   dispersal is that individuals move in response to degradation in the
   suitability and/or quality of their nesting sites. This hypothesis was
   experimentally examined by manipulating the suitability and/or quality
   of nesting boxes used by Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) on one study
   site in upstate South Carolina. From 12 randomly assigned boxes, old
   nests, parasites, dead nestlings, old food or feces were not removed, as
   they were from 12 other randomly assigned boxes. There were 24 nesting
   attempts in cleaned boxes; 26 in not-cleaned boxes. Third brood nesting
   attempts occurred in only one of the cleaned boxes but in five of the
   not-cleaned boxes. Only 59\% of individuals stayed to breed again within
   the season in not-cleaned boxes, whereas 72\% stayed in cleaned boxes.
   Equal numbers of both males and females returned to breed in cleaned and
   not-cleaned boxes during the next breeding season, however. Both within-
   and between-season breeding dispersal is significantly more likely after
   unsuccessful nesting attempts than successful nesting attempts. There
   was no significant effect of cleaning or not cleaning nesting boxes on
   the chance of nesting attempts or the numbers of nestlings fledged from
   nesting boxes.}},

   variation. Migration date was independent of female age or physiological

Abstract = {{Ages of Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) chicks are sometimes
   estimated by comparing their wing lengths with a sample of known-aged
   chicks from the same colony. The technique is reliable if the rare of
   wing growth is unaffected by variation in nutrition. Recent studies
   suggest that wing growth may respond to food supply. I investigated
   variation in wing length in relation to chick age and mass during a
   period of reduced food availability. Wing length was correlated with
   mass at all chick ages, and wing growth over a 4-d interval was related
   to change in mass over the same interval at most ages. Variation in wing
   length and differences between estimated and actual ages increased with
   age. Average ages of chicks between 5-50-d old were estimated
   satisfactorily, but estimates for chicks growing faster or slower than
   average were biased. Measurements from a representative sample of
   contemporary, known-aged chicks are required to provide reliable,
   average age estimates. Large potential errors for individual chicks
   poses problems for studies investigating individual behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Mist-netters have reported a decline in the total number of birds
   captured (new captures and recaptures) per day over a period of
   intensive banding and have attributed this decline to `'net shyness.''
   If birds were net shy, then mark-recapture estimates of population size
   from mist-netted samples could be in error. Swinebroad (1964), however,
   reported that Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) were recaptured
   sooner than expected by chance, indicating that they were not net shy.
   Birds captured sooner than expected by chance, however, also would
   affect the results of mark-and-release estimates of population size. In
   exploring the problem further, I mist-netted birds on days separated by
   at least three days of human inactivity in the area of the nets. There
   was no tendency for the total number of Wood Thrushes captured to
   decline from one banding day to the next. Also, Wood Thrushes had a
   higher probability of being recaptured on the first banding-day after
   initial capture than they had of being recaptured on a day in the
   subsequent 3-d-period. I found no reliable evidence for a decline, much
   less net shyness.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands that are diked and managed may supplement declining
   natural habitat for migrating shorebirds (Charadriiformes). However,
   data on shorebird diet in these diked wetlands are scarce. We examined
   shorebird diet and prey size selection in brackish diked wetlands at the
   Yawkey Center on South Island, South Carolina, USA. Gut contents of
   seven Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) and seven Short-billed
   Dowitchers (Limnodromus griseus) were examined. The most common items ia
   gut contents were mandibles of the nereid polychaete, Laeonereis
   culveri, followed by insects. L. culveri eaten by Short-billed
   Dowitchers were significantly larger than those eaten by Lesser
   Yellowlegs. This difference may be related to differences in bill length
   and feeding tactics. We make suggestions on how to maintain high numbers
   of L. culveri in diked wetlands, but more research on the timing of
   colonization by invertebrates is needed in shorebird conservation
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Song rate in birds is known to be influenced by the social status and
   nutritional state of the male. However, studies examining the impact of
   management practices on the conservation of migratory species often use
   song rate techniques to census populations. We examined song rates in
   three species of forest birds in northwestern Virginia, and found that
   Wood Thrushes and Ovenbirds sang more often in blocks of continuous
   forest, while Northern Cardinals sang more often in forest patches.
   Individuals > 50 m from the observer sang more often than closer birds,
   and individuals in higher density populations sang more often than
   individuals at low density sites. The spatial variability in song rate
   was not severe enough to significantly change species-detection rates
   for 5-min song counts, but did significantly affect our population
   density estimates for those species. A key assumption of song count
   censuses, that all individuals of a species sing at comparable rates and
   thus have an equal probability of being detected, regardless of habitat
   structure, may not be valid.}},

   while the body temperature of incubating adult birds was 38.2 C. The
   body temperature-egg temperature difference (0.9 C) was the lowest

   by a diet of plant material (92.6\% and 96.9\%, respectively). While

Abstract = {{Periodic monitoring of breeding Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) at a
   large colony in central Spain was conducted to estimate survey accuracy.
   Detection of breeding Griffon Vultures varied in relation to the number
   of visits to the colony. Single visits resulted in low percentages of
   pairs being detected. At least four complete surveys conducted between
   January and March were necessary to detect most pairs. Estimated
   productivity of the colony decreased with an increasing number of
   surveys. An accurate estimate of productivity was only obtained with
   four surveys conducted prior to April. Other possible combinations of
   survey dates overestimated productivity. Estimates of the age structure
   of the colony improved with the frequency of visits because the number
   of known-aged vultures increased during the season. The proportion of
   breeding adults in the colony decreased until the end of March and then
   increased slightly because subadults vultures started breeding later
   than adults, and suffered a higher breeding failure than adults.
   Accurate surveys of breeding Griffon Vultures depend on multiple and
   time-standarized surveys as opposed to single and unstandardized counts.
   The best option is multiple survey dates centered around the late
   February peak in nesting activity.}},

Abstract = {{Molt-data from museum specimens of Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea) were
   analyzed and considered in relation to other life-history aspects.
   Differences in shape and color of outer tail feathers were reliable
   indicators of age class, allowing second-year birds to be distinguished
   from third-year birds, and second- and third-year birds from
   after-third-year birds. No differences in molt pattern were found
   between subadult age classes, or between subadult and adult age classes.
   The duration of primary molt was estimated at 99 d for adults and 221 d
   for subadults. This difference in time allotted to molt probably results
   from constraints imposed on adults by migration and breeding. Adults
   replace all their flight feathers on the wintering grounds, whereas
   subadults often complete this molt in tropical latitudes where they
   summer. Arctic Terns appear to exhibit the second inner primary molt
   featured by most other Sterna species.}},

Abstract = {{Densities of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in the southern
   Appalachians are lower than in more northerly portions of the species'
   range. One explanation is that highly dispersed winter food resources in
   the southern Appalachians cause southern Ruffed Grouse to spend a larger
   portion of each day active. More activity could increase mortality by
   increasing predation risks and energy expenditure. Radio-tagged Ruffed
   Grouse in Virginia were active an average of greater than or equal to 5
   h/d during the winter. This level of activity is greater than that
   reported for Ruffed Grouse and other grouse species during winter.
   Ruffed Grouse in more northerly portions of the range may be able to
   meet their energy requirements in less than half the time required for
   grouse in the southern Appalachians. Ruffed Grouse in Virginia were not
   strongly crepuscular as are most other grouse species, The high activity
   levels of Ruffed Grouse observed during the winter in Virginia are
   consistant with the hypothesis that low food availability in the
   Southeast results in increased time spent foraging.}},

Title = {{Estimation of arthropods available to birds: Effect of trapping
   technique, prey distribution, and bird diet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{426-442}},
Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{Few studies have attempted to measure food available to insectivorous
   birds. One reason for this is the difficulty of sampling potential prey
   adequately. In this paper, we present a simple mathematical approach to
   estimate seasonal availability of arthropods by considering both the
   differential probability of each taxon being sampled with a trapping
   technique and being preyed upon by a bird. Because our index is based on
   the summation of the percent abundance (relative to the whole sampling
   period) of each arthropod taxon in a sample, abundance of prey taxa
   collected with different trapping methods or even different food types
   (e.g., arthropods, seeds, fruits) can easily be combined. These values
   are further multiplied by the importance of each food taxon in the
   birds' diet, resulting in a weighted abundance index. Unlike other
   methods to estimate arthropod availability, this approach is readily
   applicable to community or long-term studies and offers flexibility in
   its use. We provide three applications of our index, each one in a
   different Neotropical habitat (thorn scrub, mangrove woodland, humid
   forest) where arthropod abundance and bird diet were monitored during a
   year. Regardless of the habitat type, the trapping technique used, and
   the bird species considered, our original data on arthropod numbers were
   importantly and unpredictably modified by our index. Using diet data to
   weight arthropod abundance had a strong impact on our estimates,
   suggesting that sampling of arthropods in the bird's foraging
   microhabitat might not be sufficient to assess food abundance to a
   particular species. Breeding of resident species as well as abundance
   pattern of migrant species at our study sites were better related to our
   weighted abundance index than to numbers of arthropods sampled with any
   trapping technique, suggesting that this method provides a reliable
   estimate of food availability. Selection of an appropriate trapping
   technique, level of prey identification, and biases associated with diet
   estimation from gut contents are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of herbicide-induced changes in wetland vegetation (largely
   cattails, Typha spp.) on densities of American Coots (Fulica americana)
   and Soras (Porzana carolina) were assessed in northeastern North Dakota.
   In 1990 and 1991, 17 cattail-dominated wetlands were randomly assigned
   to 0\% (reference wetlands), 50\%, 70\%, or 90\% spray coverages with
   glyphosate-based herbicide. American Coot densities were lower in the
   reference wetlands than in the glyphosate-treated wetlands during one (P
   = 0.09) and two years post-treatment (P = 0.04). Numbers of American
   Coots were positively correlated with coverages of water and dead
   vegetation, but were negatively correlated with coverage of live
   vegetation (Ps < 0.1). One year post-treatment, reference wetlands
   harbored more Soras than did the treated wetlands (P = 0.08) but Sora
   numbers were similar among treatments two years post-treatment. Sora
   numbers were positively correlated with coverage of live vegetation (P <
   0.1). Our results suggest that managers should strive to create a mosiac
   of open water, live emergent vegetation, and floating mars of dead
   vegetation to maximize wetland use by American Coot and Sora
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a
   low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to
   the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers
   require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response
   of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included
   construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and
   removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality.
   Translocations of Red-cockaded `Woodpeckers from on-site and donor
   populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the
   overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic
   consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out
   54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304
   southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor).
   Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of
   breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall
   population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly
   focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been
   successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of
   endangered birds.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the utility of feathers and egg shell membranes, deposited
   in the nests of Spectacled Elders (Somateria fischeri), as a source of
   DNA for genetic studies at both the population and individual level. The
   potential for feather DNA contamination as a result of female behavioral
   interactions (e.g. nest parasitism), reuse of nest sites from previous
   years, or other unknown occurrences was acknowledged and specifically
   tested. DNA was successfully extracted from both feathers and egg shell
   membranes and waterfowl microsatellite loci were used to construct
   individual genotypes. We found no difference in the genotypes obtained
   from nest feathers or blood of the incubating female. Detection of nest
   feather contamination was possible with as little as one feather when
   samples from multiple females were intentionally mixed. Triplicate DNA
   extractions from 33 nests provided a means of detecting contamination in
   3 nests. Egg membranes proved a viable source of offspring DNA and can
   contribute valuable data to investigations of parentage when assayed
   jointly with maternal feather DNA. Nest materials provide an efficient,
   non-invasive method of genetic sampling that can be readily incorporated
   into field research. However, the natural history traits and mating
   strategies of a species must be considered during sample collection to
   identify the possible sources of nest materials (e.g., paternal,
   maternal, parasite, etc.). Specific experiments should also be designed
   to test sampling assumptions.}},

   migration timing of Northern juncos caught at Powdermill Nature Reserve
   in southwestern Pennsylvania. At a maximum, immature juncos replaced the
   lesser, median, greater secondary and carpal coverts, proximal and
   middle feathers of the alula, and proximal three secondaries (i.e.,
   tertials) during their first prebasic wing molt. There were no
   differences in average molt extent between the Pennsylvania and Southern
   samples, but juncos in both these samples molted significantly more
   feathers than Northern juncos. Modal pattern of wing molt in the
   Northern sample (lesser, median, greater secondary and carpal coverts)
   was approximately the minimum observed for the Pennsylvania and Southern
   samples. Within all three samples males accomplished slightly more molt
   than females, although the difference was not statistically significant
   for the Southern sample. Juncos in the Northern sample caught during the
   second half of the spring and fall migration seasons had molted
   significantly fewer feathers than juncos caught during the first half of
   those seasons. Because there was little or no relationship between
   relative hatching date (estimated from skull data) and molt extent or
   migration timing, we attribute the observed intraseasonal variation to
   geographical variation within the Northern sample. Within the
   latitudinal range represented by this sample, juncos from more northerly
   areas likely molt less and migrate through Powdermill later in both the
   spring and fall compared to juncos from farther south.}},

Abstract = {{During 1988-1990, 38 isolation-reared, color-marked, radio-tagged
   Greater Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis tabida) were released into the
   wild at the Seney National Wildlife Refuge (Seney NWR) to develop
   reintroduction techniques for Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). The
   objective of our study was to ascertain whether these puppet-reared
   cranes displayed normal behavior and to record details of nesting
   activity. During 1992 and 1993, 17 cranes (11 males, 6 females) were
   detected at Seney NWR or at more easterly sites in Michigan's Upper
   Peninsula. We were able to monitor sis male cranes; the others had
   non-functional radio transmitters. In 1992, all six were paired dth wild
   females, but none nested. In 1993 four pairs nested, all in palustrine
   habitat dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and cattails (Typha spp.). Two
   nests had two eggs each and one nest had one egg. The fourth nest
   flooded and no eggs were present when it was checked. Two chicks hatched
   on 24 May, one on 14 June. Sane survived past I wk. Sex of incubating
   cranes was known for 360 h of observation made between 0600-2200 h, 55
   Apr.-13 Jun. 1993, Males incubated for 239 h (66\%) of the total
   samples, females for 121 h (33.4\%), Males incubated mostly (77.7\%)
   between 0900-1800 h, females mostly in early morning (0600-0900 h) and
   late afternoon (1900-2200 h). We conclude that, unlike cranes reared tn
   the cross-fostering technique, isolation-reared male cranes exhibited
   normal reproductive behavior. The reproductive behavior of
   isolation-reared female cranes also must be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{I used high-frequency surveillance radar to estimate the numbers of
   Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) entering two watersheds on
   Vancouver Island, British Columbia. An accurate census was possible
   where incoming birds were funnelled through a narrow inlet
   (Bedwell-Ursus watershed), but counts were less reliable on more open
   coastline (Carmanah Valley). An estimated minimum of 900 and 100
   murrelets, respectively, entered these watersheds at dawn in June 1995,
   Radar yielded 5-10 times more detections than human observers using the
   audio-visual Pacific Seabird Group (PSG) protocol. Radar revealed a
   concentrated influx of murrelets 35-60 min before sunrise, but the
   audio-visual surveys failed to detect this peak. Most audio-visual
   detections occurred later, from 35 min before to 90 min after sunrise,
   when the radar showed intensive circling and departure behavior. This
   implies that audio-visual surveys underestimate the number of active
   nesters and sample many murrelets that might be performing aerial
   displays rather than commuting to nests. The radar revealed considerable
   activity at dusk (43\% and 29\% of dawn detection rates at Carmanah and
   Bedwell, respectively), a period not normally sampled in the PSG
   protocol. Birds leaving the forest for the ocean flew faster (mean 119
   km/h) than incoming birds (74 km/h) or those circling over the forest
   (81 km/h).}},

   eggs and young can be easily removed for measurement, banding. or other
   scientific purposes, (2) debris and nesting material from other cavity

Abstract = {{Data from Illinois' Spring Bird Count was used to estimate long-term
   population trends of Henslow's Sparrows in Illinois and to examine if
   the Conservation Reserve Program has affected these trends. Spring Bird
   Count data suggest that Henslow's Sparrow populations in Illinois have
   declined significantly over the last 21 yr, with an estimated average
   rate of decline of 7.1\% per year between 1975-1995. These data
   corroborate analyses of other long-term data sets and provide additional
   support for the general impression that populations of this species have
   declined in many parts of its range. Analyses of the potential benefits
   of the Conservation Reserve Program for Henslow's Sparrows revealed that
   recent population trends (1987-1995) in counties with high enrollment in
   this program were significantly greater than trends in counties with
   little Conservation Reserve Program enrollment. Although these data
   suggest that the Conservation Reserve Program may have benefitted
   Henslow's Sparrows in Illinois, this benefit has been insufficient to
   offset long-term declines due to other factors. Other conservation
   actions, beyond those associated with efforts aimed at reauthorizing and
   improving the Conservation Reserve Program, will likely be needed to
   achieve adequate protection for this species.}},

Abstract = {{Several environmental factors affect hummingbirds' selection of sugar
   sources. Using a factorial test design that included several different
   sucrose concentrations, source heights, and test locations, we measured
   amounts of sugar solution that Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus)
   removed from small (10 mi) feeders placed in successional habitat around
   old-growth forest. Hummingbirds showed statistically significant
   preferences for increasing sucrose concentrations from 20\% up to, but
   not including 70\% sucrose (by mass-volume). Height significantly
   affected preference under nearly all conditions. Hummingbird usually
   preferred elevated sources over those near the ground. In some instances
   there were differences in preference between test locations, possibly
   because of differing numbers of hummingbirds visiting sucrose sources.}},

   not the second. Total seed biomass in CRP fields was highly variable,

Abstract = {{The Zenaida Dove (Zenaida aurita) is common and widely distributed in
   the three major life zones (dry, moist, wet) of Puerto Rico. The
   xerophytic forest of Guanica may be a kev habitat for the reproduction
   of Zenaida Doves in the dry zone. Point-counts (six 3-min stations) were
   conducted from 1986-1966 and nest-counts (46 0.1-ha strip-transects)
   from 1987-1992 to study the changes in the density ((D) over cap) of
   Zenaida Doves and their active nests in the xerophytic forest. From
   1987-1992, the mean a of Zenaida Doves was 4.83/ha and the mean (D) over
   cap of active nests was 1.66/ha. The mean (D) over cap of active nests
   was higher in areas dominated by semi-deciduous vegetation than in areas
   dominated by deciduous and thorn-scrub vegetation. Point-counts and
   strip-transects suggested a population decline from 1987-1992, with 1989
   having the lowest (D) over cap of Zenaida Doves and active nests. The
   rainfall of the first 6 mo of the year explained 72-80\% of the
   Variation in (D) over cap from point-counts and strip-transects from
   1987-1992. Point-counts suggested a significant population decline from
   1986-1996, with 1989 and 1995 haring the lowest counts of Zenaida Doves.
   The rainfall of the first 6 mo of the year explained a significant
   proportion (51\%) of the variation of point-counts from 1986-1996. To
   detect 10-25\% differences (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.80) in the annual
   mean (D) over cap of Zenaida Doves and their active nests, sampling 32
   3-min stations and 79 0.1-ha strip-transects monthly from April-June is
   recommended. These sample sizes are large enough to detect positive or
   negative trends of 10\% through linear regression analysis. The
   conservation and management of the xerophytic forest may be of critical
   importance for maintaining current population levels of Zenaida Doves in
   the dry zone of Puerto Rico.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding and natal dispersal of Loggerhead Shrikes in southeastern
   Alberta (n = 27) and southwestern Manitoba (n = 73) were analyzed for
   differences due to sex and age. Return rates in the year following
   banding were 3 of 249 (1.2\%) and 27 of 3716 (0.85\%) for juveniles and
   31 of 96 (32\%) and 22 of 140 (16\%) for adults in southeastern Alberta
   from 1992-1993 and southwestern Manitoba from 1987-1994, respectively.
   Adult males returned more frequently than females. Both study areas
   experienced high re-occupation of previous year's territories, largely
   by new adults. Breeding success was not a significant predictor of
   return. Differences in distance moved between encounters for adults
   versus nestlings was significant for intervals of 1 yr and greater than
   or equal to 1 yr in both study areas. Juveniles and adults dispersed a
   mean distance of 14.7 km and 2.7 km from previous encounter sites,
   respectively. Ninety-five percent of returning adults can be expected to
   be within 4.7 km of their previous year's nest site. Our results provide
   insights into assumptions incorporated in models of Loggerhead Shrike
   population dynamics. To take advantage of relatively low breeding
   dispersal we recommend that re-introductions be attempted with birds
   >1-yr old for which breeding has been facilitated in the release area.}},

Abstract = {{During the middle of the dry season (February/March), we performed
   low-altitude aerial strip-censuses to estimate densities of waterbirds
   in the Atlantic coastal wetlands of Nicaragua and Honduras (Miskito
   Coast and La Mosquitia, respectively), areas which are poorly known
   ornithologically. We found 12.9 and 5.5 waterbirds/km(2) in 294.6 and
   281.5 km(2) surveyed in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively. Great
   Egrets (Arden alba) were most common and widespread, representing 53\%
   (Nicaragua) and 46\% (Honduras) of the sightings. Wood Storks (Mycteria
   americana) and Egretta herons were the next two most abundant groups.
   Breeding colonies of Wood Storks, Roseate Spoonbills (Ajaia ajaja), and
   Great Egrets were found in both areas, most nests containing eggs and
   small chicks. We document a previously unrecorded population of Jabiru
   Storks (Jabiru mycteria) breeding in both areas, with densities of 0.05
   and 0.16 birds/km(2), respectively. The wetlands of both countries
   appear to support a large proportion of the breeding Jabirus in Central
   America and should be given high priority for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{We looked for patterns in egg mass in the Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis
   macularia) within and across clutches, and for heritability of egg
   dimensions. Measurements of egg length, width. and mass were collected
   for 6 yr. Females laid from 1-5 clutches in a year. Egg mass was
   measured for 343 eggs from 98 clutches of II females. Of these, laying
   sequence was known for 337 eggs. Mean egg mass was 9.5 g (SD = 0.64),
   length was 3.2 cm (SD = 0.10), and width was 2.4 cm (SD = 0.06) (n = 547
   for egg dimensions). We compared female mass to (1) mean egg mass of all
   clutches, (2) mean egg mass of first clutch, (3) summed egg mass of all
   clutches, (4) summed egg mass of first clutch, (5) summed egg mass of
   last clutch, and (6) number of clutches. we also compared mean egg mass
   with (7) laying date for first clutches, (8) clutch number, (9) laying
   order within a clutch, for all clutches, (10) laying order within first
   clutch, (11) female identity, and (12) egg length and width. In
   addition, we compared mean egg masses of females in their first year of
   laying with their second year for (13) all clutches combined, and for
   (14) first clutches only. Finally, we compared (15) mean egg mass of
   females to mean egg mass of their daughters. Only egg dimensions and
   female identity resulted in significant relationships to egg mass.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of radio transmitter attachment on foraging trip duration
   and reproductive success of breeding Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis
   antarctica) were studied on Seal Island, South Shetland Islands,
   Antarctica. Attachment of transmitters having a cross-sectional area
   0.9\% that of the penguin had no significant effect on foraging trip
   duration, nest visit duration or the number of foraging trips per nest
   per day. Adults equipped with transmitters had significantly lower chick
   survival rates than control animals, however. This difference resulted
   from a higher nest failure rare of transmitter-equipped adults. Most of
   these failures occurred in the early part of the guard period. The
   average number of chicks raised to the creche stage in successful nests
   was similar for control and transmitter-equipped animals. Thus, chick
   mortality occurred as a result of failure of the entire nest (i.e.,
   abandonment by the adults) rather than lowered chick survival in
   individual nests. Nests at which both members were equipped with
   transmitters failed at a higher rate than nests at which one member was
   equipped with a transmitter. The transmitters used in this study may be
   considered a maximum size to be used for foraging trip duration
   experiments of medium-sized penguins.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{10-16}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Thirty-seven percent of the European passerines for which there are
   records of polygyny also practice polyterritoriality to varying degrees,
   and most of the polyterritorial species are also long-distance migrants
   that spend rather brief periods of time in the breeding area. As
   polygyny has been recorded for at least 71 species of North American
   (north of Mexico) passerines and, as many of these are long-distance
   migrants, it seems reasonable to assume that some of these species also
   practice polyterritoriality. A search of the literature revealed that
   there are records of polyterritorial polygyny for 11 species in North
   America, and there is circumstantial evidence for its occurrence in
   several additional species. In spite of considerable effort to
   understand the functional significance of polyterritoriality especially
   for the Pied Flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, it is still not clear
   exactly how this behavior might facilitate a mated male's acquisition of
   additional mates. Neither deception of females (i.e., males hiding their
   mated status) nor avoidance of female-female aggression appear to be
   wholly satisfactory explanations for polyterritoriality. Some instances
   of unmated males being polyterritorial for brief periods are also noted.
   It is likely that careful study of individually marked populations of
   passerines, as well as non-passerines, would discover additional species
   that at least occasionally practice polyterritoriality.}},

   35.1\%. Highest chick mortality occurred during the first week after
   hatching. Increased chick mortality also occurred during molting of down
   feathers, and at the end of the rearing period. Predation, parental
   desertion or delays in feeding and starvation were the main causes of
   chick mortality. The growth rare of chick mass was similar in single and
   double broods, but second chicks attained a similar asymptotic mass if
   they survived the first 9 d after hatching.}},

Abstract = {{Three pairs of individually color-banded Choughs (Pyrrhocorax
   pyrrhocorax) were studied on the island of Islay during the 1992
   incubation and nestling periods (21 April-16 June), to investigate the
   effects of land management factors on adult feeding behavior. The
   behavior of individual birds was recorded at 1-min intervals. The land
   utilized by the birds was mapped by farm management unit (compartment)
   and the use of these, and of 10 biotopes, were recorded together with
   nine behavioral activities. A total of 15,128 1-min observations was
   collected on these birds. All three pairs showed distinct selection for
   grass pasture (either old or new grassland). Over 90\% of each pair's
   time was spent in food collection activity, and invertebrate sampling
   suggested that the birds were feeding mainly on soil-dwelling tipulid
   fly larvae (Diptera: Tipulidae). Analyses of compartment agricultural
   management characteristics data indicated that the small number of
   preferentially used compartments were those in which (1) management
   during June-September 1991 produced medium-high grass sward heights, and
   (2) management between January and May 1992 produced short, open swards.
   It is suggested that this combination of seasonal management encouraged
   high numbers of tipulid larvae in the soil during winter and spring and
   provided optimum foraging conditions for the birds both before and
   during the incubation and nestling periods. The implications of the
   findings for pasture management are discussed in relation to their
   potential to provide relatively simple agricultural management
   prescriptions to favor Choughs on Islay during the incubation and
   nestling periods.}},

Abstract = {{The expense of gathering location data on birds and other wildlife using
   traditional techniques often discourages observers from obtaining
   frequent samples. To automate the direction-finding (DF) task important
   in radiolocation, a prototype system based on a circular array of
   antennas with no moving parts is described. It can operate continuously
   and rapidly, recording bearings on multiple radio transmitters. Using
   fewer than 10 pulses of a radio transmitter, DF stations report
   bearings. Static DF accuracy in open country was comparable to reported
   accuracy of manual methods in various habitats; performance in
   worst-case, real-life tests with small transmitters on wild passerines
   in secondary growth was poorer. In static tests, habitat features near
   the transmitter proved to be important in measurements using `'dither.''
   Such low-maintenance devices have advantages, especially for continuous
   recordings, for simultaneous localization of many subjects, and when
   access to a site is difficult.}},

Abstract = {{A miniaturized version of the volumeter described by Szekely et al.
   (1994) was used to measure the volume of several hundred eggs from Welsh
   populations of the Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and to compare
   volumes so measured with those calculated from the eggs' dimensions
   using Hoyi's equation. As Szekely et al. (1994) discovered on a small
   sample of plover eggs, Hoyt's formula consistently overestimates egg
   volume, in the case of Pied Flycatcher eggs by about 2\%. The eggs of
   flycatchers that nest in central Wales are similar in size and shape to
   those reported for European and English populations of this species. Egg
   length (L), breadth (B), and volume (V) averaged 17.74 mm, 13.32 mm, and
   1.58 cm(3), respectively. The egg's elongation or shape index (L/B) was
   most often between 1.30 and 1.35. Volume can be measured directly (and
   easily) using a volumeter, but it can also be estimated, if necessary,
   at least in so far as Welsh birds are concerned, from the dimensions of
   the egg using the formula V = 0.1178 + 0.4637LB(2) or from the egg's
   volume coefficient of 0.500, in which case V = 0.500LB(2).}},

Abstract = {{During a demographic study of Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens)
   and Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) difficulties were
   encountered using standard mist-netting techniques in a flooded
   bottomland hardwood forest. Here a technique is presented for capturing
   individual birds by setting up a mist net within a boat. This technique
   was used to capture 14 birds when other techniques could not be used.
   Capture times were similar to those over dry land, and no birds were
   killed or injured using this net set-up. This modification of
   traditional mist-netting techniques allows single-species demographic
   work to be conducted in areas of high water}},

Abstract = {{Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) invaded the Great Lakes in the
   mid-1980s and quickly reached high densities. The objective of this
   study was to determine current consumption of zebra mussels by waterfowl
   in the Great Lakes region. Feeding Lesser Scaups (Aythya affinis),
   Greater Scaups (A. marila), Canvasbacks (A. valisineria), Redheads (A.
   americana), Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola) and Common Goldeneyes (B.
   clangula) were collected in western Lake Erie and in Lake St. Clair
   between fall and spring, 1992-1993 to determine food habits. All 10
   Redheads, 97\% of Lesser Scaups, 83\% of Goldeneyes, 60\% of Buffleheads
   and 9\% of Canvasbacks contained one or more zebra mussels in their
   upper gastrointestinal tracts. The aggregate percent of zebra mussels in
   the diet of Lesser Scaups was higher in Lake Erie (98.6\%) than in Lake
   St. Clair (54.4\%). Zebra mussels (aggregate percent) dominated the diet
   of Common Goldeneyes (79.2\%) but not in Buffleheads (23.5\%), Redheads
   (21\%) or Canvasbacks (9\%). Lesser Scaups from Lake Erie fed on larger
   zebra mussels ((x)over bar> = 10.7 +/- 0.66 mm SE) than did Lesser
   Scaups from Lake St. Clair (x = 4.4 +/- 0.22 mm). Lesser Scaups,
   Buffleheads and Common Goldeneyes from Lake Erie consumed zebra mussels

Pages = {{105-113}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal activities of paired (male and female together without
   offspring) Interior Canada Geese (Branta canadensis interior) were
   compared to those of parents (pairs with offspring) of the Mississippi
   valley Population (MVP) during fall through spring 1984-1985 and
   1985-1986. Activities of parents with different numbers of offspring
   also were compared. The dominant activities of geese were alert, resting
   and feeding behaviors, which together averaged greater than or equal to
   70\% of the diurnal period regardless of social class, habitat, year,
   season or location. For both males and females, parents spent more time
   alert than pairs during fall, winter and spring. Parental vigilance
   probably benefitted young by allowing them greater access to food.
   Generally, the costs of maintaining this parental vigilance were
   apparently spread across several activities so that time spent resting
   or feeding did not differ between parents and pairs. The only exception
   was for females at Union County Conservation Area (CA) in fall, when the
   behavioral cost of parental vigilance was less time feeding. Parent
   males with greater than or equal to 3 offspring rested less than those
   with only one offspring. In lake habitats, females with two offspring
   fed more than females with three offspring. It is suggested that for
   Interior Canada Geese, diurnal time constraints on parents during
   fall-spring have only minor influences on the evolution of optimal brood
   size when compared to constraints during the nesting season.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of nestling Eurasian Nuthatches (Sitta europaea) was studied in
   the Magadan region of northeastern Siberia in 1957-1990. The number of
   prey items in a load and mass of a load did not vary significantly among
   years and bloods. Mass of a load was positively related to the number of
   food items in a load. Plecoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and
   Arachnoidea comprised the majority of nestling food both in frequency
   (76.6\%) and in mass (83.2\%). Almost all food types varied among years,
   but only a few prey types varied significantly. Arachnoidea were
   represented in nestling diet most evenly among all pears of study
   Individual variation in food types among broods was low with only one or
   two prey types varying significantly during each pear. The seeds of the
   Japanese stone pine found in the diet of nestling nuthatches suggest
   that nuthatches could have been using caches made at least seven mo
   previously.}},

Abstract = {{Data are presented on the status of the vireos (Vireonidae) that occur
   in Louisiana. Based primarily on year-round surveys at coastal sites in
   southwestern Louisiana and censuses at an inland site in central
   Louisiana, data on timing of migration are presented for White-eyed
   (Vireo griseus), Solitary (V. solitarius), Yellow-throated (V.
   flavifrons), Philadelphia (V. philadelphicus), and Red-eyed (V.
   olivaceus) vireos. In general, migrant vireos in spring are much more
   common on the coast than inland, whereas the reverse is true in fall.
   Bell's Vireo (V. bellii) has been recorded in 12 times in southern
   Louisiana between 4 November and 22 January; this represents a
   substantial portion of all late fall/early winter records from eastern
   North America. No documented records exist of Yellow-throated Vireo from
   early November to early March for Louisiana, or probably elsewhere in
   the Gulf Coast region, despite numerous published sight records.
   Warbling Vireo (V. gilvus) has declined dramatically as a breeding
   species in Louisiana for unknown reasons; there have been almost no
   reports of breeding birds for three decades. Two specimens of the
   subspecies V. g. swainsonii from western North America have been
   collected in Louisiana, one of which is the first winter specimen of the
   species for eastern North America. One specimen of White-eyed Vireo from
   Louisiana is V. griseus micrus, this represents the first record of this
   taxon north of southern Texas. One of the three Louisiana specimen
   records for Bell's Vireo is of a subspecies (V. b. medius) from the
   southwestern USA and north-central Mexico. One specimen record of
   Solitary Vireo from Louisiana is a distinctive subspecies (V. s.
   plumbeus) from western North America. A specimen of Yellow-green Vireo
   (V. flavoviridis) from Louisiana evidently is just the second documented
   record for the eastern United States. Two of 12 Louisiana specimens of
   Black-whiskered Vireos (V. altiloquus) are of the nominate subspecies
   (from the Greater Antilles), for which there was only one previous
   record for the United States.}},

   (TLSA) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska were studied from 1987 to
   1992 using capture-mark-recapture techniques to determine origin, age
   and sex composition, return rates and site fidelity. Brant originated
   from 10 nesting colonies in Canada and Alaska. The captured birds were
   76\% adults and 57\% males. Ninety-one percent of known-age recaptures
   were <6-yr-old Fewer 1-yr-olds and more 2-yr-olds were present than
   expected. Sixty-one percent of adult females were failed breeders. Brant
   were not segregated by nesting colony on lakes in the TLSA, but those
   returning exhibited high site fidelity (Psi = 0.945) to the lake of
   initial capture. Recapture rates for Brant banded in the Teshekpuk area
   were greater (tau = 0.156) than for Brant banded at nesting colonies.
   Highest recapture rates (tau = 0.059) of Brant banded at nesting
   colonies were from those located closest to the molting area.}},

Abstract = {{During 3 winter seasons (1991-1994),we studied the distribution and
   abundance of birds in 3 habitat types of the Georgia Piedmont. Bird
   densities were calculated using data from 2160 variable circular-plot
   counts, 720 each in the interiors of the 3 habitats. Habitat variables
   were measured in 135 0.04-ha circles, 45 in each of the 3 habitats. The
   objective was to compare bird densities during winter in the Piedmont's
   fragmented mature pine forests and mature upland hardwood forests with
   those in planted pine plantations, a major replacement type. A total of
   49 species was detected: 44 in mature pines, 42 in mature upland
   hardwoods, and 32 in 20-30-yr old pine plantations. Twenty-nine species
   occurred across all habitats. Overall, density estimates were low and
   variability among counts was high; consequently, significant (P < 0.05)
   habitat preferences were found for only about 25\% of the species.
   Species richness (S) and diversity (H') were greatest (P < 0.05) in
   mature pines and lowest (P < 0.05) in planted pine plantations. Also,
   species evenness (E) was higher (P < 0.05) in mature pines and upland
   hardwoods than in planted pine plantations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of herbicide-induced changes in wetland emergent vegetation
   on densities of territorial male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius
   phoeniceus), Yellow-headed Blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus),
   and Marsh Wrens ( Cistothorus palustris) were assessed in northeastern
   North Dakota. In 1990 and 1991, 23 cattail-dominated wetlands were
   randomly assigned to 0\% (reference wetlands), 50\%, 70\%, or 90\% areal
   spray coverages with glyphosate herbicide. Two pears post-treatment,
   densities of redwings were higher in the reference wetlands ((x) over
   bar = 1.59 +/- 0.24 {[}SE]/ha) than in the 90\% treated wetlands ((x)
   over bar = 0.55 +/- 0.14/ha, P = 0.063). Yellowheads were more abundant
   in reference wetlands ((x) over bar = 3.80 +/- 0.83/ha) than in treated
   wetlands ((x) over bar = 2.05 +/- 0.40/ha, P = 0.061). Likewise, wrens
   were more abundant in reference wetlands ((x) over bar = 2.21 +/-
   0.27/ha) than in treated wetlands ((x) over bar = 0.66 +/- 0.13/ha, P =
   0.001). Percent coverage of live emergent vegetation (largely cattails,
   Typha spp.) was positively correlated with blackbird and wren numbers (P
   less than or equal to 0.1). Results of this study suggest that numbers
   of these three wetland-dwelling species were limited by altering cattail
   density. Staggering vegetation management treatments on large wetland
   complexes may help diversify the stages of cattail regeneration and
   provide heterogenous nesting and foraging habitat for these birds.}},

Abstract = {{Information on effects of clear-cutting and different methods of site
   preparation to regenerate bottomland hardwood forests on breeding bird
   densities is scarce. Therefore, a preliminary study was conducted of
   breeding bird density during spring-summer of 1975 on a greater than or
   equal to 50-yr-old bottomland hardwood forest and on three 4-5-yr-old
   hardwood regeneration areas, on the Delta National Forest, Mississippi.
   Following clear-cutting, the three sites were prepared for regeneration
   by either hand-injecting all residual trees with an herbicide, injecting
   most trees but leaving some desirable species, or by mechanically
   shearing all residual trees at ground level. Number of breeding species
   in the mature forest (n = 13) was similar to that in a 4-yr-old
   regeneration area that had been hand-injected (n = 10), and a 5-yr-old
   regeneration area that had been hand-injected but had residual trees (n
   = 12). A 4-yr-old regeneration area that had been mechanically sheared
   had only four breeding bird species. Indices of similarity of species
   composition, compared to the mature forest, were 59\% for hand-injected,
   56\% for hand-injected with residual trees, and 19\% for the sheared
   area. Indices for hand-injected and hand-injected with residual trees
   were similar (86\%) and were dissimilar to the sheared area, 21\% and
   20\%, respectively. Highest breeding bird densities (pairs/40 ha)
   occurred on the hand-injected with residual trees (239) and
   hand-injected (228) areas, followed by mature forest (172) and sheared
   (66) areas.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the diet of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) in the Snake
   River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwestern Idaho for
   14 breeding seasons. The diet included 89.2\% mammals by number and
   91.2\% by mass. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) were the most common prey
   overall, but montane voles (Microtus montanus), Peromyscus spp., Great
   Basin pocket mice (Perognathus parvus) and Townsend's pocket gophers
   (Thomomys towsendii) were most common at some collection sites.
   Estimated mean mass of prey was 44.5 g (range 20.5-82.6 g at individual
   nests), and food-niche breadth (dietary diversity estimated by 1/Sigma
   p(i)(2)) was 7.32 (range 1.55-6.85 at individual nests). Lower mean
   overlap in diet occurred between nests in the same year than between
   years at the same nest. Species of prey taken were significantly
   correlated with the general habitat types in which the nest was located.
   Diets of owls in areas of intensive agriculture overlapped little (42\%)
   with those in rangeland habitats.}},

   that can be used to mark Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis) and other
   large birds. Hundreds of unique combinations can be obtained by routing
   geometric patterns into the plastic band and by attaching a short,
   flexible colored tab to the band. Of 3788 Sported Owls that were
   re-observed in one or more years following initial banding, only four
   lost their color bands, an observed band loss rate of 0.1\%. Color bands
   are particularly effective on Spotted Owls because they are tame and can
   be closely approached during the day Color bands may nor be effective on
   owls that are difficult to approach or that cannot be easily observed
   during the day.}},

Abstract = {{Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) recover) plan guidelines were evaluated by
   examining habitat use of foraging RCWs on the D'Arbonne National
   Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana. During the non-breeding period, RCWs used
   the largest available live pines (greater than or equal to 17 m in
   height), in che oldest stands (mean age >72 yr), with the highest pine
   frequency (90-100\%), and lowest hardwood basal area (<1 m(2)/ha).
   Foraging in dense stands of large pines may allow RCWs to maximize
   available foraging surface and minimize travel time between foraging
   patches. During the breeding period, RCWs foraged on smaller pines in
   stands with a higher proportion of hardwoods. Thinning of selected
   stands to increase pine basal area and acquisition of an additional 347
   ha of upland pine habitat is recommended to meet recovery plan foraging
   habitat guidelines and to facilitate maintenance of this small isolated
   RCW population.}},

Abstract = {{We used morphological characteristics to determine the sex of California

   univariate and multivariate techniques, we evaluated sexual dimorphism
   in five external measurements taken from 614 California Gulls: bill
   length, bill depth, head-bill length, tarsus length, and body mass.
   Males were significantly larger than females for all measurements. The
   greatest difference between the sexes occurred in head-bill length, bill
   depth, and tarsus length. A multiple logistic regression model was used
   to assign individuals to a sex class. Sex could be accurately determined
   using only three variables: head-bill length, bill depth, and tarsus
   length. Using the logistic function generated from our initial sample,
   we obtained correct classification of sex in 99.2\% and 97.0\% of the
   gulls in two additional validation samples.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 1993-1995, we banded Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) in La Plata County, Colorado. Of 11 birds banded during
   their hatch year (HY) that returned the following year, 4 (36.4\%) had
   totally black underwing coverts, suggesting a complete first prebasic
   molt in these individuals. Additionally, all 11 known second-year (SY)
   males showed some pattern of medium to dark brown in their primaries:
   they were browner at the tips, browner at the tips with the innermost
   1-3 all brown, or all primaries were browner than the secondaries.
   Another 101 males has had retained light-gray juvenal feathers under the
   wing and could safely be assumed to be SY, all showed the same pattern
   of brown in the primaries. All 59 known after-second-year (ASY) males
   had black primaries that did not differ in darkness form the
   secondaries. We suggest that totally dark underwing coverts are not a
   reliable characteristic for distinguishing ASY for SY males as previous
   studies, suggested, at least in this population, if the underwing
   coverts are light gray, the individual can safely be assumed to be SY
   (or first year if before the second summer). However, if the underwing
   coverts are totally dark, the presence of brown in the primaries may be
   used to distinguish SY males.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of harness-style and abdominally implanted
   transmitters on survival of ducklings, survival of attending females
   during the brood-rearing period, and female return rates in Mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos). Eight-three females were captured on their nests
   in late incubation in eastern Saskatchewan during 1990-1993.
   Transmitters were attached with harnesses on 34 females and 49 females
   had transmitters surgically implanted into their abdominal cavity. There
   was no difference in duckling survival (P=0.22 from hatch-14 d, P=0.07
   for 15-30 d) or brood survival (one or more ducklings alive in brood; P
   >0.4) to 30 d after hatching between broods accompanied by females with
   harnesses or implants. Female survival during late incubation and
   brood-rearing was high in 1990-1992 when only one of 61 females was
   killed over the: 60-d period from the time of capture until the young
   fledged. Survival of brood-attending females was lower in 1993 when 5 of
   16 females were killed during the brood-rearing period. Adjusted return
   rates were lower (P <0.025) for females with harnesses (22.6\%) than
   those with implants (55\%). These findings provide further evidence of
   adverse effects of harness-style transmitters. Although implanted
   transmitters are recommended for use in studying reproductive ecology of
   waterfowl, better controls are needed before the effects of transmitters
   and attachment procedures can be fully evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic cleaning of nestboxes by researchers may benefit birds by
   reducing the numbers of ectoparasites in the nestboxes. If so, birds
   should prefer cleaned nestboxes to nestboxes containing old nest
   material. House Wrens (Troglodytes nedon), however, prefer nestboxes
   that contain old nests to nestboxes from which old nests have been
   removed. We compared levels of mite infestation in subsequent House Wren
   nests builts in nestboxes from which we removed old nests with levels in
   unmanipulated nestboxes that still contained old nests. Nests built in
   nestboxes containing old nests had similar numbers of mites to nests in
   nestboxes from which we removed old nests. As House Wrens at least
   partially, if not entirely, remove old nests from nestboxes prior to
   use, this result is not surprising. We propose that removal of old nests
   by House Wrens reduces initial mite population size. As a result,
   numbers of mites in subsequent nests built in unmanipulated nestboxes do
   not differs significantly from those in nestboxes cleaned by
   researchers.}},

Abstract = {{We described quantitatively 19 summer plumage characteristics and bill
   and foot pigmentation of 247 known-age Laughing Gulls (Larus atricilla)
   collected in New York during 1992-1994. There were not differences in
   characteristics measured for male and female Laughing Gulls. Ninety
   percent of 2-yr-old Laughing Gulls and 96\% of greater than or equal to
   3-yr-old birds had full hoods. Fifty-seven percent of 2-yr-old Laughing
   Gulls possessed at least partial tail bands in contrast to 4\% of
   3-yr-old and 0\% of greater than or equal to 4-yr-old gulls. Thus 2- and
   greater than or equal to 3-yr-old Laughing Gulls cannot be separated
   reliably by the presence or absence of a tail band. Pink pigmentation on
   the breast or abdomen occurred in 12\% of individuals and was unrelated
   to age. Using the presence of absence of a distinct black-and-gray
   interface on the distal portion of the fifth primary, we correctly
   classified 96\% of 245 2- and greater than or equal to 3-yr-old Laughing
   Gulls. Using this characteristic in combination with the length of
   distinct black pigmentation present on the proximal vane of the sixth
   primary, we correctly aged 98\% of 244 gulls. This technique and
   previously published plumage characteristics provide rapid and accurate
   classification of Laughing Gulls in summer plumage as <1, 1, 2, or
   greater than or equal to 3 yr of age.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the food and feeding ecology of Red Knots Calidris canutus
   rufa on an area of rocky flat, or restinga, near San Antonio Oeste in
   the northwest of Golfo San Matias, Provincia de Rio Negro, Argentina in
   March 1992. These Red Knots are on their way north, from `'wintering''
   areas in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile) to the arctic breeding
   grounds in Canada. Three waves, each containing 5000-12,000 Knots, moved
   through the area. On the restinga they fed on banks of the small mussel
   Brachidontes, rodrigezi, virtually the only prey taken. Variably sized
   (1-28 mm) Brachidontes, of which those between 5 and 20 mm were eaten
   (8-12 mm long mussels being positively selected), occurred in high
   biomass densities (23-117 g ash-free dry mass {[}AFDM]/m(2)). Due to its
   abundance, visibility ease of detachment, slender shell form, and
   relatively weak shell, Brachidontes appear very suitable prey for Red
   Knots. Red Knots produced about 0.42 droppings/min. On the basis of a
   biomass equivalent of the droppings of approximately 62 mg AFDM, for
   conditions of balance (shell mass in=shell mass out) the intake rate was
   estimated at 0.433 mg AFDM/s. Making a few more assumptions, this
   translated into a net intake rate of 2.81 W, which would allow for a far
   deposition rate of less than a gram of fat per day. Using more
   optimistic estimates of the various parameters in the energy budget
   model, a fat deposition rate of 5 g could be achieved. This is the order
   of magnitude predicted for Red Knots staging at San Antonio Oeste for
   6-8 d and refuelling for the 1700 km long flight to the next known major
   staging area in southern Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{We examined temporal variation in the diet of Blackcaps (Sylvia
   atricapilla) in relation to food availability in four olive orchards in
   southern Spain. Four components of the diet were considered: olive
   fruits, non-olive fruits, animal matter, and non-fruit plant matter. The
   pattern of temporal variation in diet among olive orchards. The temporal
   pattern of olive availability, which differed among olive orchards as a
   consequence of different crops, ripening phenologies, and harvesting
   processes, was the main factor determining temporal variation in diet.
   This emphasizes the strong dependence of Blackcaps on olive fruits in
   this habitat. Arthropods and non-fruit plant material (the latter
   including leaves, flowers, and seeds of weed species) were also
   frequently included in the diet. Other fruits were eaten infrequently.
   However, the number of fruit species per diet sample increased wherever
   other fruits were available (e.g., near hedges), suggesting that such
   sites contribute to diet diversification.}},

Abstract = {{Nest markers are used commonly to identify and mark locations of nests.
   However, they also may attract predators and increase nest predation. We
   tested the effect of plastic flagging on predation of artificial duck
   nests, during two consecutive 14-d period, along two 45-km segments of
   graveled road near Crandall, Manitoba, Canada. Estimates of daily
   mortality rates between flagged and unflagged nests did not differ, but
   the power of rejecting the null hypothesis was low. Daily mortality
   rates of nests were higher between day 0 and 8 than between day 8 and
   14. A flag-by-interval interaction was significant, indicating that
   flagged nests had a higher mortality rate than unflagged nests between
   day 8 and 14. Differential nest-site vulnerability may affect predation
   soon after nest construction, whereas flagging may increasingly
   influence predation as nests age. We recommend that nests not be market
   with flagging and that natural objects be used to aid in nest
   relocation.}},

Abstract = {{A large influx of Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus) occurred
   at Long Point, Ontario in the spring of 1962 (Hussell and Stamp 1965).
   Observations from 1960-1994 indicate that large spring migrations are
   infrequent at this site, and the 1962 influx was the largest in the
   35-yr period. Spring influxes of chickadees were related to irruptions
   occurring the preceding fall, but not all irruptions were followed by
   spring migrations. Although the large spring migration in 1962 occurred
   in an exceptionally warm spring, there is no evidence that the size of
   spring migrations was consistently related to spring temperature. The
   1962 influx is regarded as an unusual event, perhaps triggered by a
   combination of unusual (but largely unknown) circumstances. A large
   irruption of Boreal Chickadees (Parus hudsonicus) in the autumn of 1972
   can also be classified as an unusual event because it was unique in the
   35-yr record.}},

Abstract = {{Research on a population of threatened Audubon's Crested Caracaras in
   Florida necessitated capture of specific adults. Although caracaras
   readily feed on carrion, we could not reliably capture them using
   methods traditionally employed to capture avian scavengers. Despite
   capturing 15 sub-adult caracaras in a walk-in cage trap, we abandoned
   this method because it was non-selective and time-consuming, and because
   adults would not enter the trap. Other methods commonly used to capture
   raptors were unsuccessful at capturing caracaras. They would not
   approach closely bal-chatri traps, noose carpets, noosed posts, or
   ground snares. Because caracaras are territorial and act aggressively
   toward an intruding adult caracara near their active nest, we developed
   a successful capture method that exploits this behavior. This technique
   uses a Q-Net, similar to a large bow net, and a live lure caracara set
   in the nest stand. During 1993-1995, we captured 35 adult caracaras in
   30 different territories, for an overall success rate of 67\%. In five
   territories, both adults were captured simultaneously. Time to capture
   of a selected individual or pair ranged from 5-90 min, and the ratio of
   males to females captured was 1.33 to 1.}},

   of animal matter during egg production was substantially lower than
   reported in other studies of food habits of Redheads. The diet of
   Juvenile Redheads changed with age. Animal foods were nearly half of the

Abstract = {{Arrival dares, mean numbers, departure dates, and proportion of adult
   males differed for Common Mergansers (Mergus merganser) on Caballo
   Reservoir between winters of 1992-1993 and 1993-1994. Wintering Common
   Mergansers spent daylight hours leafing (58.6\%), sleeping (17.5\%),
   flying (5.7\%), preening (4.0\%), stretching (4.0\%) and swimming
   (3.8\%). Feeding accounted for <4\% of daily activity. Diet of Common
   Mergansers consisted solely of large gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum)
   during the first winter, but was predominantly threadfin shad (D.
   potenense) during the second winter. The change in diet was probably a
   result of most gizzard shad having grown too large to be eaten by Common
   Merganser by che second ranter. Fish caught in gill net samples during
   both winters were predominately gizzard shad. Other fish netted were:
   white bass (Morone chrysops), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), channel
   catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). we
   suggest that managers should promote consistent annual recruitment of
   shad to provide a reliable food source for wintering Common Mergansers.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of backpack radio transmitters on Prairie Falcon
   (Falco mexicanus) reproduction (percentage of occupied territories
   producing young and number of nestlings produced) over four years. In
   addition, we observed falcon aeries during brood-rearing to determine
   attendance at the nest and in the territory, prey delivery rates, and
   prey composition. We found no effect of radio tagging of Prairie Falcon
   productivity (nesting success and brood size) among years, although
   productivity varied significantly among years. The sex of the falcon
   tagged did not affect productivity. Radio-tagged members of pairs did
   not differ significantly from un-tagged members of pairs in territory
   attendance, nest attendance, prey delivery rates, or caching rates.
   Nestlings raised by radio-tagged parents attained masses similar to
   those reared by control parents. During low prey years, radio-tagged
   males brought a greater proportion of small birds and reptiles, and
   fewer mammals to the nest area than control males.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to characterize the foraging habitat of the Mourning Dove
   (Zenaida macroura) by conducting an experiment to determine preferred
   habitat structure in grassland communities independent of species
   composition or forage availability. Our manipulations altered grass
   height, density of grass cover, and coverage of litter. To attract
   doves, food was added in equal amounts to all plots. We found that doves
   foraged in manipulated sites significantly more often than in
   Conservation Reserve Program control sires with an unaltered habitat
   structure. We concluded that on our study sites doves selected foraging
   habitat based on grass height and density. Our results suggest that the
   conversion of wheat fields to grass that has occurred extensively in our
   study area has resulted in a structural change in habitat that renders
   it less preferable for foraging by doves.}},

Abstract = {{Intersexual vocal communication in Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius
   phoeniceus) was investigated in this study. Females gave two basic
   vocalizations that either overlapped or followed their mates' songs in
   time. As males got farther from the center of the territory, females
   tended to shift from answering with type-1 songs to answering with
   type-2 songs and from overlapping to following male songs. As the
   distance between singing males and their mates increased, the incidence
   of answering decreased, and the answers shifted from type-1 to type-2
   songs and from overlapping to following. Finally, as the orientation of
   singing males relative to females changed from facing toward the females
   to facing away, the incidence of answering decreased, and female answers
   shifted from type-1 to type-2. These findings indicate that intersexual
   vocal communication in redwings is affected by the spatial association
   of the male with the female and with the territory.}},

   sonagraphic analysis to assess individuality in voice. All males were
   recorded several times on at least three different nights. The mean
   frequency of the sustained component of an individual's calls was highly
   distinctive only two owls shared a similar mean call frequency.
   Internote interval and note length were not as individually distinctive;
   although these features varied significantly among males, there was as
   much or more variation among nights for the same male. I suggest that

Abstract = {{We quantified the vegetation on 0.04-ha circles around 93 nests from 12
   forest-dwelling neotropical migrants to determine whether the structure
   of the vegetation influenced the probability of parasitism. Forty-five
   nests were parasitized by Brown-headed Cow-birds (Molothrus ater) and 48
   were not parasitized. Nests were located within deciduous woods in
   south-central Wisconsin. We compared 16 variables including percent
   cover at varying heights, densities of shrubs and trees, and number of
   dead trees (snags). For all species combined, nests parasitized by
   cowbirds were characterized by a more open sub-canopy (percent cover
   3-10 m) and canopy (percent cover > 10 m) and more ground cover (percent
   cover 0-0.5 m). Associated with these differences were a higher density
   of small shrubs and saplings (0.5-1 m) and a lower density of tall
   shrubs (>5 m) and small trees (7-14.5 cm DBH). Proximity of the nest to
   a snag did not increase the risk of parasitism. We speculate that the
   differences in vegetative structure around parasitized and
   non-parasitized nests were due primarily to differences in the host
   species composition between the two groups and resulted from cowbird
   nest-searching strategies and densities of host nests. For Acadian
   Fly-catchers (Empidonax virescens), the only species for which we had a
   sufficient sample size to make a within-species comparison, parasitized
   nests were associated with a more open canopy than non-parasitized
   nests. None of the other vegetative variables measured differed between
   the two groups. Our results suggest that species nesting within small
   forest openings may be particularly vulnerable to cowbird parasitism.
   However, for a variety of reasons, we do not recommend management at a
   micro-habitat scale. Instead, we recommend that managers minimize the
   risk of parasitism through landscape-level management where large areas
   of contiguous forest are maintained.}},

   was used to photograph nest predation events. This system may be die
   most versatile yet described in the literature because of its
   simplicity; portability, and dependability. The system was very reliable
   because it was designed around a high quality, all-electronic camera. It
   was an inexpensive alternative (about US \$110) to the few other
   commercially available photographic systems that offered similar
   features, and was the first system to provide these features in a
   compact, highly portable, and easily concealed field unit. Under all
   held conditions, in all seasons, day and night, the system consistently
   produced clear photographs of animals visiting artificial nests and
   scent-stations. This system was simple to operate because there was only
   one moving part, making malfunctions rare and easy to identify and fix.}},

Abstract = {{We measured productivity of the Spruce Grouse (Dendragapus canadensis
   canadensis) in patchy black spruce (Picea mariana) habitat along the
   southeastern limit of its range in mid-coastal Maine. We captured grouse
   and attached necklace-mounted radio transmitters to hens prior to
   nesting. Of 19 females monitored, only 26\% raised chicks to the late
   brood-rearing period. Predation was high on hens (37\%) and five were
   killed before hatching eggs. Six (55\%) entire broods were lost and only
   30\% of chicks survived to late summer. Production (No. of
   chicks/female), an index of productivity was <1 and lower in Maine and
   Minnesota study areas in black spruce than areas dominated by jack pine
   (Pinus banksiana) or a mixture of jack pine and spruce with dense
   undergrowth. Where Spruce Grouse breed in patchy black spruce
   communities, immigration from neighboring populations or inter-patch
   movement by local individuals may be required to maintain viable
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{We present criteria for sexing and aging non-breeding Choughs
   (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) based on nine years of capture-recapture data.
   Shape of the rectrices, intensity of plumage colour and iridescent
   brightness, and the contrast between old flight feathers and Freshly
   molted ones allowed us to distinguish three age classes (first-year,
   second-year, and after-second-year). For sex determination we selected
   morphological characters that (1) were independent of breeding status
   and (2) did not change with age. Tarsus length and bill width,
   repeteable measurements in both sexes, met both of these criteria. A
   discriminant analysis performed with these variables from breeding
   adults of known sex predicted with an accuracy of 100\% the sex of
   non-breeding Choughs that were subsequently captured as breeding adults
   of known sex. This methodology may be applicable to other species with
   delayed maturation where monomorphic plumage precludes discrimination of
   age and sex.}},

Abstract = {{The brood-parasitic Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) parasitizes
   more than 200 species of birds throughout its range, many of which are
   small passerines. Growth rates of cowbird nestlings are expected to vary
   according to factors such as host size, total number of young in the
   nest, and rates of food delivery by the host. Here I report growth and
   provisioning rates of cowbird and host nestlings in House Wren
   (Troglodytes aedon) nests in the Cauca Valley, Colombia. Cowbirds raised
   singly in wren nests had high growth rates and a short nestling period.
   Their mass increased 10-12 fold, reaching an asymptote at age 9-10 d and
   fledging at 12-14 d of age. Cowbirds fledged at 65-75\% of adult mass
   and remained small until their first mold, after which they reached
   adult mass. Being raised in mixed broods with wrens did not affect
   growth rates of cowbirds. Wrens,in contrast, increased in mass 10-fold
   and reached asymptotic mass, equal to adult mass, at the age of 10-11 d.
   They remained in the nest for an additional 7-8 d before fledging. At
   the 10 d of age, mass of wrens in parasitized nests was significantly
   lower than in unparasitized nests. The mass and provisioning rates of a
   single cowbird were equivalent to those of a modal brood of three wrens.
   The combination of rapid growth and early fledging resulted ina short
   nestling period for cowbirds, which together with a short incubation
   period, form part of a suite of adaptations that allow cowbirds to
   outcompete their foster nestmates.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1992 we placed wire-mesh exclosures around 13 of 52
   Pectoral Sandpiper (Calidris melanotos) nests near Oliktok Point on the
   North Slope of Alaska. Exclosures were 66-69 cm in diameter, 31-cm tall,
   and were made of 5 x 10-cm mesh weld-wire with 3-cm mesh chicken wire
   tops. The 5 x 10-cm mesh size allowed females to enter and exit an
   exclosure easily, and design of the exclosure provided sufficient
   anchoring to prevent Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) from digging under or
   raising exclosures. Daily survival rate of protected nests (0.982) was
   significantly greater than that of unprotected nests (0.717). In
   considering the daily survival rates of protected and unprotected nests,
   the behavioral responses of Pectoral Sandpipers to exclosures, and the
   fact that no protected nests were depredated, we conclude that this
   exclosure was effective under our study conditions. We offer specific
   considerations for designing exclosures and suggest that exclosures
   similar to the one we descibe may be used to protect other shorebird

Abstract = {{Although lean migrants are more likely to be recaptured than fatter ones
   at many stopover sites, the effects of mass loss on the probability of
   recapture have not been investigated experimentally. During fall
   mist-netting on Appledore Island, Maine, when two Northern Waterthrushes
   (Seiurus noveboracensis) or American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla)
   were captured simultaneously they were divided randomly into control and
   experimental categories. In the spring, pairs of American Redstarts or
   Magnolia Warblers (Dendroica magnolia) were treated similarly.
   Experimental individuals were held without food for up to 6 h before
   release to investigate the effects of mass loss on the probability of
   recapture, while control birds were banded and immediately released.
   Experimental birds significantly decreased in mass during holding.
   During the fail, experimental individuals were more likely to be
   recaptured at least 1 d after initial capture than control individuals.
   However, during the spring, I did nor find a difference in recaptures
   between control and experimental categories, although recapture rates
   were quite low. These results indicate that mass loss, either directly
   or as a result of lost foraging time, does lead to extended stopover by
   migrants during the fall. However, differences in priorities apparently
   exist between spring and fall migration. During the spring, mass loss
   may not lead to extended stopovers if migrants have enough energy to
   continue migration, especially when migrants are close to their final
   destination.}},

Abstract = {{From 12 Jan.-9 Apr. 1993, 25 Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) were captured, fitted with radio-telemetry transmitters, and
   monitored to determine night-roost fidelity and movements in the Delta
   Region of Mississippi. Transmitter-equipped cormorants were located at
   15 different roost sites during the study. The mean number of roosts
   used by cormorants was 2.08 +/- 0.172 SE. The mean number of
   transmitter-equipped cormorants located each week was 8.25 +/- 0.87 SE.
   The distances moved by cormorants among night roosts ranged from 0-398
   km. In the eastern part of the Delta Region two studies were conducted
   concurrently with this telemetry study to determine if repeated
   harassment of roosting cormorants using pyrotechnics would cause
   cormorants to abandon selected roosts and nearby aquaculture facilities.
   Dispersed roosts were repeatedly harassed with pyrotechnics in the
   eastern part of the Delta Region and non-dispersed roosts in the western
   part of the Delta Region were not harassed. There was no significant
   difference in cormorant movement to more than one roost after
   transmitter attachment between birds captured in dispersed roosts versus
   non-dispersed roosts. Three transmitter-equipped cormorants were located
   on the Gulf coast approximately 390 km from the study area. One
   subsequently moved back to the study area These observations provide
   evidence that in Mississippi wintering populations of cormorants show no
   strong fidelity to a primary roost, but shift throughout the Delta
   Region and to the Gulf coast.}},

   the attractiveness of boxes to House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) in a
   Wyoming, USA, population. Over 2 yr, 59 pairs of wrens were given a
   choice between two boxes mounted <2 m apart. One box contained an old
   wren nest, the other box was empty Wrens showed no preference for either
   type of nest box; 32 (54\%) and 27 (46\%) pairs used boxes with and
   without old nests, respectively. Wrens did, however, avoid re-using old
   nests if these nests were heavily soiled. Pairs that chose boxes with
   and without old nests spent equal amounts of time in nest preparation
   and did not differ significantly in reproductive output. Young raised in
   boxes that had contained old nests did not experience higher loads of
   ectoparasitic blow fly (P. parorum) larvae, probably because blow flies,
   unlike other types of nestling ectoparasites, do not overwinter in

Abstract = {{Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) nesting habitat was studied to make
   management recommendations for fields enrolled in a federal land
   retirement program. We compared available microhabitat, nest-site
   selection, and nest success on rangelands and Conservation Reserve
   Program (CRP) fields in eastern Kansas. Daily nest survival rates and
   numbers fledged per female did not differ significantly between land-use
   types, but the power of these tests was low. Predation was the primary
   source of nest failure throughout incubation, hatching, and nestling
   stages; abandonment, trampling, inviability, and unknown causes also
   were important during incubation. Mowing CRP fields was a source of nest
   failure and also induced adults to abandon some fields. CRP fields had a
   significantly higher percent, depth, and density of litter cover; a
   taller herbaceous canopy; less herbaceous cover; and more standing dead
   cover than rangelands. Differences in habitat structure indicate that
   CRP has increased the diversity of available nesting habitats. Eastern
   Meadowlarks selected nest sites with significantly greater litter cover,
   higher proportion of grass, more uncompacted litter, and more structural
   homogeneity than available on random plots. Delay of mowing and
   prescribed burning are recommended to enhance and maintain habitat
   suitability for nesting Eastern Meadowlarks in CRP fields.}},

Abstract = {{The number of Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus) migrating past
   Cape May, New Jersey and other coastal localities has shown a sharp
   decline since the mid-1980s. This decline may reflect a population
   decrease or could result from an increase in individuals remaining to
   winter in New England. To test this possibility, 18 yr of New England
   Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs) for Sharp-shinned Hawks were analyzed using
   linear and multiple regressions, and factorial analysis of variance. New
   England was divided into eight geographic blocks, and two CBCs per block
   were randomly selected from those in existence since at least 1975.
   After adjusting for observer effort, counts were found to be
   significantly correlated with year, latitude, and longitude. Overall
   from 1975-1992, Sharp-shinned Hawks wintering in New England increased
   by more than 500\%. Increases were strongest for the southern and

Abstract = {{Variation in capture efficiency of mist nets among species or with
   weather and habitat may affect the interpretation of mist-netting data
   for studies of habitat use and diurnal activity. Capture efficiency of
   mist nets with a mesh size, of 36 mm was determined by observing birds
   flying towards the nets in various habitats (reed-bed, bushes,
   grassland). The proportion of birds escaping from a mist net shelf after
   having entered it depended on the size of the species and on wind speed.
   Small passerines and species as large as thrushes or larger escaped more
   frequently than intermediate-sized passerine species of 10-25 g. Strong
   winds added 7-16\% to the escape rates under weak winds. The proportion
   of birds avoiding mist nets without entering a shelf depended on the
   degree of shading and net-shelf height, but not on species, wind speed,
   and habitat. Birds flying towards mist nets in full sunlight or towards
   the top shelf avoided the net more frequently than birds flying towards
   partially or completely shaded mist nets or towards lower net shelves.
   We conclude that capture frequencies from mist netting are an adequate
   method for assessing habitat use of small birds, but with certain
   reservations: capture numbers do not represent quantitatively the
   species composition and all mist nets should be similarly exposed to the
   sun and wind (i.e., preferably in a straight line in vegetation as high
   as the nets).}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated two management methods to increase nesting success of
   endangered interior Least Terns (Sterna antillarum) and Snowy Plovers
   (Charadrius alexandrinus) at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge,
   Oklahoma. Nest ridges were constructed from existing substrate and
   designed to provide elevated habitat safe from sheet flooding.
   Solar-powered electric fences were built to reduce predation by mammals.
   Least Tern and Snowy Plover nests on and off ridges were located inside
   and outside fenced areas and revisited every 3-4 d to quantify nest
   success using the Mayfield Method and determine causes of nest failure.
   Nest ridges did not reduce nest losses to flooding and further design
   improvements are necessary. Electric fences did not significantly reduce
   annual egg predation except for Least Terns during one year of the
   study. Pooled data for 1991-1994, however, indicated significantly
   higher Least Tern and slightly higher Snowy Plover nest success inside
   than outside of electric fences.}},

Abstract = {{The Pale-faced Sheathbill (Chionis alba) is an opportunistic
   predator-scavenger. During spring in Antarctica it foraged in colonies
   of southern elephant seals, obtaining placentas, pup carcasses, milk
   from nursing cows, blood, and feces. Afterbirths and pup carcasses
   constituted the bulk of the food consumed. Daily consumption estimates
   averaged 67 g/bird for placenta and 11 g/bird for pup carcasses, which
   are 54\% and 26\% of daily energy requirements, respectively.
   Sheathbills spent 86\% of the day foraging or displaying and 14\%
   resting or preening. Actively feeding birds spent 38\% of the rime
   searching for food, 20\% feeding, 23\% resting, 14\% on comfort

Abstract = {{We examined nest sites of Kentucky Warblers (Oporornis formosus) in
   bottomland hardwood forests in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina to
   determine habitat features that might affect nesting success. We
   measured habitat features at 28 nests and at 28 non-use sites during the
   breeding seasons of 1993 and 1994. All nests were located on the ground
   and were supported by the bases of herbs and woody seedlings.
   Concealment of Kentucky Warbler nests was greater from the sides and
   from above than that of non-use sites. Nest patches were situated in
   tree-fall gaps; canopy coverage of nest patches was less than that of
   non-use patches, and tree stem density in nest patches was lower than in
   non-use patches. Understory vegetation was denser in nest patches than
   in non-use patches, particularly at nest level (0.0-0.5 m). Successful
   Kentucky Warbler nests (n = 19) did not differ from unsuccessful nests
   (n = 8) in any of the variables sampled. Nesting success of Kentucky
   Warblers may not be influenced strongly by vegetation at the nest site.}},

Abstract = {{Color-banded American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) and Black-necked
   Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus) were resighted >50 km from their banding
   locations in the Great Basin. Records from 90 migration and winter
   resightings of birds banded in the Honey Lake Valley (northeastern
   California) and 3 birds banded at Great Salt Lake (Utah) provided unique
   data on long-distance movements by individuals of these species. Avocets
   and stilts left Honey Lake breeding areas and went to stopover areas at
   Mono Lake and in the Tulare Basin as early as July. Some individuals
   spent 48 days or more in the Tulare Basin. Both avocets and stilts were
   observed in sibling groups during migration. Although one pair of banded
   stilts was observed during migration, differences in sex ratio at a
   migration stopover site suggested that male and female stilts might have
   different wintering ranges or migration behavior. Avocets from Honey
   Lake were found wintering along the California coast from Arcata
   southward and along the west coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. First-year
   avocets were more often seen in coastal areas of California (relative to
   inland areas) than were adults. Stilts were found wintering in central
   California. Avocets and stilts banded in Utah were seen in the Tulare
   Basin (one stilt) and at wintering grounds in Mexico (one avocet and one
   stilt), indicating the potential for population mixing. We propose that
   avocets migrate in short hops, retain partial family group associations
   during migration, and may have age-specific differences in migratory
   behavior or wintering range. We propose that stilts retain partial
   family group associations during migration, maintain pair bonds beyond
   the breeding attempt, and have sexual differences in migratory behavior
   or wintering range. These results have important ramifications for
   understanding impacts of drainwater evaporation ponds in the Tulare
   Basin on nonbreeding avocets and stilts.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored 31 pairs of Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) during five
   nesting seasons in east-central Ohio in order to determine the effects
   of time and harassment by European Starlings (Stumus vulgaris) on
   reproductive output. Since flickers have proved to be highly vulnerable
   to competition with starlings for nest sites, flicker pairs are often
   forced to delay nesting until later in the season. If flicker
   reproductive success drops as the nesting season progresses, it is
   likely that flickers that loose nest cavities to starlings early in the
   season will produce fewer offspring than those which do not Flicker
   clutch size for clutches completed before 1 June (early clutches), by
   which time most females that had not lost cavities to starlings had
   completed their initial clutches, was significantly larger than clutch
   size for clutches completed after 1 June (late clutches). Flicker
   nestling and fledgling numbers from early clutches were also
   significantly greater than those from late clutches. Flicker clutch size
   and number of fledglings were negatively correlated with date. Since at
   least 58\% of flicker pairs that delayed clutch completion until after 1
   June were forced to delay by starlings, their reductions in fecundity
   can be attributed to competition with starlings.}},

Abstract = {{Band-recovery data for Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and Herring (L.
   argentatus) Gulls were analyzed to determine the origins of gulls
   breeding within the Great Lakes region, the extent of lake and colony
   fidelity, and the winter and breeding season distributions of gulls of
   various age classes. Most Great Lakes Ring-billed Gulls wintered along
   the Gulf Coast, especially in Florida. Most Herring Gulls wintered along
   Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan, although first-winter birds were more
   widely distributed and were recovered at greater distances than older
   birds. Movement into or out of the Great Lakes region by gulls of
   breeding age was minimal. However, movement among colonies and lakes was
   much more extensive; lakes and colonies do not define distinct
   populations. Gulls banded as chicks tended to return as adults to the
   lake, but not necessarily to the colony, where they where banded. Gulls
   banded as breeding adults were more likely to return in subsequent
   breeding seasons to the colony at which they had been banded than were
   chicks recovered as breeding adults. Gulls are probably not as
   colony-tenacious as previously believed, and natal dispersal plays a
   significant role in establishing or maintaining colonies. Management
   plans for Great Lakes Ring-billed and Herring Gull colonies should
   consider the effects of inter-lake and inter-colony dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Weighing nests with balances during the nestling-feeding period may
   provide the basic information on foraging characteristics. In this paper
   a technique is presented for the installation of electronic balances at
   nests of the hole-nesting Bank Swallow (Riparia riparia), a typical
   colonial breeder. Nest materials with nestlings were dug out and placed
   in a specially designed nest box (Fig. la), called a Riparibox. The
   Riparibox was settled on an electronic balance in the pit (Fig. lb). The
   electronic balance was connected by cables to an IBM PC/AT-compatible
   laptop computer, using serial interfaces (RS-232C) for data
   transmission. For data acquisition and preprocessing, a special program
   package (NestBug), which was developed for the automated observation of
   nests using electronic balances, was used. With this system, continuous
   measurements of parental body mass and lead size were made at two nests
   over 5 d. The time spent by the Bank Swallow on the balance was long
   enough to get precise body-mass measurements. The preliminary analyses
   of data showed a significant increase in body mass and decrease in load
   size with time of day. These relations may indicate growing investment
   in self-maintenance relative to investment in offspring during the day.}},

   Activity budgets showed an increase in the amount of time spent feeding
   from 23\% in 1987 to 38\% in 1992, possibly due to a decline in prey
   abundance. In addition, Common Loons spent more time in shallower waters
   in 1991 and 1992 versus 1987, which mas reflect increases in time needed
   to iind prey. Common Loon behavior was not correlated with water depth
   or time of day No territorial behavior was observed.}},

   arboreal nester. The validity of previous accounts of ground nesting by

Abstract = {{As a result of the importance of food resources, primarily invertebrate
   biomass, to the understanding of reproductive strategies of grassland
   birds, the nutrient and energy characteristics of invertebrate biomass
   were investigated during late spring and early summer. Sweepnets were
   used to collect invertebrate biomass on two sites in eastern Kansas and
   the collections were separated into order or family groups. Nutrient and
   energy characteristics of those taxonomic groups with sufficient biomass
   at the family or order level were measured, Fat contents of families
   ranged from 8\% (dry mass) for Acrididae to 32\% for Miridae. Crude
   protein ranged from 54\% for a composite sample of Hemiptera to 77\% for
   Araneida. Crude fiber ranged from 5-8\% for Araneida to 17-18\% for
   Hemiptera. Calcium levels varied from 1292 ppm in Diptera to 2560 ppm in
   Lepidoptera, and phosphorous levels ranged from 5840 ppm in a composite
   Hemiptera sample to 9360 ppm in Pentatomidae. Gross energy contents
   ranged front 4906 cal/g for a sample of Acrididae to 6452 cal/g for
   Cydnidae. Pooled invertebrate biomass collections from the two sites
   differed in fat, crude fiber and energy content. Implications of these
   results on studies of the interactions of food resources, foraging
   behavior, habitat fragmentation and reproductive strategies of birds are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mist-netting was conducted in riparian habitat near the southern end of
   San Francisco Bay, California during the spring and fall migratory
   periods of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) in 1987-1991. On the
   basis of banding records, spring migration started around 1 April and
   ran through late May with a peak during mid-May Fall migration occurred
   from 1 August through late October. No obvious peaks were apparent in
   the fall, although slight bimodality occurred with peaks in late August
   and mid-September. Males migrated significantly earlier in spring but
   not in fall than did females. Though males stayed longer (4 d) on
   average than did females (3 d), the length of stay on the site during
   spring migratory stopover did not differ significantly between the
   sexes. All but one of the birds staying longer than 5 d were males. No
   significant linear relationship was found between original arrival date
   and length of stay during the spring. The mean mass change during spring
   stopover was the same for males and females (0.4 g). The data presented
   here suggest that the timing of onset of migration rather than the rate
   of migration may be more important in establishing the earlier vernal
   migration of males.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores whether the visual scoring of abdominal profiles can
   be used to evaluate variation in energy stores of shorebirds. Carcass
   analyses showed that the mass of fat in the abdominal cavity is well
   correlated with total fat mass and body mass. In May 1990, abdominal
   profiles were scored of Red Knots (Calidris canutus, subspecies canutus)
   on their last spring staging area in northern Germany before the
   4000-5000-km long flight to the Siberian-arctic breeding grounds. Scores
   made in the field varied between 1 (concave shape of abdomen) to 5
   (bulging). Average abdominal profile scores increased significantly over
   time in May 1990, paralleled by an increase in body mass, as based on
   catches of Red Knots in earlier years. At the end of May the average
   abdominal profile decreased, presumably due to the departure of adult
   Red Knots, leaving lean, perhaps mainly immature, birds behind. The
   scale of abdominal profile scores is probably too coarse to estimate fat
   content of individual waders. On a cohort level, however, the measure
   has much potential for comparisons of (re-)fuelling rates between
   different groups, feeding areas and years without the need to obtain
   large samples of captured birds.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Burrowing Owl (Speotyto cunicularia hypugaea) is declining
   throughout its range, in part as a result of urban development and other
   physical disturbances to owl burrows. One way to protect owls from
   disturbance is to allow birds to relocate to artificial burrows created
   in a safe location. This method, passive relocation of birds using
   artificial burrows, is described in detail and the results of passive
   relocations at six sites in northern California are presented. These
   results suggest that placing artificial burrows as close as possible but
   within approximately 100 m of burrows to be destroyed is expected to
   attract the evicted owls. Passive relocation appears to be a reliable
   way to move owls short distances and it presents fewer risks to birds
   than capturing and relocating them long distances.}},

Abstract = {{Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) population trends and con
   curre nt management on four national forests in eastern Texas were
   evaluated from 1983 through 1993. Following years of decline,
   populations stabilized and began to increase after intensive management
   efforts were initiated. Management activities included control of
   hardwood midstory and understory thinning pines within woodpecker
   cavity-tree cluster areas, use of cavity restrictors and artificial
   cavities, translocation of first-year woodpeckers to replace lost
   breeders, and reintroductions of male and female first-year woodpeckers
   to form totally new breeding pairs. Most newly formed woodpecker groups
   were associated with midstory removal (30) and installation of
   artificial cavities (22). Reversal of severe declines on the three small
   populations in eastern Texas suggests that recovery of other small
   populations throughout the south is an achievable goal if management is
   committed to recovery of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Grasshopper populations on the Delta Agriculture Project area in
   interior Alaska exhibit a strong biennial periodicity (>25/m(2) in one
   year and <1/m(2) in the next). Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus
   sandwichensis) stomach contents were examined during the breeding
   seasons over a 3-yr period. Grasshoppers constituted the largest portion
   (>45\%) of the diet of adult Savannah Sparrows in the high grasshopper)
   years of 1990 and 1992. Beetles and hemipterans comprised the majority
   (66.5\%) of their food in the low grasshopper year of 1991. Grasshopper
   presence in the diet varied in individual birds and among years.
   Occurrence in the diet of other arthropod taxa was independent of year,
   but varied among individuals. Almost no utilization of plant material
   was recorded. The results illustrate the responsiveness of breeding
   birds to a variable food supply and preference for highly nutritious
   grasshoppers when they are available.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous observations by telescope, radar and passive infrared (IR)
   of birds crossing the disk of the moon enabled quantification of the
   proportion of birds seen by moonwatching. Distances of birds recorded by
   moonwatching or infrared were measured by the pencil-beam of a tracking
   radar aimed parallel to the optical observation systems. About 2/3 of
   the birds crossing the disk of the moon within 3 km of the observer were
   seen by the moonwatchers, whereas close to 100\% were detected by
   infrared. The proportion of birds seen by moonwatching decreased
   steadily with distance. The sizes of the birds observed were classified
   by the moonwatcher and on the IR-screen according to the size of the
   silhouette. The size classes obtained by both methods were well
   correlated with the measured distances (the smaller the size the larger
   the distance). Calculating migration traffic rates (MTR) based on radar
   measured distances, according to uniform distribution, or according to
   mean distances per size class, showed that inclusion of size classes can
   improve the accuracy of MTR estimates considerably. Height distributions
   calculated from moonwatch data improved by (1) measured radar distances
   and (2) mean distances per size classes, showed good correlations.
   Moonwatching proved to be a useful method for the observation of bird
   migration below about 1 km height (<2 km distance). The use of size
   classes improves the results; rough indications of preferred height
   zones are possible; at least can nights with migration at low levels
   (and therefore good accuracy of the method) be distinguished from nights
   with high migration (poor accuracy).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{On- and off-road point counts were established in two National Forests
   in northern Minnesota to determine whether breeding bird parameters
   derived from two different types of counts conducted on- or off-road
   were comparable. The first design compared single-year counts randomly
   placed along a road (like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Breeding
   Bird Survey) and counts conducted at least 200 m from the road that were
   placed in a specific habitat. In the second approach, differences and
   similarities were examined in data gathered over 3 yr from points placed
   near roads to points in the same habitat (stand) >200 m from the road.
   Data from the first approach indicated that on average, two more species
   and four more individuals were observed on roadside counts than on
   off-road counts. Twenty-four individual species were more abundant on
   road than off road. Many of these species were ones associated with
   openings or shrubs that develop along roads. Of the five species that
   were more abundant on the off-road counts, three had specific
   associations with lowland conifer habitat, which was not as commonly
   sampled with the on-road counts. Data from the second approach indicated
   that number of species, individuals, and individual species-abundance
   patterns were similar between the paired within-stand points. Greater
   statistical power was achieved for data gathered with habitat specific
   counts off-road primarily because standard errors were lower for bird
   parameters in this data set than in the data collected on road. It is
   suggested that points can be placed on roads with the restriction that
   points be selected randomly and placed within distinct habitat types,
   and that roads selected for sampling have a closed canopy. Evidence
   provided here also suggest that some points be placed off road in
   habitats not sampled with on-road counts.}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at Ardley Island,
   Antarctica, were fitted with data loggers which recorded swim speed,
   dive depth and bird heading at 10- or 15-s intervals. Ten of these birds
   were injected with 5 ml doubly labeled water in the pectoralis, seven
   individuals receiving the full dose in one site whereas in three
   individuals the dose was spread out over four sites. Four birds were not
   injected. None of the injected birds went to sea for longer than 4 min
   within 12 h of their treatment whereas all noninjected birds did so.
   Once-injected birds swam slower and dives were of shorter duration than
   non-injected or four-times-injected birds. In general, once-injected
   birds differed more in their foraging parameters (dive depths, dive
   angles and foraging ranges) from the noninjected birds than did the
   four-times-injected birds. It is suggested that the relatively large
   volume of liquid injected intramuscularly causes discomfort which lasts
   for at least 2 d, which dissuades birds from engaging in normal foraging
   behavior. This problem may be alleviated by multiple small intramuscular
   injections or intra-peritoneal injections.}},

Abstract = {{Dusting by Bewick's Wrens (Thryomanes bewickii) and House Wrens
   (Troglodytes aedon) was observed in 1990 at a common dusting site in

   dusting occurred most frequently shortly before dusk, (2) individuals
   usually dusted alone but sometimes in conspecific pairs, (3) postures
   used were alike and duration of bouts and visits to the dusting site
   were brief, (4) preening occurred during visits to the dusting site, (5)
   sometimes small pebbles or pieces of compacted mud were consumed while
   dusting. Bewick's Wrens displaced House Wrens from the dusting site, the
   reverse interaction was never observed. In addition to controlling the
   accumulation of lipids on the plumage, dusting could help control
   infestations of ectoparasites through cuticular abrasion of the parasite
   exoskeleton, which leads to rapid desiccation in insects.}},

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers were studied in the Medicine Bow National Forest of
   southcentral Wyoming during 1991 and 1992 to identify habitats used for
   foraging and nesting. A key component of this study was to evaluate the
   snag-retention policy of the forest. Thirty of the 33 nests of
   woodpeckers were in aspen trees. Woodpeckers nested in aspen trees with
   an average dbh of 26.7 cm (range 18-45 cm). This diameter was larger
   than the mean dbh of available aspen, 11.8 cm, or snags, 9.0 cm. The
   majority of the aspen stands used for nesting were comprised of large
   trees (>20 cm dbh). Woodpeckers were observed foraging in all forest
   types, but spruce-fir forest was used for foraging more frequently than
   it occurred in the study sites. Snags were seldom used for nesting or
   foraging because they were often smaller than 18 cm dbh and in open
   clear cuts. Larger snags at the edge of clear cuts or in the forest
   would in all likelihood enhance woodpecker nesting and foraging sites.}},

Abstract = {{Factors that might limit distribution and ability to thermoregulate were
   examined in a male Broad-tailed Hummingbird (Selasphorus platycercus)
   wintering in Arizona, unusual for this species. As in the breeding
   season, territorial activity and feeding did not begin until incident
   daylight intensity exceeded 11 lux. The daylength available for
   attaining positive energy balance was one-third shorter than in the
   summer. Meal size increased through the day. By evening, cumulative
   intake of sucrose was sufficient to fuel maintenance of a high,
   non-torpid, temperature for 14 h of nocturnal fast, even without the
   small flying insects and nectar from introduced Salvia, taken to
   supplement the feeder solution. In contrast to the subordinate status of
   broad-tails wintering in Mexico, this bird excluded larger Anna's and
   smaller Costa's Hummingbirds from his territory. His January-February
   molt timing was similar to that of a population wintering in Jalisco,
   fitting the annual cycle of northern breeders. The Tucson male returned
   the following autumn, proving his ability for extralimital survival and

Abstract = {{The nesting biology of the Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) was
   studied at the northern limit of its breeding range at Churchill,
   Canada. This region is colder and has a shorter breeding season than any
   in which the species was previously studied. Yellow Warblers arrived in
   Churchill before most deciduous vegetation had emerged and, in some
   instances, when snow still covered the ground. Warblers at this location
   built larger and better insulated nests than in southern populations,
   presumably as an adaptation against the cooler temperatures. Clutch size
   averaged 4.65 eggs and was larger than in all other populations studied
   so far, except those in Alaska. Nestlings grew rapidly and survivorship
   was similar to southern populations; only about 4\% of chicks were lost
   through brood reduction. Males fed young more frequently than females or
   males in southern areas. These observations suggest that Yellow Warblers
   may compensate for the short subarctic summer by arriving on the
   breeding grounds earlier, building larger and better insulated nests,
   and investing more in male parental care than birds in other locations.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented of 30 pairs of morning and afternoon roadside
   surveys of New World vultures and diurnal birds of prey in farmland
   habitat in eastern Pennsylvania during the non-breeding season.
   Eight-hundred-twenty-seven raptors, including members of two species of
   vultures and 10 species of diurnal birds of prey, were counted on 60
   surveys between October 1992 and December 1994. Three species of
   raptors, Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo
   jamaicensis) and American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), comprised 90\% of
   all birds sighted. Although almost equal numbers of birds were seen on
   morning and afternoon surveys, species composition, the numbers of
   birds, and the flight behavior of individual species, differed
   significantly on morning and afternoon surveys. Time of day of survey
   affected different species differently. Numbers of Turkey Vultures
   increased significantly, those of Red-tailed Hawks decreased
   significantly, and those of American Kestrels remained the same between
   morning and afternoon surveys. In general, sampling variance was higher
   on morning than on afternoon surveys. These results, which clearly
   demonstrate the need to take time of day into account when conducting
   roadside surveys of raptors, suggest that the ability to compare data
   from different sites is limited by the extent to which those data were
   collected at the same time of day.}},

Abstract = {{Nest attendance patterns during incubation were compared in sympatric
   populations of Harris' Sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) and Gambel's
   White-crowned Sparrows (Z. leucophrys gambelii) in the Northwest
   Territories, Canada, In both species, only females incubated. Females of
   both species spent similar proportions of their active day incubating,
   but duration of bouts on and off nests were significantly longer for
   Harris' Sparrows. Duration of bouts on nests decreased with increasing
   ambient temperature (T-a) in White-crowned Sparrows. In Harris'
   Sparrows, duration of bouts on nests decreased with increasing T-a up to
   20 C, but increased in length at higher T(a)s. Interspecific differences
   in incubation patterns may have resulted from the greater risk of egg
   hyperthermia in Harris' than White-crowned Sparrow nests, because the
   former are placed in more open locations and exposed to increased solar
   radiation. In both species, duration of bouts off nests increased with
   T-a. Increased length of bouts away from nests in Harris' Sparrows may
   have resulted in part from reduced cooling rates of their eggs, as
   influenced by the species nest microclimate and greater egg mass.
   Susceptibility to predation may also have affected incubation behavior.
   As Harris' Sparrow nests are subject to greater risk of predation than
   White-crowned Sparrow nests, female Harris' Sparrows could reduce risks
   to themselves and protect their nests more effectively by taking fewer,
   lengthier trips to and from the nest and remaining on their eggs for
   longer periods.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of 1399 North American woodpeckers were examined to assess
   flight-feather replacement patterns and their use in aging. The
   primaries and rectrices are fully replaced during the first prebasic
   molt in most species, but fully retained in two species. In contrast,
   all species typically retain secondaries and primary coverts during the
   first prebasic molt, and the regular retention of up to six secondaries
   during definitive prebasic molts is found in some birds of most species.
   Replacement of the primary coverts during the second prebasic molt is
   incomplete, 0-5 consecutive outer coverts typically being renewed. This
   delayed replacement pattern of primary coverts, not corresponding to the
   replacement of the primaries, may be unique in woodpeckers (and perhaps
   certain kingfishers) among birds. By combining retention patterns with
   differences in color pattern and relative wear between juvenal and adult
   feathers, many woodpeckers can be reliably aged through their third or
   fourth year of life.}},

Abstract = {{Flight altitudes of birds were monitored in east-central Alaska during
   spring and fall migration periods with visual (1987-1989) and radar
   (1988-1989) methods. Visual observations indicated that diurnal flights
   occurred primarily below 300 m above ground level (agl). Radar
   observations indicated that nocturnal flights generally occurred below
   500 m agl. Flight altitudes were significantly higher in fall than in
   spring, and there were interannual differences in both seasons. There
   was high night-to-night variability in nocturnal flight altitudes during
   both seasons. This night-to-night variability probably was not related
   to daily changes in the magnitude of migration: there was a very low
   correlation between mean nightly flight altitudes and mean nightly
   migration rates. Nocturnal flight altitudes were higher from April to
   early May than from mid- to late May and higher from late August to
   early September than from mid-September to mid-October. These seasonal
   differences in flight altitudes largely were due to changing species
   composition within a season. When spring radar data were partitioned
   among light conditions, flight altitudes were found to be similar
   between daylight and crepuscular periods and between daylight and
   nocturnal periods, but birds flew significantly higher in crepuscular
   than nocturnal periods. In fall, nocturnal altitudes were significantly
   higher than crepuscular and daylight altitudes, which were similar.
   Within a night, there was no near-midnight peak in flight altitudes in
   either spring or fall.}},

Abstract = {{Several types of jesses are used to restrain captive raptors. The
   Hollywood jess described here has been tested on six species during two
   decades. Like the Aylmeri jess now in common use in North America, the
   Hollywood jess consists of a removable rolled button jess and an anklet.
   Unlike the Aylmeri anklet, however, the Hollywood anklet can be removed
   and reattached without restraining the bird. This anklet makes the
   Hollywood jess the safest of all jesses. It can also be used repeatedly
   on different individuals and allows for the bird to be released in its
   pen or to the wild without encumbrances.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that Blackpoll Warblers (Dendroica striata) make
   transoceanic flights in autumn from the northeastern U.S. and
   southeastern Canada to South America has been proposed or supported in
   more than 25 papers by many authors, using many techniques. Murray
   (1989; unpubl.) has criticized this hypothesis, but cited only a few of
   these papers and misrepresented much of the information that he did
   cite. Murray misstated information on the location of the western fringe
   of the SSE flights, the importance of misidentifications, and the
   phenology of departures. Murray's comparison of regional mean masses was
   invalid, because the data sets were heterogeneous and non-comparable.
   Contra Murray, all radar studies in the area have reported directed
   flights of birds identified as songbirds towards the SSE over the
   western North Atlantic Ocean. Under Murray's alternative hypotheses, the
   entire continental population of the species would be concentrated into
   the coastal plain of the southeastern U.S., but he has cited only two
   specific records for this entire area. The general statements of status
   that he cited are outdated, unreliable, and/or undocumented. In
   contrast, Nisbet (1970a) and McNair and Post (1993a) cited numerous
   published and unpublished records for this area, including McNair and
   Post's own extensive field work. These data show that the species is
   scarce to rare in this area, decisively refuting Murray's hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique for collecting fecal-urate samples from nestling
   American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) was developed and tested while
   conducting field research on the detection and effects of agrochemical
   exposure. The technique was later modified and successfully used to
   collect samples from hand-reared nestling kestrels in a controlled
   exposure experiment. Sample collection in both studies incorporated the
   use of a `'diaper'' fastened to nestlings in different manners. The
   original design consisted of making a diaper out of a corner section of
   a plastic sandwich bag. The modified design secured a small balloon over
   a much smaller surface area by means of elastic string suspenders.
   Sampling was successful in 74\% of all field attempts (n = 111) and in
   97\% of collections in the controlled dosing study (n = 32). This
   technique simplifies collection of fecal-urate samples from nestling
   kestrels for use in a variety of biomonitoring studies. The technique
   may also be adaptable to other species of birds.}},

Abstract = {{The patterns of avian nest predation along a forest-open ecotone located
   in a remote, undisturbed area of Colombian Amazonia were analyzed using
   wicker nests to determine whether or not nest predation increased along
   a natural gradient and whether nest predation was equivalent to that
   measured in temperate areas. Nest loss increased from rainforest to
   large, hill-top clearings in relation to the decrease of tree and shrub
   cover. There was no evidence, however, of a parallel increase in the
   abundance of egg predators. The observed nest predation indices in the
   Amazonian rainforests were quite similar to those obtained in large
   North American forests. These results are consistent with Oniki's (1979)
   hypothesis about the lack of differences of nest predation rates between
   temperate and tropical forest habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of birds on 54 circular plots (50-m radius) were counted in two
   Colorado forest sites for 2 yr, then four artificial nest boxes were
   added to each of 27 of the plots, and counts continued for 2 more yr.
   Combined abundances of eight box-using species increased more than
   threefold on experimental plots compared to unmanipulated control plots,
   apparently as a result of the box additions. Common cavity-nesting
   species that responded most strongly to nest box additions included the
   Mountain Chickadee (Parus gambeli), Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) and
   House Wren (Troglodytes aedon). Combined abundances of open-nesting
   species did not change on experimental versus control plots during the
   experiment. Results of this study suggest that secondary cavity-nesters
   were limited by the quantity or quality of available nest sites, but
   that increased numbers of cavity-nesting species had no affect on
   abundances of open-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{The Serra do Tabuleiro, Santa Catarina, South Brazil, is one of the
   least disturbed areas of the southern Atlantic rainforest. The Serra do
   Tabuleiro is the third largest remnant left in pristine conditions of
   the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. During the last years, rare and
   endangered species such as the Harpy Eagle (Harpya harpyja), the Ornate
   Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), and the Black Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus
   tyrannus) were recorded in the region. Harpy Eagles have been recorded
   since 1962, including records in 1980 and 1989, which suggest that there
   may still exist a population in the slopes and gorges covered with
   Montane Atlantic Rain Forest and probably in other coastal mountains of
   Santa Catarina. Information on additional poorly known raptors is also
   given. The recent presence of Harpy Eagle urgently calls for an
   effective conservation action in the Serra do Tabuleiro region. Harpy
   Eagle is an indicator of a still intact ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-two Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nesting territories and 31
   occupied eagle nests were documented on the north slope of the Brooks
   Range in northeastern Alaska, 1988-1990, in an area previously thought
   to be marginal breeding habitat for eagles. The mean number of
   young/successful nest was 1.25 in 1988, 1.27 in 1989, and 1.13 in 1990;
   means did not differ significantly among years. Eighty percent (20/25)
   of the nestlings for which age was estimated were assumed to have
   successfully fledged. Nesting success was 79\% (11/14) in 1989, the only
   year nesting success could be determined. Laying dates ranged from 23
   March (1990) to 11 May (1989) with mean estimated laying dates differing
   significantly among years. Annual variation in nesting phenology
   coincided with annual differences in snow accumulations during spring.
   These results indicate that Golden Eagles consistently and successfully
   breed at the northern extent of their range in Alaska, although,
   productivity may be lower than that for eagles at more southern
   latitudes.}},

   likely to result from inadvertantly calculating observer hours rather

Abstract = {{Density estimates are important to investigations of population dynamics
   and the effectiveness of management activities. Methods currently used
   to estimate density of breeding female Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on
   localized study areas were derived ad hoc and have never been validated.
   The accuracy of ad-hoc estimates was tested by comparing them to
   mark-resight estimates of female density During spring 1993, 61 females
   were color- and radio-marked in southcentral Saskatchewan, and density
   was estimated via ad-hoc and mark-resight methods using data from four
   surveys. The assumptions and minimum data requirements of the
   mark-resight technique were met, and a reliable benchmark estimate of
   density was developed using data from the second survey (3.7
   females/km(2), SE = 0.8). Ad-hoc and mark-resight estimates were
   significantly different (P = 0.046), with the ad-hoc estimate being
   greater by 1.5 females/km(2). For many research and monitoring
   applications, this level of error may be inconsequential, and the ad-hoc
   estimator, which is more easily applied than the mark-resight estimator,
   may be adequate. The mark-resight estimator can be used to provide more
   accurate estimates with measured precision but requires that large
   samples of females be color- and radio-marked, monitored and resighted.}},

Abstract = {{Although losses of Common Poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii) nests to
   predators are common, little is known about predation on adults. Remains
   of three adults, radio-tagged in Cypress Hills Provincial Park,
   Saskatchewan, were found. The transmitter of a female was found woven
   into the base of a Northern Harrier's (Circus cyaneus) nest. Telemetry
   records show that the bird was killed in the daytime, consistent with
   harrier predation. The wing and transmitter of the female's mate were
   found on a stump surrounded by a marsh, suggesting avian predation. This
   male was also killed in the daytime, implicating harrier predation. The
   decapitated body of a second male was found buried next to a stump. It
   is speculated that this bird was taken by a coyote (Canis latrans) or
   badger (Taxidea taxus) because both are known to bury prey and were
   often observed in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The value of radio telemetry for waterfowl research depends on the
   availability of suitable methods of attaching transmitters. Tn previous
   studies, external transmitters attached to adult Mallards (Anas
   platyrhynchos) with sutures and glue did not stay on birds reliably. In
   an attempt to improve transmitter retention, a method of attachment was
   tested in which 4-g transmitters were attached mid-dorsallvy with
   sutures and with a stainless steel anchor-shaped wire inserted
   subcutaneously (anchor transmitters). Field tests indicated that all of
   26 female Mallards and 63 of 65 female Gadwalls (Anas strepera) retained
   their anchor transmitters during 4369 bird-days of monitoring during
   nesting and brood rearing. Survival races of females with anchor
   transmitters compared favorably with those reported from other studies.
   In this study, females with and without anchor transmitters did not
   differ with respect to survival rates of their ducklings. The anchor
   transmitter may be suitable for a variety of field studies on numerous
   species.}},

Abstract = {{When Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis) eggs were laid no air cells were

   Following this rapid initial development, air cells increased in
   diameter an average of 0.59 mm/d and 14 d after laying had an average
   diameter of 13.0 mm. Initial development of air cells was enhanced by
   cool air temperatures while subsequent development was dependent on
   heat. Air cells developed faster after the onset of incubation. Air fell
   size can be used to determine the sequence of laying and to estimate the
   age of eggs, but such applications are limited by variations in the rate
   of air cell formation. Eggs lost an average of 0.38 g, or 12.2\% of
   their initial mass, during incubation. Air cell diameter on the day

Abstract = {{Migratory and resident shorebirds were censused from a vehicle or on
   foot at the Cabo Rojo salt flats, Puerto Rico from 1985 to 1992. A total
   of 28 species was identified. Highest number of individuals was recorded
   between August and December, and again in March each year. Migrants made
   up about 87\% of the counts annually except in June when counts were
   split evenly between resident and migrant species. The most abundant
   migrants were small calidrid sandpipers, Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa
   flavipes) and Stilt Sandpipers (Calidris himantopus). Black-necked
   Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus) were the most abundant resident species.
   During fall, daily peak counts ranged from 3477 to 8059 individuals.
   August had the highest mean counts (3459 +/- 896 SE). Shorebird numbers
   recorded in October, the midpoint of fall migration, remained stable
   over 8 yr. Within the salt flats, shorebird distribution varied by
   census unit, season and year. Factors influencing their distribution
   include food availability and hydrological conditions,which are largely
   the result of salt extraction operations. The salt flats are numerically
   the most important site for shorebirds in Puerto Rico. Regionally, the
   salt flats are an important stopover area when compared to 22 other
   sites in the Caribbean. Of the peak number of shorebirds reported for
   all sites, 29\% were recorded at the salt flats. The salt flats are of
   regional importance to small calidrids, Stilt Sandpipers, and Snowy
   Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two radio transmitter attachment techniques on captive
   and one attachment technique on wild Bald Eagles (Habiaeetus
   leucocephalus) were studied. A Y-attachment method with a 160-g dummy
   transmitter was less apt to cause tissue damage on captive birds than an
   X-attachment method, and loosely fit transmitters caused less damage
   than tightly fit transmitters. Annual survival of wild birds fitted with
   65-g transmitters via an X attachment was estimated at 90-95\%. As a
   result of high survival, only five wild birds marked as nestlings were
   recovered. Two of these birds had superficial pressure sores from
   tight-fitting harnesses. It is recommended that a 1.3-cm space be left
   between the transmitter and the bird's back when radio-tagging

Abstract = {{Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) abundance, nestling production and
   eggshell thickness were estimated at two colonies in 1993 to provide
   information for public and private wildlife management programs in
   northern Delaware. Flight directions taken by birds departing from one
   colony were recorded to identify primary foraging areas. Other predatory
   bird populations in the upper Delaware Bay estuary are characterized by
   relatively high organochlorine residues and low reproductive success.
   Both heron colonies showed high overall reproductive success. Successful
   nests produced approximately 2.4 young to age 20-40 d. Eggs failing to
   hatch at one colony were thin relative to failed eggs found at the
   second colony, and to shell thickness documented in other studies.
   Preliminary observations suggest that herons from the two colonies may
   utilize different foraging wetlands in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of far infrared (FIR) thermal imaging devices to detect and
   census birds in the field was examined. A Thermovision 210 was used to
   survey individuals and/or nests of Great-horned Owls (Bubo virginianus),
   Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus), Northern Flickers (Colaples
   auratus), Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), Buffle-heads
   (Bucephala albeola), Malards (Anas platyrhynchos), Green-winged Teal
   (Anas crecca), Lapland Longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) and Pectoral
   Sandpipers (Erolia melanotos). Thermal imaging was successful in
   determining activity at nests of all four cavity-nesting species and in
   finding nests of Arctic tundra birds if their approximate location was
   known. FIR thermal imaging was not useful, however, in detecting the
   active, open nests of Mallards or Green-winged Teal, nor was it useful
   in locating resting waterfowl or Great-horned Owls. It was successful at
   locating Arctic tundra birds. These differences are largely attributable
   to variation among species in the insulative property of nests or
   feathers. It is concluded that FIR imaging will be of limited utility in
   censusing most avian populations, although it may provide a useful,
   abeit expensive tool, to assess nest occupancy of cavity- or
   burrow-nesting birds, or to determine the activity of birds in open
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The configuration, components, specifications and costs of a
   state-of-the-art closed-circuit television system with wide application
   for wildlife research and management are described. The principal system
   components consist of color CCTV camera with zoom lens, pan/tilt system,
   infrared illuminator, heavy duty tripod, coaxial cable, coaxitron
   system, half-duplex equalizing video/control amplifier, time-lapse video
   cassette recorder, color video monitor, VHS video cassettes, portable
   generator, fuel tank and power cable. This system was developed and used
   in a study of Mississippi Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis pratensis)
   behaviors during incubation, hatching and fledging. The main advantages
   of the system are minimal downtime where a complete record of every
   event, its time of occurrence and duration, are permanently recorded and
   can be replayed as many times as necessary there-after to retrieve the
   data. The system is particularly applicable for studies of behavior and
   predation, for counting individuals, or recording difficult to observe
   activities. The system can be run continuously for several weeks by two
   people, reducing personnel costs. This paper is intended to provide
   biologists who have little knowledge of electronics with a system that
   might be useful to their specific needs. The disadvantages of this
   system are the initial costs (about \$9800 basic, 1990-1991 U.S.
   dollars) and the time required to playback video cassette tapes for data
   retrieval, but the playback can be sped up when little or no activity of
   interest is taking place. In our study, the positive aspects of the
   system far outweighed the negative}},

Abstract = {{Over 7 yr nesting success, nest mortality and reproductive behavior of
   female Boat-tailed Grackles (Quiscalus major) nesting in a freshwater
   impoundment in South Carolina were examined. Most (96\% of 1368) nests
   were built in colonies on cattail (Typha spp.) islands. Average colony
   size ranged from 7 to 10 nests; maximum size ranged from 20 to 37 nests.
   Average distance between nearest-neighbor colony nests was 3.5 m.
   Breeding was synchronized, and at least 50\% of all nests in the
   population were started within 12-16 d of the first. Females used dead
   (overwintering) vegetation for nesting, but colony sites did not appear
   to be limited. The breeding biology of Boat-tailed Grackles in South
   Carolina differs little from that reported for a population nesting in
   cattail marshes in central Florida, 600 km SW. In each region, 61\% of
   nests produced at least one fledgling. Daily mortality rates of eggs
   were slightly lower in South Carolina, but mortality rates of nestlings
   were the same. Unlike in Florida, no difference was found between the
   survival of two-egg and three-egg clutches. In both regions, predation
   was the main cause of nest loss. Starvation was the second most
   important mortality factor in South Carolina, where it was relatively

Abstract = {{An efficient, non-invasive protocol to quantify the diet of nestling
   Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) was described and

   nestlings. During four vials with three woodpecker groups in 1992 and
   1993, a video camera with a passive infrared sensor, a `'lipstick''
   fiber optics camera, a manual focus camera attached to a spotting scope,
   and an autofocus camera with an active infrared detector were evaluated.
   Use of a Nikon F4 camera and flash attachment affixed to a deer stand
   and interfaced with a Trailmaster sensor unit mounted on the cavity tree
   enabled identification of approximately 65\% of the arthropods in nearly
   3000 photographs of adults bringing food to the nestlings. The other
   setups had serious drawbacks and were deemed unsuitable.}},

   are needed on microhabitat use (tree/shrub species and foraging
   substates), nest site selection, foraging ecology (feeding behavior and

   Ornithologists are urged to collect these critical data so that prudent

   Wooden cross-like nest sites, providing four quadrants with 20-cm high
   and 61-cm long boards on two sides of each quadrant, were occupied by
   nesting elders. Previous research had shown that sites based on the
   design developed for the eastern Atlantic subspecies (S. m. dressen)
   were not used by the arctic Alaska subspecies (S. m. v-nigra) perhaps
   due to different predation pressures in the two regions.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use and foraging behavior of the Chestnut-sided Warbler
   (Dendroica pensylvanica), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), Mourning
   Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia) and Nashville Warbler (Vermivora
   ruficapilla) were studied in a second-growth forest in northern
   Wisconsin (USA) during the breeding season. Our objective was to
   determine if interspecific and intersexual foraging differences exist
   among these species. The warblers concentrated foraging activities on a
   few species of trees and shrubs. Compared to other species, Canada
   Warblers more frequently used coniferous trees that were scattered
   through the primarily deciduous habitat. All species most frequently
   used branches of trees, but male Nashville Warblers also made
   considerable use of leaves and twigs. Warblers foraged al a variety of
   heights in the vegetation, with male Nashville Warblers foraging highest
   in the midstory and canopy of mature trees. Females of all species
   tended to be active lower in the vegetation than males. Cleaning was the
   most frequently used foraging method, except for male Canada Warblers,
   which used foraging methods involving flight in about 70\% of prey
   pursuits. When 30 foraging-related characters were considered
   simultaneously in a multivariate analysis, it was found that intersexual
   differences within a species were less pronounced than interspecific
   differences, except Nashville Warbler males, which were distinct in
   their foraging. When designing a conservation strategy for these
   species, biologists must recognize that these birds require heterogenous
   second-growth forests.}},

Abstract = {{Male and female Common (Acridotheres tristis) and White-vented Mynas (A.
   javanicus) are not clearly sexually dimorphic and are thus difficult to
   identify in the field. Discriminant analysis of nine morphometric
   characters of adult birds indicates that tail length, gape length,
   culmen length, toe length, wing length (maximum chord), tarsus length
   and body mass contributed significantly to sex identification in Common
   Mynas, while male and female White-vented Mynas could be separated based
   on culmen length, beak length, wing length, body mass and toe length. In
   both species, males were on average, larger than females for the
   discriminating characters. Univariate analysis of variance of the
   discriminant scores suggests that the linear discriminant function was
   effective in sex determination for both species. Application of the
   Jackknife'' technique to the same sample of birds showed that the linear
   discriminant function correctly classified 89\% of 57 male and 76\% of
   33 female Common Mynas, and 81\% of 42 male and 51\% of 27 female
   White-vented Mynas. Live birds that were sexed based on the
   discriminating morphometric characters and randomly paired in separate
   compartments in outdoor aviaries laid fertile clutches, indicating the
   viability of using morphometrics as a field technique to sex mynas.}},

Abstract = {{A continentwide survey of homes with bird Feeders produced 567 reports
   documenting 1138 incidents of predation. Of the 25 species of predators
   recorded, three (Sharp-shinned Hawk, Accipiter striatus; domestic cat;
   Cooper's Hawk, A cooperii) were responsible for 80\% of the incidents in
   which the predator was known. Ten of the 62 species of prey identified
   accounted for 32\% of all victims. The birds most vulnerable to
   predation were those that commonly occur at feeders throughout the
   continent (i.e., the most widespread species), but additionally,
   flocking species were more vulnerable to avian predators than more
   solitary ones. Prey size was correlated to size of avian predators, but
   cats concentrated on small birds. Hawks were attracted to feeders with
   particularly high levels of bird activity, but cats were not. The
   bird-feeding environment does not appear to expose birds to a higher
   risk of predation than is encountered in the absence of feeders.}},

Abstract = {{If cavity-entrance orientation confers some benefit (e.g.,
   thermoregulation of eggs and young) to secondary hole-nesting birds,
   individuals should use cavities with certain entrance orientations, and
   the orientation of a cavity's entrance should influence reproductive
   success. During a 2-yr study conducted at natural cavity populations in
   southeastern Ontario, Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were found to
   prefer cavities whose entrances faced S-SE, but the orientations of
   cavity entrances did not differ between pairs that fledged young and
   those whose breeding attempts failed. European Starlings (Sturnus
   vulgaris) did not show a preference for cavities whose entrance faced a
   specific compass direction. The conclusions of other similar studies are
   reviewed and several reasons why research concerned with the influence
   of cavity-entrance orientation on nest-site use by secondary
   hole-nesting birds has yielded inconsistent conclusions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents new data on the nesting success of House Wrens
   (Troglodytes aedon) using natural nest sites (tree cavities) in
   north-central Wyoming, and summarizes information on the nesting success
   of other North American cavity-nesting birds using natural nest sites.
   Of 99 House Wren nests in natural cavities observed over a 4-yr period,
   an estimated 63\% of nests produced at least one fledgling. Nest failure
   occurred more frequently during the laying and incubation stages of
   breeding (62\% of failures) than during the nestling stage. The success
   rate of nests in natural cavities did not differ significantly from the
   success rate of nests in tree-mounted boxes in the same population,
   probably because predators destroyed a relatively high proportion of
   nests in tree-mounted boxes. Nest failure in tree-mounted boxes also
   occurred more frequently during the laying and incubation stages of
   breeding (60\% of failures) than during the nestling stage. The
   incidence of nest failure was greatly reduced by mounting nest boxes on
   greased metal poles. A literature survey revealed that rates of nesting
   success for North American cavity-nesting birds using tree cavities as
   nest sites range from 22 to 100\% with a mean of 68\%. Woodpeckers have
   the highest mean rate of success (77\%), followed by other types of
   birds that excavate their own cavities (66\%), and birds that use
   pre-existing cavities (54\%). Excavators, as a group, have significantly
   greater success (74\%) than non-excavators.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by 17 radio-tagged Eastern Screech-Owls (Otus asio) was
   examined in central Kentucky. On a rural study area, owls used woodlot
   (deciduous forest) and edge habitats more than expected based on
   availability, and used pastures, old fields and cropland less than
   expected. Screech-owls may prefer wooded habitats because they offer
   increased prey availability and suitable hunting perches. During the
   non-breeding period, some adult screech-owls increased use of woodlot
   habitat. This shift may reflect improved hunting conditions in woodlots
   and changes in roosting behavior during winter, i.e., owls shift to
   roosting in tree cavities in woodlots. Juvenile screech-owls used edge
   habitats more during the non-breeding (post-dispersal) period. If
   woodlot habitat is preferred during this period, as indicated by the
   behavior of adults, then resident, adult screech-owls may be limiting
   juveniles to suboptimal edge habitats.}},

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Two methods for counting seabirds from ships were compared during a
   research cruise in the marginal ice zone of the northwestern Weddell Sea
   in the Southern Ocean (European Polarstern Study 1988/1989-EPOS). The
   basic difference between the two methods concerns the way in which birds
   in Right are recorded. Methods using continuous counts of all birds
   crossing the transect area in Flight result in bias in density estimates
   because they measure flux rather than density. In the Southern Ocean the
   continuous method has been used as the standard in the BIOMASS program.
   To avoid bias due to bird movement, the Scottish Seabirds at Sea Team
   (SAST) recommended the snapshot method which uses instantaneous counts
   of birds in flight at specific time intervals to cover consecutive
   subsectors of the census area. Comparative investigations during EPOS
   showed that continuous counts resulted in bird density estimates about
   twice as high as densities derived from snapshot counts. The level of
   bias caused by continuous counts fluctuated widely between and within
   species. Effects of different variables such as species-specific
   behavior, ship's speed, and windforce are difficult to separate. The use
   of instantaneous counts of birds in flight is strongly recommended
   because they yield better estimates of both relative and absolute
   densities of seabirds at sea.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty percent of the food supplied by male Marsh Harriers (Circus

   the late nestling stages, and also increased with increasing brood size.
   This may be explained by a greater female demand behavior as the food
   requirements of the brood grow. Thus aerial food transfer may be
   interpreted as a female demand behavior, which forces the male to
   increase hunting effort. The use of the aerial food transfer as a demand
   behavior among raptors should be limited to maneuverable species with
   reversed sexual dimorphism and female dominance.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of using rectrix shape to classify Wood Thrushes
   (Hylocichia mustelirza) as second year (SY) or older birds (after second
   year {[}ASY]) was conservatively tested. SY feathers generally appear
   narrow and pointed, ASY ones broader and shouldered. Twenty persons with
   no experience handling or banding birds were able to classify single
   rectrices pulled from known-aged birds with 70-80\% accuracy in three
   separate tests. Half of the subjects received feedback about their
   errors on Tests 1 and 2 bur were not significantly more accurate than
   the non-feedback group on any subsequent rests. Higher scores on Test 3
   than on Test 1 by both groups and scores of 80-95\% by two persons who
   had field experience with the technique indicate that experience can
   improve accuracy. Even greater accuracy should result when all
   rectrices, plus other plumage features that were found to be helpful but
   less consistent, can be examined together in an intact bird.}},

Abstract = {{From 1982 through 1986, solar-powered radio transmitters were attached
   to 23 adult and seven fledgling Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis),
   seven adult Ferruginous Hawks (B. regalis) and seven adult Swainson's
   Hawks (B. swainsoni) in eastern Colorado. Transmitters were attached by
   means of a teflon-ribbon harness as a backpack (n = 39), or epoxied and
   sutured to the rachis of a tail feather (n = 5). Excluding transmitters
   that appeared to fail immediately after release (n = 3), or that were
   lost when tail feathers were shed prematurely (n = 5), the time from
   release to last telemetry contact (minimum life) for adult hawks ranged
   from 14 to 2331 d ((x) over bar = 452, n = 26). The median minimum
   transmitter life for adult hawks was 352 d; 15 (58\%) of 26 adult hawks
   Fitted with backpack-mounted transmitters that were not subsequently
   found dead on the study area (n = 2) were observed with functioning
   transmitters greater than or equal to 1 breeding season subsequent to
   capture. Minimum life for transmitters on juvenile hawks ranged from 59,
   to 108 days ((x) over bar = 73, n = 7) and last telemetry contact
   coincided with when young dispersed from natal territories. All nine
   adult Red-tailed Hawks, six (86\%) of seven Ferruginous Hawks, and six
   (100\%) of six Swainson's Hawks captured and fitted with radio
   transmitters during the breeding season successfully raised young to
   banding age in the year that they were captured. In the subsequent
   breeding season, active nests were located in eight (89\%) of nine
   Red-tailed Hawk, three (43\%) of seven Ferruginous Hawk, and four (67\%)
   of six Swainson's Hawk territories where adults had previously been
   captured. Success of these nests was 100\% for Red-railed Hawks, 67\%
   for Ferruginous Hawks, and greater than or equal to 50\% for Swainson's
   Hawks, One Red-tailed Hawk captured as a breeding adult survived a
   minimum of nine breeding seasons while equipped with a transmitter and
   successfully raised young to banding age in greater than or equal to 7
   of those years.}},

Abstract = {{Nest predation, brood parasitism, and edge-dependent fledgling output
   were measured in four passerine species inhabiting Sheep Creek Valley, a
   large riparian shrub wetland near Juneau, southeastern Alaska. Frequency
   of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) fledglings in passerine broods
   and abundance of adult cowbirds were also measured in the valley and in
   nearby upland forest. The Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) and
   Swainson's Thrush (Catharus swainsoni) were single-brooded, while the
   Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca) and American Robin (Turdus migratorius)
   were double-brooded. The Yellow Warbler had high (>90\%), and the
   sparrow and robin intermediate (45-65\%) nest success with both the
   apparent and Mayfield methods. Nest predation was a major cause of nest
   failure in air four species. No cowbirds (eggs, young, or adults) were
   found. Fledglings/nest was edge-independent in the Yellow Warbler and
   the sparrow and robin (latter two species pooled); the breeding bird
   community of Sheep Creek Valley is apparently not suffering
   edge-dependent nest predation and brood parasitism observed in other
   anthropogenic landscapes. One possible explanation of these results is
   thar southeastern Alaska is still geographically isolated from the

Abstract = {{A field experiment, offering a choice of two prey fish of unequal sizes
   to foraging Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucoceophalus), was devised. The
   objective of the field experiment was to determine if eagles preferred
   one prey item over another, and if this preference varied between
   breeding and non-breeding seasons. A total of 67 trials were conducted
   on four nesting pairs of eagles, 32 trials in the breeding season and 35
   in the non-breeding season. Eagles selected the large fish 71.8\% of the
   time during the breeding season, as opposed to 34.2\% in the
   non-breeding season. Eagles took the small fish in about equal numbers
   in each season (25.0\% breeding, 28.6\% non-breeding). Eagles faired to
   respond to either fish size 37.1\% of the time during the non-breeding
   season, however, as opposed to one instance of no response (3.1\%) in
   the breeding season. Mean response time was generally shorter in the
   breeding season than in the non-breeding season, and eagles responded
   more quickly when they took the large fish irrespective of season. It is
   concluded that eagles discriminate between large and small prey items,
   and may alter their prey selection based upon increased energetic
   requirements of the breeding season. These results were consistent with
   predictions of optimal foraging models and suggest reasons, in addition
   to changing prey availability, why food habits of Bald Eagles vary
   between the breeding and non-breeding season.}},

   American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and reported that two or three

   Survival data from two on-going studies of American Crows in California

   short period of time is abnormally high, and point to the possibility
   that the technique may be too risky to be used in some situations.}},

Abstract = {{Eggshell removal behavior of American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana)
   and Black-necked Stilts (Himanlopus mexicanus) was studied in northern
   Utah. Both species removed eggshells from their nests soon after
   hatching or whenever they found them there. Both male and female avocets
   exhibited this behavior; female stilts exhibited it (and males probably
   did also). Although some shells were disposed of by dropping them over
   land, both species tended to carry shells to nearby water and submerge
   them. Eggshell removal is probably an antipredator behavior in avocets
   and stilts. Shell removal behavior occurred throughout the incubation
   period (documented on day 3 through hatching in avocets and day 7
   through hatching in stilts). Observations of avocets indicated shell
   removal at a partially depredated nest, removal of one or more entire
   damaged eggs, and removal of a dead chick.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding population of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) was
   surveyed along the Pacific coast of Baja California from 1991 to 1992.
   All accessible potential breeding sites from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas
   were covered. The 1344 adult Snowy Plovers counted were mostly
   distributed (88\% of the total Baja population) at the four main coastal
   wetland complexes of the peninsula: Bahia San Quintin; Laguna Ojo de
   Liebre and Laguna Guerrero Negro; Laguna San Ignacio; and Bahia
   Magdalena. The habitats harboring the largest numbers of birds were
   barrier beaches and salt flats. It is concluded that the number of Snowy
   PIovers on the peninsula of Baja California likely represents at least
   50\% of the total population nesting on the west coast of North America.}},

Abstract = {{It appears that both adult and nestling pipits (Anthus spp.) use grit
   for the mechanical breakdown of seeds and insects. Pipits in temperate
   regions have larger amounts of seed in their diets during fall and
   winter than during the summer, and apparently take more grit then than
   during the summer to help grind the seeds. Grit is also used for its
   mineral content, which is needed for growth and maintenance of both
   young and adults. Larger quantities of grit in nestlings than in adults
   during the summer, when the diet consists of insects, suggests that the
   mineral content is particularly important for nestling development. Grit
   may also be used for egg shell formation, but there was no significant
   difference in the mean quantity of grit per gizzard in both sexes of the
   American Pipit (Anthus rubescens). The possibility that females take
   grit particularly rich in calcium during egg laying could not be
   ascertained. Pipits thus take grit for different reasons throughout the
   year, and they may take it in different quantities depending on why it
   is needed at any one time.}},

Abstract = {{Using criteria described by Pitts (1985), three observers used shape and
   color of the tenth primary wing coverts of 328 Eastern Bluebirds, Sialia
   sialis, to assess the accuracy and inter-observer consistency of these
   aging criteria. Independent scores were identical for 73.5\% of all
   birds from which coverts were collected, with significantly higher
   concordance for males than for females. Collective discussion of each
   feature in dispute resulted in agreement on 92.1\% of the individuals.
   Independent scoring of coverts from 28 known-age females and 27
   known-age males resulted in mean accuracy rates of 78.6\% and 86.4\%,
   respectively. Following discussion of contested scores, observers
   arrived at a consensus evaluation on all but one individual. For
   consensus scores, observers correctly aged 96.3\% of males and 89.3\% of
   females. These results indicate that aging criteria are accurate for
   male Eastern Bluebirds with the standard required for recommendation by
   the Canadian Wildlife Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1977),
   but aging of females using these criteria is not as reliable. For
   studies in which accurate determination of the age of female Eastern
   Bluebirds is critical and in which independent estimates of age from
   banding data are not available, it is suggested that researchers collect
   coverts for aging and have multiple observers assign the individuals to
   age categories.}},

   (Molothrus ater) were observed. In two of these cases the cowbird eggs
   disappeared from the nest within 48 h of their appearance, whereas in
   the third case, the entire nest was destroyed by a severe storm within
   24 h of parasitism. Additionally, cowbird eggs were placed in three T.
   forficata nests, and in all three cases the cowbird eggs disappeared
   within 72 h of their introduction whereas the host eggs remained intact.

Abstract = {{Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) breeding on Rent Island,
   New Brunswick, Canada, are polygynous and sexually dimorphic in size.
   The sex of 7-d-old nestlings cannot be reliably identified by size
   alone, but juveniles begin to display clear sexual dimorphism in size by
   the time they reach independence, several weeks after leaving the nest.
   On average, juvenile males weigh 11\% more and have 6\% longer wings
   than juvenile females. A discriminant function analysis using wing
   length and mass correctly classified as male or female 94\% of
   juveniles, whose sex was later confirmed when they returned to breed as
   yearlings. juvenile population sex ratio did not differ significantly
   from 1:1 in any year of the 4-yr study, and return rates of juveniles
   were independent of sex. The consistently female-biased adult sex ratio
   in this population must therefore be due to the failure of some
   returning males to establish a permanent territory, the influx of young
   females from other populations, or greater mortality of males (compared
   to females) after 1 yr of age.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of back-mounted radio transmitters on reproductive effort
   and return rates of pre-nesting pairs and incubating female Wood Ducks
   (Air sponsa) were investigated. Twenty of 22 pre-nesting pairs remained
   together after capture and radio-marking, but only two females from
   radio-marked pairs attempted to incubate, and none were captured in nest
   boxes during the subsequent 2-3 breeding seasons. Nest success, duckling
   survival and return rates did not differ significantly between a sample
   of females radio-marked during incubation and those leg-banded only, but
   statistical power was low (0.11-0.32). Detrimental effects of
   back-mounted radio transmitters may preclude their use in studies of
   pre-nesting Wood Duck pairs, but back-mounted transmitters appear to
   have minimal effects on incubating and brood-rearing females.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of blood sampling on juvenile Buff-breasted Sandpipers
   (Tryngites subruficollis) was evaluated by comparing movements, mass,
   and survival of 10 broods (37 chicks) that were bled and eight broods
   (31 chicks) that were not bled. Blood was sampled from the jugular vein
   of chicks when they weighed 9.1 +/- 0.9 g ((x) over bar +/- SD) on or
   within 1 d of hatch. Chicks showed few short-term negative effects from
   blood sampling. individual chicks suffered little physical injury, and
   five of eight chicks where injury occurred (i.e., hematomas formed)
   survived to fledging. Further-more, bled broods gained mass at a
   comparable rate during the first 5 d post-hatch, and were resighted at
   similar frequencies as broods that were not bled. Bled broods moved
   slightly longer distances than control broods 1 d after hatch, however.
   This increased activity may have been stress-induced, but was only
   temporary; bled and control broods made similar long-term movements, and
   the probability of resighting was similar at fledging. with the proper
   precautions, it appears that Buff-breasted Sandpiper young can be safely
   sampled for blood at an early age without causing undue harm.}},

Abstract = {{Mass loss and wear of sizes 4A and 5 bands on male and female Laughing
   Gulls (Larus atricilla) collected at John F. Kennedy International
   Airport, New York in 1991-1993 were analyzed. For band size 4A, there
   were significant differences in band mass between sexes for ages 2-6 yr.
   Bands on females lost a mean of 51 mg of mass per year (7.6\% of
   original mass), greater than the 46 mg (6.8\%) per year for bands on
   males. At age 6, size 4A bands on females averaged 2.43 numerals (of
   eight) showing edge wear compared to 0.68 numerals for males. In
   contrast to the findings for band size 4A on gulls 2-6 yr old, no
   significant differences in band mass or numeral wear were noted between
   sexes for band size 5 on gulls 7-8 yr old. The rate of mass loss for
   size 5 bands for years 6-8 (49 mg per year) is intermediate to that for
   size LW bands on males and females for years 2-6. At age 8, size 5 bands
   averaged 45.0\% of their original mass. The significantly smaller
   diameters of female tarsi compared to males probably allowed size 4A
   bands to move and abrade more freely, causing the difference in band
   wear between Laughing Gull sexes. That no differences in wear were
   detected between sexes in size 5 bands might be related to these larger
   diameter bands allowing for equal movement on the tarsi of males and
   females. Extensive band loss for Laughing Gulls banded as chicks should
   begin at about age 9 or 10. Females wearing size 4A bands should begin
   losing bands 1 or 2 yr earlier than males.}},

Abstract = {{Gull aggregation sites in Maine were survived by volunteers 22 Feb.-19
   Mar. 1985-1987 to study differences in foraging site preferences between
   Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L.
   marinus). Proportionately more Great Black-backed Gulls occurred at
   human-made versus natural food sources and at sites with small total
   gull populations. The proportion of Great Black-backed Gulls at sites
   decreased as distance from coast increased. Numbers of Herring Gulls
   were positively correlated with an index of the size of the human-made
   food supply at foraging sites but numbers of Great Black-backed Gulls
   were not. These results suggest that Herring Gull populations may have
   increased more rapidly than Great Black-backed Gull populations in the
   eastern U.S. over the last 60 yr because Herring Gulls have exploited
   human-produced food sources more readily than Great Black-backed Gulls.
   Results corroborate other evidence showing that Great Black-backed Gulls
   are more strongly restricted to a coastal distribution than are Herring
   Gulls, though the reasons why this might be so are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Two tropical vireonids (Hylophilus o. ochraceiceps and H. d.
   `'decurtatus'') and two furnariids (Xenops minutus mexicanus and
   Automolus ochrolaemus cervinigularis) were examined using external
   measurements of museum specimens.  All four species are sexually
   monochromatic. Degrees of sexual dimorphism are described, and
   discriminant equations are presented as a method for determining the sex
   of captured birds.  Correct use of these equations is discussed. Clues
   to aging are offered when possible; juvenal plumages are summarized. In
   all four species males are larger than females in wing and tail lengths,
   but no significant differences were found in body mass.  Tarsus length
   is longer in male A. ochrolaemus, and probably shorter in male H.
   ochraceiceps. Bill length is longer in male H. decurtatus At present
   there are no functional explanations for the observed dimorphisms. The
   congeneric vireonids, which show geographic and some habitat overlap,
   show very little overlap in morphological space.}},

Abstract = {{Vocalizations have the potential to allow the identification of
   individual birds. The practicalities of the technique were assessed for
   European Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) and Black-throated Divers (Gavia
   arctica), two species that present different monitoring problems. The
   diurnal and seasonal pattern of booming behavior is predictable for
   bitterns; the less predictable pattern of Black-throated Diver
   vocalizations proved a significant limitation on the usefulness of the
   technique with this species. Spectrograms of the yodel vocalization of
   Black-throated Divers showed clear qualitative. differences between
   individuals, whereas quantitative analysis of bittern booms was required
   to demonstrate individual distinctiveness. Within- and between-year
   identification of bitterns is complicated by a degree of variability in
   boom structure of some birds, but bitterns with relatively more stable
   booms were successfully re-identified. Black-throated Diver yodels
   showed striking between-year similarity. The factors that affect and
   limit the success of vocal individuality as an alternative to more
   conventional marking techniques are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) from at least eight breeding colonies
   in the north-eastern United States disperse to southern Maine each
   August before migrating to their wintering quarters. Peak numbers of
   terns are recorded in mid-August, and during this time daily counts may
   exceed 200 adults and 100 juveniles on Stratton Island. Roseate Terns
   use the island as a loafing and roosting site and feed in the
   surrounding waters of Saco Bay during the day. From 1989 to 1992, 193
   individual adults and 31 fledglings were identified by observing
   color-band combinations and reading numbers on leg bands. Length of stay
   varied among individual terns and years and ranged from 1 to 26 d. Using
   appropriate Jolly-Seber sighting-resighting models it was estimated that
   5-10\% of all breeding adult Roseate Terns in the northeastern U.S.
   disperse to Stratton Island each August. During this post-breeding
   period, juvenile terns practice fishing for themselves but are still
   dependent on their parents for food. In 2 yr of study, adults fed
   fledglings sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) exclusively. It is suggested that
   Roseate Terns disperse to Stratton Island each August because of the
   availability of sand lance in Saco Bay}},

Abstract = {{The Red-cockaded Woodpecker population on the Sam Houston National
   Forest in Texas was surveyed during 1988. The 128 active clusters
   present make this population one of the largest in existence. Pine stand
   ages varied considerably across the forest. Correlation analysis
   indicated that stand area in excess of 60 yr of age is positively
   correlated with measures of woodpecker density. This relationship is
   present across a range of areas from individual compartments (= 520 ha)
   to blocks of 10-15 compartments. A positive correlation of area in pines
   of 60 yr of age and number of woodpeckers per group suggests that the
   causes of these relationships are still operating. It is hypothesized
   that the fragmentation of forest in excess of 60 vr of age by younger
   stands is impacting the demographics of this population.}},

   suggested that birds of divergent breeding populations mix at wintering
   sites. There was little interchange of birds across the Rocky Mountains.

   the existence of a geographic source of Cedar Waxwings that may damage
   early ripening fruits such as blueberries in Florida.}},

   with 54 taxa identified in 1 mo. Only 23 species occurred regularly over
   a series of months, and their patterns of wetland use varied markedly by
   species and season. The wetland complex served different functions for
   different species, but most used the area for migration stops and
   wintering. Eleven species were considered breeders in the brackish
   marsh, but another 33 species probably nested in nearby freshwater
   wetlands, coastal islands or in shrubs or small trees, and fed or rested
   in the marsh. Such coastal areas are used by birds year-round and, in
   addition to protection, need management strategies to ensure habitat
   diversity and normal water regimes which will maintain natural bird
   diversity and serve all species for different life stages.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 62 Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) females were captured at
   their nests in eastern South Dakota during 1990 and 1991. Females were
   captured on an island, a peninsula cut off from the mainland by
   excavation, and a peninsula protected by an electric fence that deters
   mammals. Loop harnesses were used to attach radio transmitters to
   females to evaluate possible effects of marking females on survival of
   their ducklings and to determine the influence of brood rearing on
   female survival. No difference was found in duckling (P = 0.999) or
   brood (P = 0.458) (e.g., one or more ducklings alive in brood) survival
   to 7 d for females marked from 1 d prior to hatch to immediately post
   hatch (still in nest) compared with those marked at 3-9 d before hatch
   (P = 0.081). There also were no differences in survival by age class
   between marked broods that did not suffer total mortality and unmarked
   broods (P > 0.05). If survival of broods was influenced by harness
   attachments on females, it likely occurred in females suffering total
   brood loss early in brood rearing. Marked females with broods had poorer
   survival to 21 d than marked females that had lost or abandoned their
   clutches or broods (73.5\% vs. 100\%, P < 0.001).}},

Abstract = {{Active nests of passerine hosts of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus
   ater) were examined from 1982 to 1987 along the Colorado River in Grand
   Canyon National Park, Arizona, to examine rates of brood parasitism and
   to determine cowbird nesting chronology relative to host nesting
   chronology. Eight of 16 (50\%) species and 37 of 207 (17.9\%) nests were
   parasitized. Nests of Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), Common
   Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and Blue Grosbeak (Guiraca caerulea)
   experienced at least 50\% cowbird parasitism. Overall rates of
   parasitism differed among years (range = 3.3-30.4\%/yr; P = 0.017). The
   cowbird nesting season extended from 6 May to 18 july, with a peak from
   mid-May to mid-june when 86\% of cowbird eggs were laid. Passerine hosts
   whose peak nesting coincided with cowbird peak nesting exhibited
   relatively high rates of brood parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{The autumn migration of 110 species or distinct races of birds was
   monitored from 1976 to 1986 by a standardized mist-netting program on
   the coast of central California. A peak in migration numbers occurred
   between mid-August and late October in a given year. Young birds were
   captured 9.1 times more frequently than adults. The number of birds
   banded annually in the autumn was not correlated with the number banded
   in the summer. There was no correlation between the number of young and
   adult birds banded in a given year. The 44 most common bird taxa had
   high annual variation in numbers and young:adult ratios, sometimes by a
   factor >10. The young:adult ratios were higher for species of woodland
   habitat, breeders along the coast and interior mountains of California,
   and much higher for neotropical migrants and permanent residents with a
   winter influx of individuals. Adults of species breeding in California
   mountains varied greatly in annual capture rates. The high annual
   variation emphazies that long-term studies are necessary to understand
   the importance of an area to individual or groups of species during
   migration periods. A higher diversity of species and greater number of
   individuals were captured during autumn than summer, and habitat along
   migratory routes may be as essential as breeding and wintering habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of Common Poorwills (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii) was
   studied from 1989 to 1992 in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia and
   1991 to 1992 in the Cypress Hills of Saskatchewan, Canada. Individuals
   were captured by luring them into mist nets using song playbacks. Data
   were collected from a total of 27 nests (from 17 pairs), found by
   following birds outfitted with radio transmitters. Poorwills arrived
   from mid-April to late May. Four of five pairs in British Columbia and
   two of three pairs in Saskatchewan made two nesting attempts each.
   Poorwills appeared to be monogamous and the pair bond, with one
   exception, was maintained throughout the breeding season. First clutches
   were laid from late May to late June and second clutches from early July
   to early August. Nest initiation was approximately 2 wk earlier in
   British Columbia than in Saskatchewan. Twenty-six of 27 clutches
   consisted of two eggs. Both male and female birds shared incubating and
   brooding responsibilities, although males were found incubating
   significantly more often, whereas females brooded significantly more.
   The incubation period was 20-21 d. Hatching success was 63\% in British
   Columbia and 71\% in Saskatchewan. The nestling period was 20-22 d.
   Fledging success was 8\% and 30\% for British Columbia and Saskatchewan,
   respectively. Predation appeared to be the most important factor
   limiting reproductive success.}},

   data of 223 individuals caught between 1982 and 1985. The proportion of
   adults and juveniles in the sample did not follow a regular pattern,

   month, adult females outnumbered the males, indicating partial spatial
   segregation of the sexes. Analysis of variance of body mass demonstrates
   the presence of two groups of migrants in the area. Birds arriving in
   August use the Bay as a stopover site until late November, when a second

Abstract = {{This paper examines the impact of different types of predator exclosures
   on Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) nest abandonment. The data were
   obtained from state or provincial agencies. Of the 211 exclosed nests
   sampled, only 22 (10\%) were abandoned. The impact of three types of
   independent variables on nest abandonment was evaluated: the process of
   exclosure construction (e.g., construction time, time elapsed before
   re-incubation), the design characteristics (e.g., size, shape,
   construction materials) and geographic location. The exclosure
   construction process was not related to nest abandonment. Exclosure
   size, shape, mesh size and fence height were also not significant. The
   odds of nest abandonment, however, were significantly higher for covered
   exclosures and those lacking fence posts. In addition, exclosures in
   northern climes had significantly higher levels of nest abandonment.
   Design recommendations are suggested for the use of exclosures.}},

Abstract = {{Aebischer and Robertson (1993) suggest compositional analysis as a
   preferred substitute for pre-existing, alternative techniques that
   examine     resource use and selection. It is revealed how their
   proposed use violates basic prerequisites of statistical inference
   because information `'packets'' are based on fallacious sample units
   with no known statistical or biological target population. Compositional
   analysis is neither suitable nor necessary for sample variables (whole
   integers) obtained from enumerated data, the performance of this
   technique (under different conditions and relative to alternatives) has
   not yet been evaluated, and the sample sizes used to advocate it were,
   by the authors' own admission, `'borderline.'' A distinction is made
   between inherent assumptions of statistical techniques per se and
   weaknesses of biological data employed in those techniques; the latter
   do not automatically invalidate the former. Attention is drawn to
   sources that will enable the field ornithologist and statistical
   practitioner to choose among several tests that address resource
   selection in the widest sense, thereby finding the best match to his/her
   data structure, biological hypothesis of interest, the logistical
   constraints of field studies and the behavior of the animal population
   being studied.}},

Abstract = {{The historical use of bamboo/cane as blackbird and starling roosting
   habitat was analyzed from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service roost survey
   reports to assess the potential for shifting roosting populations away
   from objectionable urban sites where there may be nuisance or human
   health concerns. The following criteria were used to assess this
   potential: (1) frequent historical use by blackbirds and starlings
   compared with other habitat; (2) history of accommodating high bird
   densities on a limited area compared with other habitat; (3) history of
   repeated localized utilization by roosting blackbirds and starlings; (4)
   history of utilization over a wide geographic range; and (5) history of
   occupation by starlings and all major blackbird species. Of the diverse
   habitat historically reported to be used by wintering blackbirds and
   starlings for roosting, bamboo/cane uniquely appeared to meet all
   criteria as a widely used habitat that supports maximum densities of all
   primary roosting species. The possible ecological attractiveness of
   bamboo/cane as roosting habitat is discussed. Although the data are
   lacking to suggest that cane is sufficiently attractive to shift
   roosting behavior of blackbirds and starlings from objectionable sites,
   bamboo/cane is clearly a candidate for further research into this
   concept.}},

Abstract = {{The Brown Trembler (Cinclocerthia ruficauda), one of the endemic Mimidae
   of the Lesser Antilles, has a conspicuous and frequent habit of
   trembling its wings, the behavior for which it is named. Trembling
   consists of a perched bird drooping both wings 1-2 cm, then quickly
   raising them back to a normal position several times in rapid
   succession. Each `'tremble'' takes approximately 1 s. In this study,
   Brown Tremblers were observed and frequency of trembling was measured in
   March 1991, on Dominica. The rate of trembling was significantly
   different in different social contexts. Solitary, singing Brown
   Tremblers stopped singing and trembled at a mean rate of 1.74/min.
   Solitary Brown Tremblers that were foraging trembled at a mean rate of
   6.8/min. Brown Tremblers foraging or traveling within 2 m of a
   conspecific trembled at a mean rate of 28.6/min, and Brown Tremblers
   involved in a rapid chase, < 0.5 m apart, trembled at a mean rate of
   50.0/min. Solitary Brown Tremblers (n = 31) show a significantly slower
   rate of trembling than social birds (two Brown Tremblers present, n =
   13, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 43). The higher frequency of
   trembling in social contexts supports the hypothesis that trembling is a
   visual intra-specific signal. This interpretation is reinforced by data
   showing that Brown Tremblers almost always trembled immediately upon
   arriving at a new perch, and by the absence of a contact note used by
   Brown Tremblers.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) chose boxes containing old nests in 38
   of 41 instances in which these boxes were paired with empty ones. Other
   species nesting in bluebird boxes chose boxes containing old nests in
   four of five instances. This result conflicts with the prevailing
   opinion that cavity-nesting birds avoid boxes that contain old nests
   and, presumably, high parasite loads. It is suggested that bluebirds
   prefer re-working old nest material to building a completely new nest,
   and/or that choice of boxes with old nests actually enhances parasite
   control because old nests harbor wasp (Nasonia vitripennis) larvae that
   parasitize blood-sucking blowflies (Protocalliphora sialis).}},

Abstract = {{Movements and habitat-use patterns were evaluated for a small population
   (n = 6 pairs) of Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus) nesting near
   Gillette, Wyoming. A total of 2462 falcon relocations was documented
   through telemetry. The average (n = 6) harmonic-mean 95\%-contour
   home-range was 69 km2, whereas the average 75\% contour was 26.6 km2. 
   The convex polygon average home-range size was 29.4 kM2. The average
   95\% and 75\% foraging-area contours, where points less than 500 m from
   the eyrie were excluded, were 11 1.8 km2 and 57.4 km2, respectively. The
   convex polygon foraging area was 74.7 km2. It is believed that the 95\%
   foraging-area contour best represented falcon home ranges as confirmed
   through field observations. Habitat analyses showed that falcons
   selected foraging areas near their nest sites, in areas of open
   grassland, and did not overtly avoid oil wells. Falcons foraged in areas
   with an oil well density of approximately 1.4 wells/km2. These results
   suggested that falcons could tolerate low levels of oil development on
   foraging sites when their eyries were insulated from human disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Two-parameter flow cytometry was used to measure sex differences in
   nuclear DNA content in the Florida Scrub jay (Aphelocoma c.
   coerulescens), a sexually monomorphic, cooperative breeder. Blood
   samples were obtained from 39 individuals, comprising 14 known males, 14
   known females and 11 birds of unknown sex. Although significant
   among-session variation complicated the analysis, the standard estimate
   of genome size for known males (3.159 +/- 0.019 pg DNA per nucleus) was
   significantly larger than that of known females (3.095 +/- 0.019 pg),
   and the distributions of genome size for the two sexes did not overlap.
   Sex of most birds of unknown sex could thereby be assigned
   unambiguously. The mean value for genome size was 3.129 +/- 0.036 pg
   (SD), and intraspecific variation was 4.63\% of the mean (range
   3.195-3.045 pg). Analysis of feather pulp samples, complicated by high
   levels of debris and variability in the fluorescence distributions, was
   improved by use of electronic bitmap gating.  Although flow cytometric
   techniques will probably not allow identification of sex in all cases,
   flow cytometry is nonetheless a potentially useful method for
   determining the sex of live birds.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing a 90-yr trend of northward range expansion through the West
   Indies, the brood parasitic Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis)
   appeared in the Florida Keys in 1985, and was first reported on the
   North American mainland in 1987.  By 1991 the cowbird had been reported
   as far north as Maine, a displacement of 2300 km from its putative
   arrival point on the mainland. Shiny Cowbirds are permanent residents
   south of Tampa, Florida (28-degrees-N). Their numbers in southern
   Florida are augmented in the spring, apparently from the Greater
   Antilles. The cowbirds reinvade areas north of Tampa each spring in an
   explosive pattern. Most sightings have been along the Gulf and Atlantic
   coasts. The cowbirds disappear from the northern part of their range in
   the late autumn. The fat reserves of cowbirds collected in Florida in
   late summer were sufficient for flights greater than 400 km, and it is
   possible that cowbirds return to the Greater Antilles in the winter.
   Long-range movements of Shiny Cowbirds in North America support the
   hypothesis that the cowbird spread from South America unaided by human
   introductions.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) foraging on fruits
   of the nonnative European hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) was studied in
   relation to territory ownership; individuals defending fruit supplies

   territories (intruders). On average, owners had longer feeding bouts,
   ingested more fruits per bout and foraged for fruits more slowly than
   intruders. During the first minute after arrival at a fruit source,
   intruders attempted to pick fruits almost three times as fast and
   ingested twice as many fruits as owners. These results are important
   because most studies discussing differences in foraging behavior between
   owners and intruders have been only anecdotal, and because reports of
   fruit defense are rare.}},

   were examined using mist nets and song counts, Each site was mist-netted
   once, and visited three times for song counts during June and early July
   1991. Mist nets provided an assessment of the understory bird community
   that was similar to that of the song count in terms of overall species
   richness, but quite different with regard to species abundance; song
   counts generally underestimated numbers, occasionally by an order of
   magnitude. Song counts also failed to accurately predict understory
   species composition for seven of 10 sites surveyed. The use of song
   counts appears to be inappropriate for determination of detailed
   information on breeding population dynamics. A combination of mist nets
   and song counts, however, can be used to determine presence/absence,}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the accuracy of a single survey in estimating the resident

   Wisconsin, during 1986 and 1987, by comparing it to estimates obtained
   during an intensive productivity and brood habitat study. On average, we
   located and verified 94\% of the chicks but only 56\% of the territorial
   adults during the single surveys. Determination of territorial adults
   was low because of our inability to classify adults without broods and
   highly variable numbers of nonresident adult loons present. We conclude
   that a single survey on large, multiple-pair lakes is ineffective in
   estimating territorial adult Common Loon populations and will not
   provide accurate trend data, although a single survey conducted when
   chicks are approximately 6-weeks old will yield good estimates of
   fledging success.}},

Abstract = {{Creching of penguin chicks is believed to offer protection from
   predators and or cold weather conditions. An alternative explanation is
   proposed for the close association of Jackass Penguin (Spheniscus
   demersus) chicks. The frequency of creching by Jackass Penguin chicks
   during the pre-independence phase was examined. Unguarded chicks of all
   ages may form creches of 4-11 chicks. Unguarded chicks may be exposed to
   high levels of aggression (maximum mean attack rate 3.8/h, range 0-12)
   from 1-6 adults at a time. Differential attack rates between guarded,
   creching and unguarded chicks, and the response of chicks to attack,
   suggest that creching of unattended chicks may confer protection against
   adult aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Body mass at nest-leaving and subsequent survival, as measured by
   fledgling recapture and recruitment to breeding populations, are
   correlated in many species. The hypothesis that nestling body mass and
   survival are correlated because heavier birds are fatter (i.e., have
   proportionately greater fat stores) than lighter birds was tested by
   comparing the fatness of nestling House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and
   European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) of different body masses. As
   nestling mass and survival after nest-leaving were correlated in the
   wren population but not in the starting population, it was expected that
   the heaviest nestlings would be the fattest in House Wrens but not in
   European Starlings. In neither species were the heaviest nestlings the
   fattest. These and other published results suggest that the correlation
   between body mass and survival is attributable mainly to causes other
   than quantity of relative fat stores, such as differences in degree of
   maturity or competitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of three fixatives (acetic acid, isopropyl alcohol,
   propylene glycol) and carriers (petroleum jelly, vegetable shortening,
   an oil-based silica gel) for improving retention of Rhodamine B (RB),
   Malachite Green (MG) and Picric Acid (PA) dyes by feathers were
   evaluated to develop a mixture suitable for marking incubating Herring
   Gulls (Larus argentatus) via application to their eggs. Isopropyl
   alcohol improved feather retention of RB and PA significantly more than
   propylene glycol. Propylene glycol improved retention of MG
   significantly more than isopropyl alcohol. Overall, silica gel-based dye
   mixtures had significantly greater retention by feathers than petroleum
   jelly-based mixtures. Color-marks on gulls with RB and silica get were
   also more visible with greater retention than marks on gulls with RB and
   petroleum jelly. Application of the carriers to domestic chicken eggs
   during day 1 or 11 of incubation, however, caused 100\% embryonic
   mortality.  Hatch success of gull clutches was also significantly
   reduced by direct application of dye to gull eggs or to dummy eggs
   placed in nests for 24 h.  To improve longevity of color marks via
   application of dyes to eggs, use of an oil-based silica gel as the dye
   carrier is recommended, as is use of a dummy egg or marking only 1 egg
   of a clutch late in incubation to reduce mortality. To improve dye
   retention via topical application, solutions of 35\% isopropyl alcohol
   with RB and PA and 99\% propylene glycol with MG are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Stomach contents of migrating Cinnamon Teal (Anas cyanoptera) from four
   plant zones on Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico
   were studied. Cinnamon Teal consumed more animal than plant foods
   (expressed as percentage dry mass) during spring migration but more
   plant than animal foods during fall migration. Animal food consumption
   was greatest in Cinnamon Teal collected from alkali (Scirpus
   maritimus)-three-square bulrush (S. americanus) and saltgrass
   (Distichlis stricta) habitats; plant consumption was highest in ducks
   collected from habitat dominated by annuals including smartweeds
   (Polygonum spp.), wild millets (Echinochloa spp.) and sprangletop
   (Leptochloa fascicularis), and by cattail (Typha spp.)-hardstem bulrush
   (S. acutus) habitats during spring and fall migration. Chironomid larvae
   were the dominant animal consumed during spring migration; gastropods
   were the major animal consumed during fall migration. Seeds were
   dominant among plant materials in stomachs during both spring and fall
   migration and usually were from the major plant species found within the
   zone where the bird was collected. During spring, there was no
   difference in animal foods and molt rank among habitat types.}},

   smaller than those from Florida (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.004). A new
   discriminant function, based on bill, total body and wing lengths, that
   correctly classified the sex of 92\% of gulls collected in New York was
   derived. These findings support past studies that suggest a discriminant

   hatch-year and second-year Palila from after-second-year birds. Adult
   male Palila are distinguished from females by a distinct napeline and
   <30\% gray feathers intermixed with yellow feathers on the head. The
   black or gray feathers of the lores and chin of males are darker than
   those on the back, whereas the lores and chin of females are lighter or

Abstract = {{Growth and survival rates of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus) were
   monitored using radiotelemetry from hatching until birds left the
   breeding grounds on the Pawnee National Grassland, Weld County,
   Colorado. Chick weights increased logarithmically (r = 0.961) and tarsus
   length linearly (r = 0.948) with age. Using the average fledging weight
   of 69.8 g and an age/weight regression we predicted that the average age
   at fledging was 36 d.
   Fourteen Mountain Plover nests each had three eggs; an average of 2.6
   eggs hatched in seven nests, whereas remaining nests were lost to
   predation, storms, or trampling by a cow. Twenty-four adult Mountain
   Plovers were monitored for 275 telemetry days with no mortalities.
   Twenty flightless chicks had a calculated daily survival rate of 0.979
   for 233 telemetry-days. Mortalities of flightless chicks were due to
   predation or unknown causes. The daily survival rate predicted that 1.2
   of the 2.6 chicks hatched per nest lived to fly. Eight fledged chicks
   were monitored for 74 telemetry-days, with a daily survival rate of
   0.974. Mortalities of fledglings were all attributed to predation. The
   combined survival rates predicted that 0.7 of the 2.6 hatched chicks
   lived to leave the nesting area. Survival rates of flightless chicks
   were similar to those reported 20 yr ago, implying that recent declines
   in Mountain Plover numbers on the continent are not attributable to
   either longer-term declines in nesting productivity or phenomena
   occurring at non-breeding locales.}},

Abstract = {{Attention to long-term declines in populations of Neotropical migratory
   birds has generated increased interest in how to monitor and manage
   them.  Measurement of nesting success provides information on trends in
   recruitment, and measurement of vegetation associated with nests may
   identify habitat influences on breeding productivity.  Examination of
   nests also allows collection of life history data (e.g., clutch size,
   numbers of broods, numbers of nesting attempts, nesting success), which
   provide important insight into vulnerability of species to decimation or
   pertubations.  Comparisons of nesting success and habitat use across the
   geographic range of a species can determine local habitat effects on
   population recruitment and historical constraints on habitat use and
   species distributions. In this paper, standardized methods and cues are
   described that aid in locating and monitoring nests to allow comparisons
   across studies in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) have been seen in Cuba as early as
   the 1800s. There are at least 14 known records of the Piping Plover in
   the Cuban archipelago for the period 1965-1992. The number of
   individuals seen ranged from 1 to 25 with most sightings made on Cuba's
   northern keys in the Sabana and Camaguey archipelagos. A cursory
   evaluation of Cuba's insular habitats, through limited surveys and
   examination of coastal relief and vegetation maps, suggests that Cuba is
   marginally suitable for wintering Piping Plovers. Habitats in some of
   the northern keys may be more suitable. Additional surveys are required
   to confirm this evaluation. Currently, the status of the Piping Plover
   in Cuba appears to be that of a rare winter visitor.}},

Abstract = {{Gut morphology and body condition of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) and Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) were evaluated in
   relation to winter diet quality. When common broomweed (Xanthocephalum
   dracunculoides) seeds were available, Bobwhite (n = 58) and Scaled Quail
   (n = 69) consumed significantly less green vegetation and significantly
   more broomweed seeds. Of available foods, common broomweed seeds had the
   highest energy content per gram because of relatively high (25\%) lipid
   content. Quail with high energy diets had significantly shorter small
   intestines (both species) and ceca (Scaled Quail) than quail consuming
   relatively low energy foods. It is postulated that Bobwhite and Scaled
   Quail that did not have access to high energy food (common broomweed
   seeds) increased intake of low energy food (green vegetation) to meet
   nutritional demands and thus expressed intestinal (both species) and
   cecal (Scaled Quail) hypertrophy. Scaled Quail feeding on low energy
   diets had significantly heavier livers and had levels of body fat
   similar to Scaled Quail with access to high energy foods. Bobwhite
   consuming low energy foods had similar liver masses and were unable to
   accumulate as much body fat as Bobwhite foraging on high energy diets.
   Scaled Quail seem more capable than Northern Bobwhite in adjusting
   digestive organs to extract energy and accumulate lipid reserves when
   seed availability is restricted.}},

   (58,196 of 146,012), 15\% (19,406 of 127,378) and 49\% (54,626 of

   Northeast Laughing Gulls was initiated in October. Northeast Laughing
   Gulls migrated greater distances and were recovered farther south during
   winter than Gulf Coast gulls. Significantly more Gulf Coast Laughing
   Gulls wintered along the Gulf Coast than did Northeast Laughing Gulls.
   In contrast, significantly more Northeast Laughing Gulls wintered in
   Central and South America. Adult Laughing Gulls returned to breeding
   areas between March and May. Sixty-four percent of adult recoveries
   during subsequent breeding seasons were within 50 km of their natal
   banding locations. Significantly more Laughing Gulls were recovered
   north of their natal banding location than south during subsequent
   breeding seasons. Autumn dispersal of hatching-year Laughing Gulls was

Abstract = {{Distribution and trends in abundance of Rough-legged Hawks (Buteo
   lagopus) wintering in California were assessed using Christmas Bird
   Counts (CBCs). Data from 114 individual CBCs conducted in California
   over 40 yr during the winters of 1949-1950 to 1988-1989 were used. The
   percentage of CBCs with Rough-legged Hawks, average number of hawks/CBC,
   and average number of hawks/160 party-km/CBC were positively correlated
   with year (P < 0.0001) over the 40-yr period. The frequency distribution
   of intervals between statewide population peaks differed significantly
   (P < 0.001) from a random pattern, and was not significantly different
   (P > 0.75) from a 4-yr cycle.  These results indicated that the peaks in
   wintering populations of Rough-legged Hawks are more cyclic than
   irregular. Rough-legged Hawk numbers were significantly (P < 0.001)
   different among eight geographic regions in California, and the greatest
   numbers of hawks were found in the North Interior and North and South
   Sierra Nevada regions. Significant positive correlations (P < 0.05) were
   found for average number of hawks/CBC and average number of hawks/160
   party-km/CBC with year in all geographic regions except the North Sierra
   (both variables) and Central Coast (average number/CBC).}},

   whose nests were found vs. those that were not located, (2) proportion
   of broodless hens on an intensively studied area vs. an area that was
   not studied, (3) the proximity of nest flags for successful vs.
   depredated nests. A new technique was developed to compare rates of
   visits and types of nest checks between successful and depredated nests.
   This method controlled for period under observation and stage of
   breeding. Methods for minimizing investigator disturbance are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in estimates of shorebird abundance derived from four
   sequential 30-min counts conducted at Humboldt Bay, California during
   November 1990 and February 1991 was estimated. The November survey was
   scheduled so that the first of four consecutive 30-min counts occurred
   when the tide had just inundated intertidal habitats, whereas inundation
   occurred during or just after the last of four February counts. Percent
   bias was normally high (15-78\%) in both counts when compared with the
   maximum count of selected shorebird species or groups. Compared with
   November counts, those in February varied less and peaked during the
   penultimate and last count. These findings suggest that multiple counts
   are more useful than single surveys, especially to identify optimal
   observation times relative to inundation of intertidal flats. Data from
   multiple surveys offer at least two potential ways of estimating
   shorebird abundance: average (or median) estimates and single, maximum
   estimates.}},

   where birds are fed elicited reports of one or more bird deaths from
   1165 people. In the sample of respondents, 0.85 birds/house/winter died
   through striking windows. This figure is probably high because the
   people sampled were avid bird-feeders who attract birds close to
   windows. On the other hand, many cases of window strike deaths probably
   go unnoticed. Taking such considerations into account, the data support
   a previous estimate of 1-10 birds killed annually for every building in
   North America. Birds died from window strikes approximately in
   proportion to their abundance at feeders, and panic flights were
   implicated in a large proportion of strikes. The best proven solution is
   screening of windows.}},

Abstract = {{Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) nests constructed in sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata) and greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) shrubs
   contained different proportions (by weight) of nest material of
   different thicknesses. Nests constructed in dense greasewood shrubs
   contained fewer medium and large sticks, typically used in construction
   of the nest substructure, than nests built in relatively open sagebrush.
   In contrast, there was no difference in quantity of lining-fibers,
   twigs, and small sticks used in nests constructed in these shrubs. These
   differences can be attributed to different nest-stabilization
   requirements imposed on breeding shrikes by structurally dissimilar
   nesting substrates and imply plasticity in shrike nest-building
   behavior.}},

   examined. Prior to widespread nesting in New England beginning in the
   1970s the species was a rare vagrant in spring and autumn. Significant
   differences were observed between seasons in the frequency of occurrence
   of vagrants at coastal and inland sites from 1937 to 1960. Coastal
   reports predominated in both seasons but inland reports were more
   frequent in spring. It is proposed that spring vagrants overshot the

   vagrancy does not presage range expansion whereas an increase in spring

Abstract = {{Nests and nest sites of the San Miguel Island (SMI) Song Sparrow
   (Melospiza melodia micronyx) are described; nests are compared with
   those of 16 other races of Song Sparrows. Bush lupins (Lupinus
   albifrons), coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis) and golden bush
   (Haplopappus venetus) were the shrubs used most commonly as nest sites
   by Song Sparrows on SMI. As a result of its location, the nest was
   effectively concealed from gray foxes (Urocyon littoralis), the major
   predator of this sparrow. Nest and nest site also moderated the combined
   chilling effects of cool air temperatures and strong northwesterly winds
   on the eggs and nestlings. Even in the absence of these moderating
   effects of the nest site, the energetic cost of incubation, estimated at
   41-53\% of the sparrow's resting metabolic rate, was modest. Twenty-nine
   percent of the canopy above the nest was open and as much as 73\% of the
   nest cup was in the sun at midday, a time when surface temperatures of
   foliage, nest and nestlings sometimes exceeded 40 C. Whereas this
   exposure did not apparently reduce fledging success, it may explain why
   the incidence of addled eggs was so high in this population of Song
   Sparrows compared to others. Significant differences existed among races
   of Song Sparrows in the size, porosity and insulation of the nest. In
   most cases, these differences were not related to the latitude of the
   races' nesting areas.}},

Abstract = {{Shorebirds (Charadrii) were censused for a year at weekly to biweekly
   intervals along an approximately 1-km transect on an Oso Bay tidal
   mudflat surrounding Ward Island, Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas. A
   total of 34,822 shorebirds of 26 species were observed and categorized
   by their use of three microhabitats. The greatest shorebird use of the
   area occurred during the winter and early spring (January-March) in
   south Texas, but the highest species diversity was recorded during the
   peak of fall migration (September-October). Low shorebird abundance and
   diversity were observed during the summer. Of the four most common
   species in the study area, Dunlins (Calidris alpina) and dowitchers
   (Limnodromus spp.) exhibited the greatest similarity in their habitat
   preferences. Shorebirds were less restricted to microhabitats during the
   winter when food resources were likely highest. It is suggested that the
   abundance of food and feeding habitat along the Texas coast during the
   winter and early spring may have been a factor in the evolution of
   circular migratory patterns in many shorebird species.}},

Abstract = {{The diets of 420 Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were
   studied during November 1986-March 1987 on eight public reservoirs in
   Texas. Prey included 29 fish species and the mean live weight of fish
   per bird was 122 g. Fishes less-than-or-equal-to 415 mm long were
   ingested, but those less-than-or-equal-to 125 mm accounted for 90\% of
   cormorant food contents by number. Shad (Dorosoma spp.) and sunfishes
   (Lepomis spp.) accounted for 90\% of the total food items by number.
   Consumption of fishes (percent by weight) was different for male vs.
   female and adult vs. juvenile cormorants. Total consumption of fish by
   weight was consistent throughout the period; however, fewer but much
   larger fish were consumed after 15 February. Cormorants ate fishes that
   were most abundant in reservoirs. Sport fishes made up a substantial
   portion of cormorant food by weight, but not by number on some
   reservoirs. Cormorants ate very few large sport fish, however.}},

Abstract = {{Foot-loss rates as high as 50\% associated with leg banding have been
   reported for some shorebirds. Foot loss in a banded population of
   Spotted Sandpipers (Actitis macularia) was studied over 19 yr. A total
   of 267 banded birds were seen in at least one subsequent year,
   representing 774 bird years. Seven of 267 banded birds (2.6\%) lost one
   foot in years following banding. One additional banded bird lost a toe.
   Three unbanded birds missing feet and one missing a toe were also noted.
   Of the seven banded birds missing feet, six lost the foot on the side
   with the aluminum band. Assuming foot loss was independent of the
   aluminum band, the probability of observing at least six of seven losses
   on the aluminum-banded side is 0.013 (binomial test). A plastic colored
   leg band caused toe loss on one bird. It is concluded that banding
   Spotted Sandpipers probably caused little harm to this population.
   Individual harm usually was associated with the aluminum band.}},

Abstract = {{Prey-size selection by Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) feeding on an
   intertidal polychaete was investigated to determine how different
   substrate conditions affect the foraging of Whimbrels feeding on an
   intertidal mudflat. Whimbrels preying almost exclusively on large
   polychaetes (Perinereis gualpensis) in an estuarine mudflat in Chile
   (Queule River estuary 39-degrees 20'S, 73-degrees 13'W) were studied.
   Birds were highly selective: the average prey size found on droppings
   was 53.6 +/- 3.7 SE (n = 914) mm total body length, and 95\% of them
   were larger than 40 mm. Whimbrels obtained their prey almost exclusively
   by deep probing because large worms were found mainly at depths below 3
   cm in the substrate. Observations of feeding Whimbrels were made in five
   sediment conditions: (1) shallow water, sediment covered by a 2-10 cm
   water layer; (2) water film, sediment covered by a water film <2 cm
   deep; (3) wet sand with no water layer; (4) dry sand; and (5) mud.
   Foraging was significantly more successful in sandy areas than in muddy
   areas. This result corresponded with an observed lower density of large
   polychaetes (>40 mm) in the mud. Within sandy areas Whimbrels had the
   highest foraging success rate in wet sand. Wet sand was suspected to be
   optimal for visual detection of prey because, in water-covered
   sediments, water movement probably interfered with visual detection of
   prey. Whimbrels did not feed in dry sand, which suggested that prey were
   not detectable or were unavailable to the birds due to burrowing depth
   and increase in sediment compaction.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty-one records of the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) in the coastal
   southeastern United States (Maryland-Texas, through spring 1991) that
   were mostly subsequent to a compilation of records by Clapp et al.
   (1983) are summarized, and a re-analysis of the 81 total regional
   records (excluding eight questionable reports) is presented. Data are
   provided on 11 specimen records. There are still no acceptable records
   for Alabama, Mississippi or Texas, and only sight records for Maryland
   and South Carolina. This summary supports the findings of Clapp et al.
   (1983) in that the majority (88\%) of records are from spring, and that
   fall migration through the region is very limited (12\%; no fall
   specimens or photographs). Spring migration is generally later and more
   protracted than previously indicated. The scarcity of Arctic Terns in
   fall is attributed to the clockwise Atlantic migration route. The
   species' relative rarity in spring may result from migration routes that
   are well-offshore and largely bypass the recessed coast of the
   southeastern U.S.; June and July birds found along the northern Gulf
   Coast probably strayed and became `'trapped'' in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Caution in the identification of Arctic Terns, and in the evaluation of
   all (especially early spring) records of this species from the
   southeastern U.S., is advocated.}},

   During the first week after fledging and before hunting began, kestrels
   spent substantial amounts of time perched on the ground along the
   interstate right-of-way and in row-crop fields. All but one of the 16
   kestrels found dead died during the first week after they fledged,
   before their flying skills had developed. Mammalian predation accounted
   for six of the deaths and was the main cause of mortality. Only two
   deaths resulted from collisions with vehicles on the interstate. After
   the first week, fledgling kestrels began hunting along secondary roads
   and increased the use of this habitat throughout the 4 wk birds were
   observed. Mean time until the initiation of dispersal was 22.7 d after
   fledging. Only one of 17 birds recaptured in a nest box as a breeding

   large nest boxes hung up to 10.5 m above the ground. The device (nest
   box checker) consists of a periscope-like head with light source, which
   is raised to the nest box on a 10.5-m telescoping pole. Unused boxes
   could be distinguished from boxes with lichen, owls or residual nesting
   material by viewing the box interior using binoculars. Monitoring boxes
   with this device took less (xBAR = 6.4 +/- 1.04 min, range 2.7-13.5)
   time than climbing to inspect each box (xBAR = 7.5 +/- 0.98 min, range

Abstract = {{The suitability of Velcro leg tags for marking Herring (Larus
   argentatus) and Great Black-backed (L. marinus) Gull chicks was
   assessed. Tag loss was inversely related to frequency of colony-site
   visitation, as was tag-related injury, and directly related to species
   size. Differences in tag loss between species were attributed to
   differential growth rates. Velcro tags are unsuitable for Herring and
   Great Black-backed Gull productivity studies, but may be useful for
   short-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{The typically streaked brownish plumage of fledglings of many species of
   Passerine birds makes it difficult to discriminate the sexes. Here
   discriminant analysis on a set of plumage color and morphometric
   characters of an a posteriori sexed sample of Citril Finch (Serinus
   citrinella) fledglings is used to show that their plumage color is
   dimorphic, allowing for the correct sexing of 69\% of individuals
   (brown-ochreish birds tended to be males, and brown-greyish birds tended
   to be females). Use of morphometric characters allowed an additional
   28\% of birds to be correctly classified, so that most of the fledglings
   (97\%) could be sexed. It is suggested that this plumage color
   dichromatism might appear in other species, and investigators are
   encouraged to measure fledgling birds on capture and retain a sample of
   them in captivity until the completion of post-juvenal molt.}},

Abstract = {{Toxicological field studies were conducted in 1989 on 12 sites in
   north-central Washington and 12 sites in south-central Pennsylvania.
   Among the study objectives was an evaluation of the potential for
   exposure to nestling birds to an organophosphate insecticide. Artificial
   nest boxes were placed and subsequently inhabited by the European
   Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Diet, and the potential for exposure, were
   assessed by applying ligatures to the nestling birds and removing the
   food items they were being fed by the adult birds. The study allowed us
   to compare the effectiveness and ease of use of pipe cleaners and
   electrical cable-ties as ligature devices. Results indicated that given
   inexperienced personnel and minimal training, cable-ties resulted in the
   collection of twice as many crop samples with a lower rate of mortality
   than pipe cleaners. Food samples were collected 32\% of the time using
   pipe cleaners, with two mortalities in 314 ligature crop sampling
   attempts. In contrast, food samples were collected 63\% of the time
   using electrical cable-ties, with two mortalities in 594 crop sampling
   attempts.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly behavioral observations of Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) were
   conducted on five leased tracts of nonhunted private land, each

   resting, 21\% feeding, 16\% in comfort activities, 6\% in locomotion,
   4\% courting and 1\% in other behaviors. Activities differed among
   months and periods of the day. Pintails used nonhunted rice fields only
   during the day, departing after sunset. Pintail time budgets in
   Louisiana approximated those reported in California. Pintails using rice
   fields during the day, however, fed more than did those roosting on open
   water pools at Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Louisiana.
   Small (60 ha), nonhunted rice fields provided wintering Northern

Abstract = {{Six areas of Puerto Rico with high potential for occurrence of the
   Puerto Rican Nightjar (Caprimulgus noctitherus) were surveyed to
   determine present geographic distribution and abundance. Nightjar
   abundance and distribution were studied in Puerto Rico in 1985-1987,
   1989-1990, and 1992. No relict nightjar populations were found in three
   areas in the northern moist limestone forest region of the island.
   Nightjars were found in three main areas located in the coastal dry
   limestone forest and lower cordillera forest of southwestern Puerto
   Rico. Singing rates of male nightjars were higher during winter
   (January-March) than during summer (June-August) surveys. A total of 712
   singing male nightjars were recorded in 9839 ha. These were distributed
   among three separate areas: Susua-Maricao (177), Guanica (347), and
   Guayanilla (188). Densities were 0.00-0.33 nightjar/ha on Susua-Maricao,
   0.00-0.19 nightjars/ha on Guanica, and 0.04-0.13 nightjars/ha on
   Guayanilla. First site records of nightjars for the Parguera Hills and
   Sierra Bermeja, a region of coastal dry forest located in the
   southwestern end of Puerto Rico, were obtained in 1990 and 1991,
   respectively. Included in this total were 315 nightjars on 4583 ha of
   private forest land that is rapidly being cleared for urban, resort and

Abstract = {{A new fat scoring technique for small birds is introduced using 31
   classes (nine main classes with up to four subclasses each; Fig. 1). In
   contrast to many other methods, fat score and respective fat load (as
   determined by the Soxhlet method) correlate very well. Furthermore,
   variability in the calculated regression lines for nine different
   species is low. This effective new method can easily be learned by
   handling approximately 100 individual birds and substantially improves
   precision of studies on fat-deposition in migratory birds.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) on the breeding
   of Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) was studied by installing
   20 artificial burrows each, in gull-occupied and gull-free level nesting
   areas on Protection Island, Washington. The burrows were monitored from
   1989 to 1991. The presence of gulls did not affect auklet burrow use,
   breeding success or egg-laying dates. Analysis of weight/wing composite
   growth curves showed that auklet chicks from gull-free areas grew
   significantly faster than chicks from the gull colony throughout this
   study. Adult auklets, delivering fish to their young, are presumably
   more prone to kleptoparasitism by gulls when nesting in level areas,
   where they have to run across open ground to their burrows. On
   Protection Island only a small percentage of auklets nest in level areas
   occupied by gulls.}},

Abstract = {{Three light-weight, low-canopy mist-net systems were developed and
   tested in dry tropical scrub, mangrove and forest habitats. One plastic
   (polyvinyl chloride) and two aluminum pole systems (with and without
   pulleys) were used to support mist nets to heights of up to 7.3 m.
   Although the aluminum telescoping-pole system (without pulleys) was
   expensive initially (\$79-141/unit {[}US]), its use reduced capture of
   nontarget species and may have increased capture of target species when
   compared with ground-level netting. In one year, its use also reduced
   labor costs by \$756, which completely offset the higher cost of the
   aluminum telescoping-pole system when compared to the plastic-pole
   system (\$19/unit). Unlike the plastic-pole system, the aluminum
   telescoping-pole system was adjustable to any height within its range of
   1.8 to 7.3 m, was 1.5 m higher, was more efficient to operate in the
   field, and was easily moved to new locations. For capture of
   psittacines, the pulleys of the aluminum telescoping-pole system were
   not necessary, but their use may assist in efficiently retrieving large
   numbers of birds from the nets. The aluminum telescoping-pole system was
   efficient in capturing psittacines, columbids, passerines and possibly
   chiropterans in habitats with canopies < 10 m or in the forest
   subcanopy.}},

   to determine whether these characteristics differed between lakes

   could be used to predict the occurrence of loons on lakes.  The results
   indicate that, in contrast to non-occupied lakes, loons frequented lakes
   that had significantly larger surface areas and sampling site depths. 
   Also, these lakes were clearer, warmer and less productive.  The
   individual best predictors of loon use of a lake, in decreasing order of
   importance, were lake area, iron, surface temperature and sampling-site
   depth.}},

   vocalization not previously described in cowbird copulatory sequences,
   the Kek Note, was recorded in four instances. Analysis of flight
   whistles indicated that they did not differ from flight whistles given
   in other contexts. The functional aspects of producing multiple types of
   vocalizations during the copulatory attempts are discussed. For example,
   incorporation of flight whistles during copulatory attempts may reflect
   conflicting tendencies to approach and to fly off during these times of
   heightened sexual arousal. Alternatively, flight whistles may have a

   responsibility to the public for reliable information on avian
   population trends and a recognition of wide, age-related, differences in
   hearing and song detection abilities among themselves.  In this paper
   the personal audiograms of bird counters are superimposed on the
   frequency-amplitude spectrograms of bird species and the indicated
   relationship is considered as a basis for developing correction factors
   that could compensate for variable hearing abilities.  Some such
   procedure could permit the many hearing-impaired but enthusiastic older
   bird counters to continue in this personally rewarding and

Abstract = {{The site fidelity of male Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) to a molting area
   in northern Labrador was studied.  Twenty-nine male Black Ducks that
   were captured while molting were recaptured on the study area in another
   year, and three birds were recaptured in three consecutive years.  Of
   those ducks recaptured, 52\% were found on the same pond where they
   molted in a previous year.  Based upon estimated rates of natural and
   hunting mortality, about 10\% of the surviving ducks returned to the
   molting area the year after banding.  As it is likely that many
   returning banded birds were not recaptured, the true rate of return is
   probably higher.  High site fidelity may evolve if survival is enhanced
   by returning to the same molting area.}},

Abstract = {{Recommendations for building nest boxes for House Wrens (Troglodytes
   aedon) include slot rather than hole entrances and small rather than
   large cavity sizes.  To determine how these parameters influenced
   nest-building efforts by male and female House Wrens, wrens were
   provided with boxes that differed in entrance type (slot vs. hole) and
   depth (8.9 vs. 16.5 cm from entrance to nest box floor).  To collect
   data on nest mass during nest building, each nest box was fitted with an
   insert made from a half-gallon waxed-paper carton.  Inserts containing
   nests were removed from nest boxes, weighted and replaced without
   disturbing nest building.  At the completion of nesting, the inserts
   were removed and sticks in nests were weighted and counted. 
   Nest-building costs for females, which added the cup lining, did not
   differ among nest types, but costs for males, which filled the cavities
   with sticks, were dependent on box depth.  Boxes with wide, slot-shaped
   entrances were more likely to contain an active nest (i.e., at least one
   egg laid) than were hole-entrance boxes regardless of cavity depth,
   apparently because males could more readily carry sticks through slots
   than holes.}},

Abstract = {{An unfamiliar yet easily computed statistical procedure for determining
   dietary, habitat or other resource preferences of marine birds is
   described.  The technique tests for significant differences between
   individual categories of observed and expected frequency data.  The
   procedure is illustrated by examining marine habitat preferences of
   Short-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) and dietary preferences
   of Crested Auklets (Aethia cristatella) in the northwestern Bering Sea,
   Alaska.  Compared to other analytical approaches typically used during
   field investigations of marine birds, this technique has both practical
   and statistical qualities that favor its application, including:  1)
   robust and easily-met assumptions, 2) control of the experiment-wise
   error rate, 3) flexible response to unforseen logistical and sampling
   problems that frequently arise at sea, 4) greater specificity for
   determining resource preferences and 5) results based directly on counts
   of birds rather than samples of line transects or some other arbitrary
   observation interval.}},

Abstract = {{Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), Violet-green Swallows (T.
   thalassina) and Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) were observed sunbathing
   under conditions that produced apparent hyperthermia as evidenced by
   gaping, posture and timing of exposure.  Sunbathing was observed only on
   days having air temperatures above 30 C, medium to high humidities and
   low wind velocities.  Duration of sunning behavior was short, never
   exceeding 2 min.  The substrate of sunning sites under these conditions
   always exceeded 47 C.  It appeared that swallows were sunbathing in a
   fashion that led to short-term heat stress.  This implies that the
   function of this form of sunbathing in these swallows is for a purpose
   other than thermoregulation.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to trap ground dwelling owls, using monofilament nooses and
   wooden dowel rods, was developed.  Setting noose rods does not require
   modification or disturbance to the burrow and the trap can easily be
   customized to fit different physical configurations of a burrow or
   mound.  Using this technique permitted capture of 100\% of Burrowing
   Owls (Athene cunicularia) during the fledgling season, a time when owls
   were extremely wary of any change near their burrows or roosts.  Other
   capture techniques either required modification to the burrow entrance,
   had a lower capture rate, or caused adults to abandon the burrow
   temporally.}},

   failure (no feldglings produced) in order of decreasing importance were
   predation by small mammals/snakes, avian predation, predation by large

Abstract = {{Black-chinned Hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri) nests (n = 119) were
   located by means of systematic searches of two different riparian
   habitats along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona, from April
   through July 1982-1987. Most nests (94\%) were located in the introduced
   riparian shrub tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima). Active nests were present
   from 22 March through 10 July, with greater-than-or-equal-to 80\% of all
   nests active during the peak of nesting in May. Black-chinned
   Hummingbird nests were located only in tamarisk-dominated habitats,
   where nesting density ranged from 0 to 3.5 active nests/ha, and no nests
   were found in native habitats dominated by honey mesquite (Prosopis
   glandulosa). Nests were found only in riparian habitat patches that were
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.5 ha in size, exhibited
   greater-than-or-equal-to 69\% vegetative cover and had a mean canopy
   height of greater-than-or-equal-to 1.4 m. Maintenance of this
   Black-chinned Hummingbird population depends on the continued existence
   of tamarisk-dominated habitat with these minimal patch-size
   characteristics.}},

   diameter varied spatially on the 80-ha study site, and covaried with
   several microhabitat (vegetation structure) variables measured around
   nests. Total nest depth did not vary significantly, and there were no
   associations between nest morphology and several measures of catbird
   reproductive success. Variation in nest morphology was most likely
   related to concurrent variation in nesting substrates and availability
   of building materials. Nest variation could also have resulted from
   catbirds adaptively modifying their nest structure to suit local

Abstract = {{The abundance and distribution of the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius
   ludovicianus) was estimated in 32 counties located in south-central
   Illinois on, or immediately adjacent to the ``shrike extirpation
   line{''} of Graber et al. (1973). A total of 216 shrikes was observed in
   22 of the 32 counties surveyed, of which only 13 (6\%) were north of the
   extirpation line. Shrikes were most common near pastures, hedgerows,
   cornfields, and residential homes and their lawns. Regression analysis
   revealed that shrike abundance was positively correlated with the amount
   of pasture-hay meadows and covercrops, and negatively correlated with
   the amount of harvested cropland and woodland. Land-use practices appear
   to have influenced the distribution and abundance of the Loggerhead
   Shrike in Illinois.}},

Abstract = {{Many systems are used to monitor nest attentiveness and weight change of
   incubating birds, but few studies have directly compared different
   systems under the same environmental conditions. In this study, three
   systems that measure these variables for cavity-nesting waterfowl were
   designed and compared, and were tested in the laboratory and in the
   field. The plunger system is a mechanical monitor that was sensitive to
   humidity and proved ineffective in the field, but would be useful in
   controlled environment studies. The load cell system and the balance
   system are electrical systems that provide reliable, accurate
   measurement of nest attentiveness and weight change and can be set up in
   the field to operate unattended for more than a week at a time. The
   installation procedures, merits and limitations of each of these
   systems, as well as the possible lethal effect of the balance system on
   developing embryos, are described.}},

Abstract = {{Nightingale Reed-Warblers (Acrocephalus luscinia) were studied on
   Saipan, Mariana Islands from 1988 to 1991 to assess the territoriality,
   habitat use and morphology of this endangered, endemic, island species.
   Data were compared to those for closely related mainland forms to gain
   insights into differences evolved in an insular environment. Peak
   territorial activity was reached in january-February, the dry season.
   Males exhibited high site fidelity, but females had low mate fidelity
   between years. Birds inhabited mostly upland thicket-meadow vegetation,
   but they also used reed marshes, wetland thickets, and forest openings.
   Territory size in thicket-meadow complexes averaged 9338 +/- 3433 (SD)
   m2. Males were larger than females; mass, wing, tail, and tarsus length
   reliably distinguished sexes. Compared to the mainland A. orientalis and
   A. arundinaceus, A. luscinia had (1) polygyny largely or entirely
   absent, (2) much larger territories, (3) upland rather than marshes as
   the principal breeding habitat and (4) body size, particularly bill
   size, greatly increased. The shift to upland habitats may account for
   the difference in social behavior and territory size. Greater size is
   typical of island forms that may confront competitively impoverished or
   food-limited environments.}},

Abstract = {{During their first 12-17 mo of life, including their first potential
   breeding season, subadult male and female Painted Buntings (Passerina

   plumages that are virtually identical in color. As a result, sexing
   subadults by plumage color has not been possible previously. This study
   indicates, however, that birds with blue first alternate head plumage
   may be sexed as males with 90\% accuracy. In addition, males have longer
   winglengths, on average, than females. By using plumage color and
   winglength together, 73\% of males in first alternate plumage may be
   reliably sexed. In addition, about 36\% of males and 27\% of females in
   supplemental and first alternate plumage, and about 12\% of males and
   14\% of females in juvenal and first basic plumage may bc reliable sexed
   by winglength alone. A dichotomous aging and sexing key is presented.}},

   conducted at two urban, forested wetlands in Staten Island, Richmond
   County, New York, to evaluate the influence of development on bird
   species composition. Bird species composition at the Richmond Creek
   site, a habitat fragment surrounded by development, was dominated by
   non-forest, urban-resident and human-attracted species. The Latourette
   Park site, located within a wooded parcel in the Staten Island
   Greenbelt, supported significantly more forest-interior and
   human-intolerant species. The two sites did not differ significantly in
   the number of migrant or resident bird species. The study indicates that
   forest islands in New York City can provide nesting habitat for
   area-sensitive bird species, but development that encroaches upon or
   degrades these habitats promotes the urbanization of the forest bird

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of 17 yr of nest guarding from observation blinds for
   increasing reproductive success of the endangered Puerto Rican Parrot
   (Amazona vittata) is described. As personnel and time allowed, active
   nests were guarded part-time during the nest site-exploration and
   selection stage of the breeding cycle, and part-time to full-time when a
   nest contained eggs or chicks. Biologists identified nine categories of
   threat to the success of parrot nests. Since 1973, a minimum of 20
   nests, which otherwise would have failed, successfully produced
   fledglings as a direct result of nest guarding and intervention. Nest
   success averaged 66\% with nest guarding compared to an estimated 38\%
   without guarding. Nest guarding from blinds can help maintain a wild
   population of a critically endangered species while other management
   techniques are being developed to stimulate population growth.}},

Abstract = {{A key for distinguishing between adult and yearling female Merlins
   (Falco columbarius) based on the color of rump plumage was proposed by
   Temple (1972). Examination of this characteristic in 34 known-age
   females from a wild population of F. c. richardsonii, caught during
   three breeding seasons and one winter, indicated discrepancies between
   the observed rump coloration and that expected based on the predictions
   of Temple (1972). Two of the nine yearlings examined had some gray
   (associated with adult plumage) in the rump coloration, and 12 of 25
   adults were classified as having a brown rump (associated with yearling
   plumage). The onset of the change in the rump color of female Merlins
   appears much more variable, at least in this population of Merlins, than
   previously described. It would be beneficial to examine this currently
   accepted aging technique for female Merlins in more detail.}},

Abstract = {{Densities of piscivorous birds were compared among habitats on a Texas
   reservoir with warm-water effluent. The reservoir had been invaded
   recently by the exotic submergent hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata).
   Hydrilla was an important habitat for some piscivores, particularly
   Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) and also cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax spp.) and American White Pelicans (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos). Wading bird (Ardeidae) densities were low in hydrilla
   and highest in the emergent-hydrilla interface, unvegetated
   shoreline/shallow water and emergent habitats. Density comparisons
   between the main body of the lake and an associated cooling pond with
   higher water temperatures did not demonstrate consistent patterns across
   species or seasons. Overall piscivore densities were higher in the hot
   lake; this was largely due to high densities of Great Blue Herons (Ardea
   herodias) and cormorants. For many piscivores, neither the presence of
   hydrilla nor warm-water effluent influenced habitat use.}},

Abstract = {{Body mass and six linear measurements of resident (Falco sparverius
   paulus) and wintering (F. s. sparverius) American Kestrels in
   south-central Florida were compared. Sex differences in size and
   variability (coefficient of variation) were somewhat greater in
   sparverius than paulus. Means of body mass of paulus males and females
   were 21.9\% and 25.8\% less than those of corresponding sexes of
   sparverius, and means of all linear measurements except culmen length
   were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller in one or both sexes of paulus.
   Although the smaller size of kestrels in the southeastern U.S. follows
   Bergmann's rule, the size difference might be related to smaller prey
   size as well as thermoregulatory factors. Measurements of presumed
   resident kestrels from Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi suggest a
   north-south trend of decreasing size, but the data are inadequate for
   detailed geographic comparison. The general similarity of coefficients
   of variation of measurements of sparverius and paulus is interpreted as
   evidence of no, or a low level of, interbreeding in the study area even
   though paulus is greatly outnumbered by wintering sparverius and
   individuals of the two subspecies may occur in close proximity during a
   major part of the paulus breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) were captured in summer and winter in
   1987-1990 near Corvallis, Benton Co., Oregon, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Bird Banding Laboratory records (BBL) for the Willamette Valley of
   western Oregon were examined to assess seasonal population dynamics of
   these birds. Banding recoveries indicate that at least 2.2\% of these
   juncos breed on or near wintering grounds. Winter juncos of both sexes
   had significantly longer wings than summer juncos and winter males had
   significantly longer tarsi, suggesting some immigration of larger birds
   or, conversely, some emigration of smaller birds. These data indicate
   that breeding and wintering populations of Willamette Valley juncos show
   a degree of overlap characteristic of a pattern of partial migration.
   The male/female sex ratio was 2.8:1 in winter and consisted of a
   significantly greater proportion of males than in the breeding
   population. The percentage of females in winter populations of these
   juncos, from the relatively mild winter climate of western Oregon, was
   higher than predicted values for this latitude derived from eastern
   junco populations.  This is consistent with predictions of the body size
   hypothesis for skewed winter sex distributions. Thus, the variable
   effects of winter climate on survival relative to body size are probably
   an important determinant of winter distribution in Dark-eyed Juncos.}},

Abstract = {{Blowfly (Protocalliphora sialia Shannon and Dobroscky {[}Diptera:
   Calliphoridae]) parasitism of nestling Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis)
   was studied in a series of 325 nest boxes located in western New York.
   The nests were monitored closely and nestling development recorded. The
   results of this study do not support the hypothesis that blowfly
   parasitism is detrimental to bluebird nestling development and survival.
   There was no difference in mass or the length of wing, tail or tarsus
   between parasitized and unparasitized nestlings, nor was there any
   difference in the age of the young when they fledged. Survival to
   fledging did not appear to be adversely affected by parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{The density variations (at local and regional scales) of the eight most
   common bird species and of the five bird guilds present in the Biosphere
   Reserve of Nacunan during the winter, spring and summer of 1985-1988
   were studied. Both bird populations and guilds underwent important
   seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations. Local fluctuations of
   populations and guilds that were stable at a regional scale may be the
   result of the movement of individuals between sites within an
   unsaturated environment. Several bird species and guilds showed this
   pattern in Nacunan. Granivorous species reached their maximum density in
   summer, the season of minimum seed availability in Nacunan, and were
   more scarce in spring. As seeds are the most important limiting resource
   for granivores in arid zones, this evidence supports the existence of
   seed surplus in the reserve. On the other hand, granivores were
   significantly less abundant in 1988, coinciding with a dry period that
   had begun in Sep. 1987. Thus, granivores in Nacunan did not seem to
   track their resources seasonally, but they might occasionally be limited
   by unusual periods of seed shortage. The abundance of insectivorous
   guilds seems not to have been affected by the period of drought.  These
   guilds underwent important seasonal fluctuations, however, as they were
   more abundant in summer, and reached lowest densities in winter. As
   winters would be periods of arthropod shortage, migration of arthropod
   consumers may be an effective way to avoid these periods.}},

Abstract = {{The Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), a brood parasite, has
   recently undergone a wide range expansion and presently breeds
   throughout most of the United States and Canada. The small southwestern
   race, obscurus, until now has been known to breed only as far north as
   northern Arizona and northern New Mexico. From the literature and museum
   collections, it was determined that the northwestern race, artemisiae,
   has been the most abundant race in Colorado, with the eastern race,
   ater, more prevalent in the eastern portion of the state. No obscurus
   specimens from Colorado were found in museum collections. As nestlings,
   the obscurus race can be distinguished from the other two races by
   bright yellow rictal flanges. During the breeding season of 1985 in
   Boulder County, Colorado, five yellow-flanged obscurus cowbirds, which
   represented 21\% of the cowbird nestlings hatched, were observed in the
   nests of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus). In 1985 and 1986,
   twenty adult cowbirds, three (15\%) of which were identified as
   obscurus, were collected. The wing chords of adult male artemisiae
   cowbirds collected in 1985 and 1986 were significantly smaller than
   adult male artemisiae cowbirds collected in Colorado prior to 1943. The
   presence of yellow-flanged nestlings and obscurus adults indicate a
   range expansion of obscurus into Colorado, and the trend towards smaller
   artemisiae suggests gene flow of obscurus into the Colorado population.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator behavior was observed during a study (1983-1985) of the
   feeding ecology and social behavior of breeding Eurasian Wigeon (Anas
   penelope L.) in western Norway. When Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) appeared,
   wigeon and other dabbling ducks congregated in a group, became alert,
   quacked loudly and followed the predator's movement. In contrast, as
   avian predators appeared, wigeon became alert, retreated into emergent
   vegetation, or laid down on the shore with their heads stretched out,
   and remained motionless until the predator passed. Wigeon responded to
   nest predators, e.g., Common Raven (Corvus corax) and Hooded Crow (C.
   corone cornix) by assuming alert postures in 84\% and 60\% of the
   occasions in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, respectively. The
   observed difference between habitats was probably due to the birds'
   reduced ability to detect predators and escape attacks in terrestrial
   environments. Foraging wigeon responded to the presence of avian nest
   predators more by assuming alert postures during the egg-laying and
   incubation periods than during the prelaying period. Wigeon became alert
   in 78\% (terrestrial habitats) and 66\% (aquatic habitats) of the
   occasions when warning calls were given by four other species. They
   responded more to warning calls during the egg-laying and incubation
   periods than during the prelaying period. It is concluded that wigeon
   have evolved different strategies to escape attack from avian and ground
   predators. Wigeon may also benefit from warning calls given by other
   species, because warning calls may allow enhanced predator detection and
   increased foraging efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a midsummer snowstorm on nesting success of two
   populations of American Pipits (Anthus rubescens) in the Beartooth
   Mountains, Wyoming is described. An alpine population (3200 m) suffered
   79\% nestling mortality during the storm, whereas a subalpine population
   (2900 m) experienced 7\% nestling mortality. All nestlings of the alpine
   population at least 11 d old (n = 44) survived burial by snow for 24 h,
   whereas younger nestlings (n = 36) had only 11\% survivorship. This age
   effect corresponds to the age of endothermy; younger nestlings
   apparently died of exposure. Snow covered the ground for an additional
   36 h after nests were excavated; older nestlings experienced high (73\%)
   mortality, probably from starvation, during this period. The observed
   survivorship pattern was apparently unrelated to brood size.
   Implications of severe storms for alpine populations of breeding birds

Abstract = {{The Long-tailed Sabrewing (Campylopterus excellens) is a tropical
   hummingbird endemic to a small area on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
   Mexico. Almost nothing is known about this species. In the Sierra de los
   Tuxtlas, Veracruz, it appears to prefer tropical rainforest, and did not
   occur in censuses of local agricultural areas. Male song, displays and
   ritualized combat are described, and interpecific interactions with the
   congener C. hemileucurus are noted. A formula for sexing this
   monochromatic species is offered whereby (wing chord + tail) > 123.9 mm
   = male and (wing chord + tail) < 120.7 mm = female. Characters that may
   prove useful in aging individuals are noted. The breeding season is of
   unknown length, but probably begins before March.}},

Abstract = {{Within-clutch variability in shape of 1743 eggs from 301 nests of
   Emperor Geese (Chen canagicus) laid over a 5-yr period was measured.
   Individual females laid similar shaped eggs in successive years, and
   eggs among clutches within females could not be distinguished. Cluster
   analysis correctly identified 69.9\% of 136 known conspecific parasitic
   eggs. Repeatability estimates of elongation (0.73), sphericity (0.72),
   maximum width (0.69) and radius of the point (0.68) were high and
   similar to repeatability estimates of egg mass and volume of other
   species. Although width, volume and area measurements varied inversely
   with spring population size, shape variables did not. The consistency in
   shape variables despite changes in egg size suggests that shape
   variables may be used to separate and identify individuals within and
   among years despite changes in the population that may result in changes
   in egg size. Differences in egg shape among eggs within a nest are
   viable criteria for identifying parasitic eggs, especially when used in
   conjunction with other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Although said to winter entirely in southern South America, Lesser
   Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica dominica) have been recorded in
   eastern North America in small numbers throughout the winter.  A
   literature search indicates that records are regular through December,
   most of them probably of late fall migrants, and again increase in late
   February, probably of early spring migrants.  There are at least 21
   midwinter (January-mid February) records, north to North Carolina and
   exceptionally New York.  A few were crippled or injured, but others
   showed no infirmities.  ``Winter{''} specimens from the region were
   requested from North American museums; they include two adults and six
   immatures (one adult and two immatures from the mid-winter period).}},

Abstract = {{Survival rates of nine adult female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) that
   became flightless after being radio-marked in the Sacramento Valley,
   California in August 1987-1989 were estimated.  Seven of the
   radio-marked pintails molted in the Sacramento Valley, a nontraditional
   molting region, and two flew 280 km north to the Klamath Basin to molt. 
   Molting marshes were dominated by emergent vegetation in both locations.
   Two ducks, while flightless in the Sacramento Valley, were killed by
   predators.  Molting pintails remained sedentary (did not fly) for an
   average of 36 d, and the daily survival rate during this period was
   0.9934.  The resulting sedentary-period survival rate was 0.79.  Primary
   feather 9 on two captive ducks grew an average of 4.2 mm per day.  Mean
   body mass of molting ducks that died was lower than that for molting
   ducks that survived (P < 0.10).  The number of pintails molting on
   Sacramento Valley refuges is probably < 200.}},

   date of hatching.  Length of incubation and duration of hatching period
   were also documented for each species.  Although specific gravity was a
   better predictor of hatching date than egg flotation, both techniques
   were imprecise.  The regression between specific gravity and the number
   of days before hatching differed among clutches, but not among eggs
   within clutches.  Specific gravity of eggs predicted hatching date only
   to within 3.8 d for Snowy Egrets, and 4.7 d for Black-crowned

   for Great Egrets, 23.7 d for Snowy Egrets and 22.8 d for Black-crowned

Abstract = {{From 1986 to 1990 spoil islands in a 3.75-km section of the Indian River
   Lagoon were surveyed for nesting American Oystercatchers (Haematopus
   palliatus).  Of the 11 nests found, two, located during 1990, were on
   islands entirely covered by Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia)
   forest.  Successful nesting was documented for both pairs of
   oystercatchers using the forested nest sites, while only three of nine
   (33\%) of the oystercatcher nests in open beach sites on neighboring
   islands were successful.
   The use of atypical forested habitat for nesting by American
   Oystercatchers may be an adaptive response to increased human activities
   on open sandy beaches.  The relatively lower nesting success for
   oystercatchers in their traditional open sand habitat, compared to
   oystercatchers nesting on forested islands without beaches, is
   attributed to disturbance from intensive human recreation activities.}},

Abstract = {{Known occurrences of California Gnatcatchers (Polioptila californica) in
   the United States were mapped relative to the 250-m, 500-m and 750-m
   elevation contours of southern California.  Of 324 sites where this
   seriously threatened species was recorded from 1960 to 1990, 84\% were
   located below 250 m elevation, and 97\% occurred below 500 m.  A total
   of 69 historic (pre-1960) sites showed a similar elevational pattern. 
   These results indicate that previous estimates of the range of the
   northern, nominate subspecies were probably excessive, and that
   protection of coastal sage scrub habitat located above 250 m (in regions
   within 35 km of the coast) or 500 m (inland regions) may not
   significantly contribute to California Gnatcatcher conservation efforts.
   Furthermore, using the 250-m and 500-m elevation contours as approximate
   indices of the potential extent of the species' range in northwestern
   Baja California, approximately 65-70\% of the historic distribution of
   P. c. californica may have been located in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Trials to determine the impact of carrying tail-mounted devices on
   attendance patterns of Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during chick
   rearing were carried out on the Isle of May, Scotland in 1989. Patterns
   of attendance and six behavior variables were determined initially for
   51 undisturbed pairs with chicks. Packages closely resembling radio
   transmitters both in shape and weight were then attached to the central
   tail feathers of one member of each of 15 of these pairs. One member of
   five other pairs was caught and handled in the same way (except that a
   dummy was not attached) to act as controls. Three dawn-to-dusk watches
   subsequently indicated that although attendance patterns changed during
   the season, experimental, control and undisturbed birds were affected to
   a similar degree. Thus behavioral changes were probably due to a
   deterioration in feeding conditions around the colony rather than
   device-related disturbance. Kittiwakes carrying functional tail-mounted
   devices weighing < 1\% of adult body mass should, therefore, provide
   representative behavioral data even when feeding conditions are
   unfavorable.}},

Abstract = {{Crested Caracara (Polyborus plancus) was observed kleptoparasitizing
   individuals of the same and different raptor species at the Cape Region,
   Baja California Sur, Mexico during January-October 1990.  By recording
   activities using a focal animal sampling, caracaras were observed
   commonly stealing food from caracara immatures and adults, and from
   Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) at common feeding areas.  Other
   kleptoparasitized species were Harris Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) and
   Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis).  It is suggested that
   kleptoparasitism by caracaras in the Cape Region is enhanced by:  1)
   interactions at feeding areas, 2) opportunistic foraging behavior and 3)
   predictable primary and secondary food resources.  Finally, a reverse
   dominance pattern of adult-immature caracaras was observed and may have
   been related to familial relationships.}},

   Observations of predation on chicks were performed before and after
   shelters were placed next to each of 30 nests.  Predation on chicks was
   commonly observed prior to shelter placement and declined to zero
   thereafter.  The number of chicks that disappeared was significantly

Abstract = {{Winter bird feeding is generally assumed to benefit the birds using this
   food source, but there are some potential risks associated with bird
   feeding.  One is the risk that individuals using feeders may become
   overly dependent on this supplemental food supply and either fail to
   develop or lose the skills needed to forage efficiently on natural food
   when feeders are not available.  Survival rates of a resident population
   of Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus) that were regular feeder
   users, and thus potentially dependent, were compared with those of a
   resident population of chickadees that had never been exposed to a bird
   feeder, during a winter when feeders were not available to either group.
   No difference was found between the average (+/- SD) monthly survival
   rates of chickadees that had used feeders in the past (0.84 +/- 0.13)
   and those that had never used feeders (0.85 +/- 0.12).  There was no
   evidence that bird feeding promotes dependency.}},

Abstract = {{Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) normally have yellow-tipped
   rectrices, but juvenile waxwings with orange tail tips have been
   observed with increasing frequency in the eastern United States in the
   past 30 yr.  Orange-tipped rectrices contain large amounts of the red
   pigment rhodoxanthin not found in normal yellow tail tips, and berries
   containing that pigment have been hypothesized as the source of
   rhodoxanthin in these feathers.  At Powdermill Nature Reserve in western
   Pennsylvania, the first occurrence and subsequent increase in frequency
   of orange tail-banded juvenile waxwings correspond closely with the
   initial introduction and later growth and spread of two species of
   closely related honeysuckles (Lonicera morrowii and L. tatarica), one of
   which has been reported to contain rhodoxanthin.  The ripe red berries
   of these shrubs are available from June through July.  Nestling
   waxwings, which develop rectrices at this time, may be fed honeysuckle
   berries and consequently grow orange-tipped tails.  Adults do not
   normally molt rectrices until the berries are no longer available, and
   nearly always have yellow-tipped tails.  Several immature birds with
   orange tail bands were found growing yellow-tipped replacement tail
   feathers in September and October, after the honeysuckle fruiting
   period; two yellow-tipped birds were growing orange-tipped replacement
   feathers in July, when honeysuckle berries were available.  Consumption
   of rhodoxanthin-containing honeysuckle berries may also account for
   orange variants in the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and
   Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus).}},

Abstract = {{The parental investment and reproductive success of male Red-winged
   Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) that fed some of their broods were
   compared to those of males that did not feed nestlings.  Pair-fed
   nestlings experienced a higher rate of food delivery, showed a
   significantly faster rate of growth and were less likely to starve than
   nestlings fed only by females.  Thus pair-fed broods produced
   significantly more fledglings than female-fed broods.  Feeding and
   non-feeding males attracted equal numbers of mates, on average, and
   their time budgets did not differ significantly, but feeding males
   tended to be older and more experienced than non-feeding males, and
   their territories had significantly higher insect emergence than those
   of non-feeding males.  Feeding males produced on average two more young
   per year than non-feeding males.  Feeding males did not feed all of
   their broods, but generally fed the first brood that hatched on their
   territories.  These pair-fed broods were significantly larger than
   broods fed only by females paired with feeding males.  In addition,
   pair-fed broods tended to be associated with the oldest females.  Thus
   male parental investment appears to be advantageous, and males appear to
   be investing in the broods with the highest reproductive value.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of handling and blood sampling stress on

   progesterone, and estradiol in Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris
   pusilla).  Experimental birds were captured in nest traps, immediately
   bled once, then restrained for 15 or 30 min and bled again.  Effects of
   restraint and bleeding on hormone levels were variable.  Plasma
   corticosterone levels increased significantly in all experimental birds.
   In experimental birds, elevated testosterone and prolactin levels were
   decreased, while low values of testosterone increased.  Such a response
   to handling would only suppress the detection of slight differences in
   mean hormone levels between breeding stages, and would not create
   artifactual differences where none actually exist.  There was no
   relationship between sampling time and levels of prolactin,
   testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol in nonexperimental (less

Abstract = {{A breeding biology study of the Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus
   crinitus) in central Florida was conducted from 1979 to 1989 on
   individuals using wood nest boxes.  Data were collected from 46 nests;
   38 produced completed clutches.  Males arrived in late March followed by
   females 7-12 d later.  Both sexes vigorously defended the nest and
   surrounding area.  Forthy-three percent of the 46 nests were begun
   between 16-30 April.  Females built the nest, incubated the eggs for
   13-15 d, and brooded the young for about 6 d.  Clutch size ranged from
   4-6 eggs; 5 was the most common.  One brood was produced each nesting
   season; in 5 pairs renesting occurred after the first nest was
   destroyed.  Total daytime attentiveness during incubation was 68\%.  At
   least 12 clutches required more than 1 d to hatch.  Hatching and
   fledging successes for 38 completed clutches were 71\% and 72\%,
   respectively.  Hatching success was lower in April nest than in May and
   June nests, but fledging success was higher in April nests than in May
   and June nests.  Both adults fed and defended the nestlings and
   fledglings and removed fecal sacs.  Insects were the major food items
   fed to the young flycatchers.  The nestling period ranged from 13-15 d. 
   Adults and fledglings remained together as a family group in the nesting
   area for at least 3 weeks after fledging occurred.  By August,
   vocalizations of both young and adults had practically ceased and the
   birds became unobtrusive.}},

Abstract = {{Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were observed drinking and bathing in
   three high mountain bogs in the Jarbidge Mountains of northern Nevada. 
   Six additional sites in the Jarbidge and two in the Warner Mountains of
   northern California showed evidence of drinking activity.  These ``eagle
   bogs{''} all shared four physical attributes that distinguished them
   from other high mountain bogs in these ranges.  These attributes were: 
   (1) association with a spring above the highest quaking aspen (Populus
   tremuloides), (2) presence of an open area containing pools (without
   steep or undercut banks) near the spring, (3) cover on three sides in
   the form of cliffs and/or dense coniferous woodlands at least 10 m away
   from the pools, and (4) a narrow opening in the cover (10-30 m), on the
   lower side of the bog followed by a steep drop.  The frequency of Golden
   Eagle visitation strongly suggests that eagle bogs are an overlooked but
   important habitat requirement for the species in the Great Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding birds were surveyed using the spot-mapping method in 17, 16-ha
   sites representative of major successional stages in both the uplands
   and wetlands of the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, 1979-1980.  Population
   density ranged from 120 to 875 pairs/km2.  Both density and diversity
   increased with successional age in both upland and wetland series with
   peaks in the middle to late stages rather than in the oldest forests. 
   Although there were fewer species than in more northern localities, high
   diversity and low dominance characterized Okefenokee bird populations
   (Overall Shannon index 3.2, evenness index 0.89 based on importance
   values that combine numbers, frequency and biomass).  More than 50\% of
   breeding species and 75\% of individual land birds were migrants, many
   wintering in the tropics.  Since the Okefenokee is preserved and managed
   to remain more or less as it is now, our surveys provide a baseline for
   assessing future avifaunal changes that might result from changes beyond
   the Okefenokee boundaries (tropical forest destruction and climate
   change, for example).  Several hypotheses advanced to predict bird
   species diversity were tested, and we conclude that in a complex
   landscape such as the Okefenokee no one habitat feature or index will
   likely account for the avian community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Snags and nest boxes were added to 2-4-yr-old pine plantations in
   north-central Florida.  The International Bird Censusing Method was used
   to determine abundance, diversity and territory boundaries on three
   12-ha replicated, paired treatment and control plots during two
   consecutive spring breeding seasons.  Treatment and control areas were
   compared in two ways:  an analysis of variance was calculated for the
   total 12-ha plot and for a subplot consisting only of a young pine
   plantation (8 ha).  Twelve bird species were found in young pine
   plantation subplots.  Young pine plantation subplot treatments supported
   more species (P = 0.0025; df = 1) and had nearly twice as many birds as
   controls (P = 0.0066; df = 1).  There were no significant differences
   between treatment and control areas when the total plot was analyzed. 
   However, when young pine plantation treatment and control subplots were
   analyzed separately from the total plot, Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia
   sialis) and Great-crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) were found to
   use nest boxes and nested in greater numbers in treatments than in
   controls (P = 0.0105 and P = 0.0020, respectively; df = 1).
   Snags were used for perching, singing, feeding, nesting, courtship
   displays and roosting.  Presence of snags and nest boxes in 2-4-yr-old
   plantations encouraged Rufous-sided Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus),
   Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), Great-crested Flycatchers and
   Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) to include higher
   proportions of young pine plantation in their territories.  Flycatchers
   had larger territories in treatments than in controls (P = 0.0538; df =
   1).  They expanded their territories to utilize the snags and nest boxes
   in young pine plantations.  Adding snags and nest boxes artificially to
   young pine plantations seems to be an effective way to enhance young
   plantations for breeding birds.}},

   behavior and arrival times in the study area.  Thrushes and other
   ground-foraging insectivores were caught most frequently early in the
   morning, whereas aerial and foliage-gleaning insectivores were caught
   somewhat later.  The latest species included diurnal migrants such as
   Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata).  These results indicate a need to
   standardize sampling times when using banding data to estimate species
   numbers or relative abundance.}},

   significant sexual dimorphism in wing and tail length, as well as in
   some measures of bill size and wing shape.  We interpreted the sexual
   differences in wing and tail length and shape to reflect sexual
   differences in courtship displays and territorial defense.  The

Abstract = {{We recorded external measurements of adult and yearling American Crows
   (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in central Saskatchewan from late April to early
   July to develop a reliable sexing technique.  The most repeatable
   measurement was of wing length, followed by head-bill, tail and tarsus
   lengths, bill length and bill depth.  Regardless of age, males were
   larger than females and, regardless of sex, adults had longer wings and
   tails than yearlings.  The sex of 87\% of adult crows (n = 104) was
   determined using wing length alone.  Most (86\%) adult males (n = 56)
   had wing length > 311 mm, whereas 88\% of adult females (n = 48) had
   wing lengths < 308 mm.  A discriminant function analysis based on three
   measurements of size provided better sex discrimination (91.9\%) than
   wing length alone; only males were consistently misclassified as
   females.  Because of greater overlap in body size, discriminant function
   analysis with four measurements correctly classified only 79.5\% of
   yearling crows (n = 30).  Although sexual size dimorphism occurs within
   crow populations, geographical size variation may limit the extent to
   which these findings can be applied to crow populations outside
   Saskatchewan.}},

   containing three eggs and laid two eggs of their own. Two of the three
   Piping Plover eggs hatched; one chick, however, was not found. Both
   Least Tern eggs hatched; one chick was found dead, the other's fate was

Abstract = {{Interspecific differences in the foraging behavior of the three most
   abundant breeding birds in the southeastern Massachusetts pine barrens
   were more pronounced than intersexual differences. Significant and
   relevant intersexual differences did exist, however, and help to explain
   how this community is organized. The foraging behavior of female Prairie
   Warblers (Dendroica discolor) was more similar to Common Yellowthroats
   (Geothlypis trichas) than to male Prairie Warblers. Of the three
   species, male and female Rufous-sided Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus)
   showed the least amount of intersexual foraging differences. Male and
   female Common Yellowthroats foraged at different heights, but did not
   differ in the use of plant species or foraging maneuvers. The
   intersexual differences that existed are best explained by the
   hypothesis that sex-related reproductive activities constrain the
   behavior of individuals. Male Common Yellowthroats and Prairie Warblers
   often sang at heights above 3 m. The nests of these species were
   typically built in shrubs near the ground. Consequently, males of both
   species may have been foraging higher than females because of related
   male singing and female nesting activity. Male Rufous-sided Towhees may
   have been constrained morphologically to forage on the ground, because
   no intersexual differences in foraging height occurred despite the fact
   that males often sang well above the ground.}},

Abstract = {{American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are difficult to capture using
   conventional traps or nets. A technique was developed that used a
   sedative administered in baits. This technique was effective while
   causing no apparent harm to the birds. Baits were prepared by mixing the
   contents of fresh chicken eggs with the sedative alpha-chloralose.
   Fifteen crows were captured by placing treated eggs at established bait
   stations. Sedated birds were allowed to recover overnight before being
   returned to their capture sites. Long-term studies of these birds
   following their release indicate that they behaved normally. It is
   concluded that this technique can be safely used to capture crows,
   especially in winter, in open areas (e.g., agricultural fields) where
   the effects of the sedative can be fully observed.}},

Abstract = {{Biologists who study neck-banded Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) have
   used capture and resighting histories to estimate annual resighting

   Resighting errors were associated with 9.4\% (n = 155) of the birds from
   a sample of Canada Geese neckbanded in the Mississippi flyway,

   Resighting errors significantly reduced estimated resighting rates and
   significantly increased estimated numbers of marked geese in the sample.
   Estimates of survival rates were not significantly affected by

   The species, usually found in the canopy of mature rain forest, is
   considered a mistletoe (Phoradendron spp.) specialist. The Antillean
   Euphonia is here reported feeding on eight additional species of plants
   and on arthropods. After Hurricane Hugo, the species showed foraging and
   feeding flexibility such as searching and gleaning for insects from the
   underside of leaves in the mid-canopy and shrub layer of the forest, and
   eating varied food items. Behavioral changes may have resulted from
   shortage of its usual food (mistletoe) in the forest canopy as a result
   of major habitat disturbance following the passage of the hurricane.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat characteristics of interior Least Tem (Sterna antillarum) colony
   sites in the Mississippi River valley adjacent to Missouri were examined
   during 1985-1989. During 1985, Least Tern nesting colonies were located
   on sand islands and sandbars that differed from unused sand islands by
   the length of time sites were continuously exposed above the river.
   Sites used by Least Terns were more likely than unused sites to be
   continuously exposed for at least 100 d during the period 15 May-31
   August. Colony sites did not differ from unused sites in general habitat
   type (sand island, sandbar on wooded island or sand island accreted to
   the shore), nor in the amount of vegetation cover (less-than-or-equal-to
   or > 10\% vegetation cover). Within the study region, only one unused
   site that appeared to be suitable for tern nesting could be identified.
   The majority (87\%) of 2027 nests located during 1986-1989 were on fine
   (52\%) or coarse sand (35\%) substrates. Fifty-two percent of 1690 nests
   located in 1986-1989 were less-than-or-equal-to 25 cm from a stick or
   other drift material. Sand islands and sandbars in the Mississippi River
   that could be restored as tern colony sites should be elevated by the
   construction of chevron dikes to remain exposed at least 100 continuous
   days during the Least Tern breeding season.}},

   were located at four sites in eastern and central portions of the state.
   Yellow Rails occurred at sedge- and grass-dominated floodplains adjacent
   to free-flowing streams. Yellow Rails were associated with damp,
   low-lying areas (water depths in early July averaged 5-10 cm), a
   senescent mat of vegetation 15-20 cm above the substrate, and relatively
   low densities of sedge, rush, and grass stems (85-115/m2). These
   observations represent the only recent evidence that Yellow Rails might
   breed in the eastern United States; a more definitive determination of
   the status and distribution of this poorly known species in eastern
   North America is needed.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 4965 Dusky Canada Geese (Branta canadensis occidentalis) were
   neck-collared on the Copper River Delta, Alaska, in 1984-1990. Collar
   retention rates for adult geese were obtained from examination of 910
   recaptures. The effects of sex, collar age and collaring year on
   retention rates were determined using logit models. As there was a
   significant interaction between the effects of sex and collar age on
   retention rates, the sexes were modeled separately. The average annual
   retention rate for female geese (0.875 +/- 0.163 SE) was independent of
   all effects considered. Retention rates for males was influenced by
   collar age and the year collared. It is concluded that collar losses
   were substantial and that losses specific to the years modeled should be
   considered in any population model.}},

Abstract = {{Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) laid eggs in 27.2\% (37/141)

   coastal plain of Virginia in 1987 and 1988, respectively.  Only 15.2\%
   of the boxes housed warblers both years.  Stepwise discriminant function
   analyses were used to identify three significant environmental factors
   that seem to be important determinants of the attractiveness of boxes to
   warblers:  proximity to open water, average basal area of the nearest
   four trees and percent of the day during which the nest box is exposed
   to direct sunlight.  Warblers preferred sites near water surrounded by
   relatively large trees.  Preferred sites were shaded most of the day. 
   Directions of the entrance holes of nest boxes used by warblers did not
   deviate significantly from those of all boxes, nor did they deviate from
   a random direction.  Paper wasps (Vespidae) and mud-daubers (Sphecidae)
   occupied 41.8\% (1987) and 28.5\% (1988) of the boxes and appeared to
   exclude warblers.  Those boxes containing wasps and no nests were
   directed to the southeast.  During 2 yr of study, only three boxes
   contained both wasps and successful nests.  Canonical correlation
   analyses, however, indicated that wasps select boxes that generally were
   not acceptable to warblers and that warblers and wasps were in
   contention for only a few boxes in an intermediate set of conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Stein (1963) proposed an equation for the morphometric identification of
   the sibling species Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) and Alder
   Flycatcher (E. alnorum), collectively referred to as Traill's
   flycatchers.  The equation, based on bill length and wing formula, was
   reported to be very efficient, but the test was biased because the same
   specimens were used to derive the equation and to evaluate its power. 
   Applied to specimens from eastern Canada, Stein's formula correctly
   identified about 80\% of the sympatric and allopatric Alder Flycatchers
   and less than 70\% of the sympatric Willow Flycatchers.  The formula is
   thus judged not to be very reliable where it is most needed (in areas of
   sympatry).  Caution is recommended in attempts to identify Traill's
   Flycatchers on morphometric grounds before the question is
   reinvestigated using large series of specimens identified by song.}},

Abstract = {{Diets and food preferences of Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) breeding in
   southwestern Manitoba were analyzed.  Overall diets differed among
   reproductive stages, but were similar for paired males (n = 23) and
   paired females (n = 29).  Mollusks were consumed in greater quantities
   during rapid ovarian follicle growth and laying than in other
   reproductive stages.  Insects, amphipods, leeches and seeds comprised
   the majority of diets throughout the reproductive cycle.  Lesser Scaup
   preferred seeds over other foods prior to rapid follicle growth and
   during laying.  Amphipods and trichopteran larvae, the most abundant
   foods available, were the least preferred foods during these stages. 
   Mollusks also were a preferred food during egg-laying.  Availability of
   amphipods may be a key factor influencing large-scale habitat selection
   by breeding Lesser Scaup.  Wetland management practices that promote
   macro-invertebrates (especially amphipods) and seed-producing aquatic
   plants should be emphasized in conservation programs for this species.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to document the impact of introduced roof

   Antillean cays.  Ten sites on seven islands near Puerto Rico and the
   U.S. Virgin Islands were studied from 19 Feb. to 28 Mar. 1988.  Islands
   ranged from 0.83 to 5500 ha.  On each island bird surveys and rat
   trapping were employed to evaluate rat abundance and bird diversity. 
   Transects, 50-135 m in length, were used for all surveys and trapping. 
   The abundance of rats varied from 0 to 0.082 rats/h.  Increasing rat
   abundance was negatively correlated with a significant decline in bird
   diversity in xeric forest habitats, suggesting roof rats may affect bird
   diversity on Antillean Cays.}},

Title = {{AN EVALUATION OF THE METHOD OF ESTIMATING BODY-FAT IN BIRDS BY
   QUANTIFYING VISIBLE SUBCUTANEOUS FAT}},

Abstract = {{Field ornithologists frequently quantify the fat reserves of small- to
   medium-sized birds by assigning a numerical rank to visible subcutaneous
   fat.  Despite the significance and widespread application of this
   method, relatively few studies have tested its underlying assumptions. 
   Using wintering Dark-eyed Juncos, Junco hyemalis, the visible fat-class
   method was evaluated in four ways.  (1) The relationship between visible
   fat class and lipid index (angular transformation of g lipid/g lean dry
   mass) contained a significant linear term; nonlinear terms were
   nonsignificant.  At least in statistical terms, these fat-class data
   closely approach interval data.  (2) The Y-intercept of the lipid
   index-fat class relationship was significantly different from zero,
   indicating the presence of unseen lipid reserves at 0 fat class; the
   method therefore has limited utility in studies of birds involving
   severe food limitation.  (3) Wintering juncos in southwest Indiana lost
   43\% of their visible fat overnight, suggesting that fat class
   methodology can measure short-term changes in body fat of small birds. 
   (4) Important sources of error include inconsistent positioning of the
   bird during classification of visible fat, mistaking nonfat tissue
   (e.g., gut) for fat, difficulties with classification of fat in dead
   specimens, and observer bias.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of different probability cutpoints and associated
   variations in sample size on population sex ratios were inferred with
   birds sexed by discriminant function analysis (DFA).  Using two data
   sets from Dunlins (Calidris alpina) collected in western Washington
   state as examples, it was observed that selection of high probability
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 0.95) cutpoints resulted in biased population
   sex ratio estimates.  Overall, approximately 80\% of the samples from
   the two data sets (in the probability cutpoint range of
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.7) used in the analyses were required for
   accurate estimation of sex ratios.  Calculation of sample sizes required
   for a 5\% error bound on the estimate of the proportion of females in
   the study population indicated that 200-300 samples were required.  This
   figure will probably vary for other species of birds with different sex
   ratios and population sizes.  A technique from the statistical
   literature for assessing the statistical limitations of sex ratios based
   on data sets with fixed sample sizes is presented.  DFA has great
   potential as a passive, physically nondestructive technique for sexing
   species of monochromatic birds, but sample size must be considered when
   population parameters such as sex ratio are inferred using birds sexed
   by DFA.}},
