Abstract = {{We designed a system of solar-powered video cameras that transmitted
   images via telemetry to a monitor. This system allowed us to study the
   breeding behavior of the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) in the
   Pyrenees (northeastern Spain). From 2000 to 2004, 12 nests in seven
   territories were equipped with video cameras. To avoid disturbing the
   birds, equipment was installed 3-8 weeks before egg-laying. The
   acceptance rate was 75\%. No decline in productivity was observed for
   nests monitored with video cameras compared to control nests. The
   cameras enabled us to document egg-laying, hatching asynchrony, the
   nestlings' diet, and the parents' breeding behavior from distances of
   2-3 km, although technical problems temporarily interrupted the
   transmission of images. Video cameras can be used successfully to study
   the Bearded Vultures, and probably other cliff-nesting rapiers, without
   reducing productivity.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the diet of White-throated Hawks (Buteo albigula) during the
   incubation and nestling periods in the southern temperate forest of
   Argentina. Pellets (N = 74) and prey remains (N = 59) were collected at
   10 nests from 1998 to 2003, and preys delivered to two nests were
   monitored during the 2001-2002 breeding seasons. White-throated Hawks
   fed on small mammals, birds, lizards, and insects. The three methods of
   identifying prey (pellets, prey remains, and direct observation)
   produced different results. All types of prey except large birds were
   detected in pellets, and arthropods may have been over-represented in
   pellets due to secondary consumption. No remains of either arthropods or
   reptiles were identified among prey remains collected at nest sites and,
   during nest observations, we were unable to identify many of the prey
   items delivered by adults. Our results indicate that accurate
   determination of the diet of White-throated Hawks requires more than one
   method of identifying prey.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology of Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius
   ludavicianus) in northeastern Oregon from 1995 to 1997 and 2000 to 2001.
   A wildfire in 1998 burned approximately half the big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata) at this site, permitting comparison Of Population
   parameters before and after this event. Shrike density after the fire
   was half that before the fire, a reduction likely due to loss of
   suitable nesting habitat. Mayfield estimates of nest survivorship were
   39\% (range: 30-46\%) in the years before and 19\% (range: 12-26\%)
   after the fire, among the lowest ever recorded for this species. In
   2000, young fledged from only 21\% of the territories. Due to persistent
   renesting, young Hedged from 67\% of the territories in 2001, a
   percentage similar to that before the fire. After the fire, shrikes
   nested more frequently in Substrates other than big sagebrush,
   especially juniper trees (Juniperus occidentalis). Clutch size,
   fledglings per Successful nest, and fledgling Survival were similar in
   both periods of the study Poor nesting Success across all years Suggests
   that productivity may play a role in regional declines of shrike
   populations, and that the loss and fragmentation of nesting habitat due
   to fire may further reduce productivity. Given the threats facing
   remaining sagebrush habitat, as well as Loggerhead Shrike population
   declines, we recommend aggressive fire control measures and further
   protection for remaining tall sagebrush communities.}},

Abstract = {{Carotenoid pigments produce the red, orange, and yellow plumage of many
   birds. Carotenoid-containing feathers are typically rich in color and
   displayed by all adult members of the species. In many gulls and terns,
   however, an unusual light pink coloring (or flush) to the normally white
   plumage can be found in highly, variable proportions within and across
   populations. The carotenoid basis of plumage flush was determined in all
   Elegant Tern (Sterna elegans; Hudon and Brush 1990), but it is not clear
   if all larids use this same mechanism for pink plumage coloration. We
   examined the carotenoid content of pink feathers in Franklin's (Larus
   pipixcan) and Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) gulls and found that a
   single carotenoid-astaxanthin-was present. Astaxanthin was primarily
   responsible for the flush in Elegant Terns as well, but was accompanied
   by other carotenoids (e.g., canthaxanthin and zeaxanthin), as is typical
   of most astaxanthin-containing bird feathers. In both gull and tern
   species, carotenoids were contained within feathers and did nor occur on
   the Plumage surface in preen oil, as some have previously speculated. We
   hypothesize that some gulls turn pink because they acquire unusually
   high amounts of astaxanthin in their diets at the time of feather
   growth. It is tempting to link the increase in sightings of pink
   Ring-billed Gulls since the late 1990s with the introduction Of pure,
   synthetic astaxanthin to the diets of hatchery-raised salmon.}},

Abstract = {{Some birds exhibit clustered breeding in which all-purpose territories
   are densely packed, leaving intervening but apparently suitable habitat
   unoccupied. Clustering could be ecologically driven by material resource
   patterns or socially driven by social or sexual benefits. Least
   Flycatchers (Empidonax minimus) breed in clusters in forests over much
   of North America. In 2003, we mapped all Least Flycatcher clusters along
   18.7 km of secondary roads in central Ontario. In May 2004, we broadcast
   recorded territorial song in five areas not used by Least Flycatchers in
   2003, but in the same study area. During settlement, we found Least
   Flycatchers in the established clusters, in three of five treatment
   sites, and in one nontreatment site. However, no pairs were noted at the
   treatment sites, and no males ultimately remained. One male did,
   however, defend a territory at a treatment site for 6 d. Despite limited
   success at attracting Least Flycatchers to new locations, manipulating
   settlement using social cues could be a useful management tool for some
   species.}},

Title = {{Comparison of survey methods for wintering grassland birds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-60}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Although investigators have evaluated the efficacy of survey methods for
   assessing densities of breeding birds, few comparisons have been made of
   survey methods for wintering birds, especially in grasslands. In winter,
   social behavior and spatial distributions often differ from those in the
   breeding season. We evaluated the degree of correspondence between
   density estimates based on different survey methods. Surveys were
   conducted during two winters (2001-2002 and 2002-2003) on 16 grassland
   sites in southwestern Oklahoma. Line-transect (using a detection
   function to account for birds present but not detected) and area-search
   (where density was based on the total count within a given area) methods
   were employed. Observations on line transects were also analyzed as
   strip transects, where density was based on total count within a given
   strip width and no detection function was used. Savannah Sparrows
   (Passerculus sandwichensis), LeConte's Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii),
   Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus),
   Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C. ornatus), and Eastern Meadowlarks
   (Sturnella magna) were sufficiently abundant to allow comparison.
   Area-search density estimates tended to be higher than line-transect
   estimates for Savannah Sparrows, Song Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks,
   suggesting that some individuals initially located close to the transect
   line were not detected on line transects. The area-search and
   line-transect methods gave similar density estimates for
   Chestnut-collared and Smith's longspurs. Area-search estimates of
   Eastern Meadowlarks were significantly higher in the second year of the
   study only. For this species, area-search estimates did not differ from
   those of strip transects covering an equal area, so the reason for the
   differing meadowlark estimates is not clear. Higher density estimates
   using the area-search method likely resulted from: (1) birds that might
   escape detection by hiding were more likely detected (flushed) during
   area searches A because of the repeated passes through the area, and (2)
   birds close to the line in line transects escape detection by A hiding,
   biasing those estimates low. We also evaluated the correspondence of
   density rankings for the six species as determined by the different
   survey methods and for the same species across survey sites.
   Correlations among the six species of the area-search results with those
   of line transects and strip transects generally were high, increasing in
   2002-2003 when densities of birds were greater. All three methods
   provided similar density rankings among species. Density rankings within
   species across sites for the four non-longspur species generally were
   concordant for the three site differences, especially when densities
   vary methods, suggesting that any of them wilt adequately reflect among
   greatly across sites. Further research is needed to determine the extent
   to which grassland birds are missed on line A transects. We suggest that
   workers using line transects to study these species give careful
   consideration and make additional efforts to satisfy the
   distance-sampling assumption that all birds on or near the line are
   detected. If density is measured as a total count in a fixed area, we
   recommend that observers pass within < 10 m of all points in the area.}},

Abstract = {{In territorial species, increased density is often linked to all
   increase in aggressive interactions, which may, result in trade-offs
   between competitive behavior and nest construction We examined the
   impact of nestin ` g in areas of high-density versus low-density nest
   boxes on conspecific interactions and nest-building effort in a
   population of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We also examined
   whether expected differences in behavior related to variation in nest
   quality and reproductive success in high-density and low-density areas.
   No differences in either nest-building behavior or reproductive success
   were observed between areas of high-density and low-density boxes, but
   there was a tendency of more frequent behavioral interactions at high
   density. Similarly, there was a significant difference between pairs
   defending single nest boxes and those defending Multiple nest boxes in
   the number of interactions with conspecifics. These results Suggest that
   although there may be more competition with conspecifics for Tree
   Swallows nesting at high density, this does not appear to affect either
   nest quality of reproductive Success.}},

Abstract = {{Development of minimally invasive techniques to collect blood in
   free-living birds is desirable for both ethical and conservation
   reasons. We describe a new, simple technique for collecting blood
   samples from waterfowl eggs that involves recovering blood from a small
   hemorrhage after puncturing the shell of eggs showing the first signs of
   hatching. This technique allowed us to obtain a large number of blood
   samples from hatchling Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica)
   and did not require the sacrifice or retention of any individuals, thus
   minimizing stress. High-quality blood samples for genetic Studies were
   obtained, with no adverse effects on either embryos or the post-hatch
   survival of young geese.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the sex of Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) cannot be
   determined by in-hand methods. Males and females do not differ in
   plumage and overlap in size. We collected feather samples and
   morphological measurements from migrating birds at Four sites in the
   western United States. Sex was determined for individual birds using
   sex-specific DNA markers and polymerase chain reaction was used to
   identify these DNA markers. Using discriminant function analysis, we
   created equations for determining the sex of Red-tailed Hawks using
   in-hand measurements based on the DNA-determined sexes. We formed two
   equations, one for adults that was 98\% accurate, and one for hatch-year
   birds that was 97\% accurate. The ability to determine the sex of
   western Red-tailed Hawks using morphological measurements will be useful
   to investigators examining possible intra- or intersexual differences.}},

Abstract = {{Swallows and martins are infrequent hosts of the generalist brood

   attempts by White-rumped Swallows (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) over a

   (three nests, or 6\%). Of the three nests parasitized, cowbirds (N = 1
   per nest) successfully fledged from two. Eight of 13 swallow eggs in
   these three nests were punctured by cowbirds, and all but one swallow
   nesting starved at the two parasitized nests. At least two factors may
   contribute to the low frequency of parasitism of White-rumped Swallows
   by Shiny Cowbirds, including the inability of the larger cowbirds to
   enter some nest cavities and the aggressive nest defense behavior of

Abstract = {{We present the first report of population density and home range
   estimates for the Chestnut Wood-quail (Odontophorus hyperythrus), an
   endemic and nearly threatened species of the Colombian Andes. Density
   estimates were obtained using playbacks and spot mapping and point
   transect methods. Home range sizes were estimated by radio tracking five
   wood-quail. Estimated densities varied from 0.3 to 0.4 groups per
   hectare. These densities are similar to those reported for other
   mountain wood-quail, but higher than those for lowland wood-quail and
   other species in the family Odontophoridae. Estimates of home range size
   varied from 2.6 to 9.0 hectares per group, and seemed to be correlated
   with group size. We also found evidence of overlap in the home ranges of
   neighboring groups. population densities may vary with factors Such as
   habitat type, but our estimates allow a first approximation of the
   population sizes of Chestnut Wood-quail in forest fragments.}},

Abstract = {{The Mouth of the Yangtze River is an important stopover site for
   migratory shorebirds using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. From 1984
   to 2004, we censused and banded shorebirds and monitored hunting
   activities at the mouth of the Yangtze River to understand how
   shorebirds used the study area. Counts and banding data revealed greater
   numbers of shorebirds at the mouth of the Yangtze River during northward
   migration (spring) than during southward migration (fall), with ratios
   varying from 1.5:1 to 7.2:1 at different sites from 1984 to 2005. The
   most common species observed during spring (northward) migration were
   Great Knots (Calidris tenuirostris), Red Knots (Calidris canutus),
   Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica), Sharp-tailed Sandpipers (Calidris
   acuminata), and Red-necked Stints (Calidris ruficollis). During spring
   2003-2004, 96.98\% of the shorebirds observed were adults (ASY or older)
   and 3\% were after hatching-year and second-year birds (AHY or SY). In
   contrast, almost all (94.73\%) birds counted during the fall were
   hatching-year (HY) birds. These results indicate that adult shorebirds
   either use a different migration route during fall to migration or use
   the same route, but do not stop at the mouth of the Yangtze River. HY
   birds, however, may depend on the coastal stopover sites for feeding
   during their first southward passage.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate determination of nest fates and nest predators is possible
   through continuous video monitoring, but such monitoring is relatively
   expensive and labor intensive. If documenting of the timing of nest
   termination events is Sufficient, then data loggers (DL) may allow more
   extensive sampling a. may represent a viable alternative. I validated
   temperature DL records of nest survival time by simultaneous videotaping
   and compared results derived from DL records with those obtained by
   regular nest visits by an observer. I estimated the fate of 937 nests of
   nine species of open cup-nesting songbirds, including 673 nests
   monitored using DL, 165 monitored using video cameras, 33 validation
   nests monitored simultaneously using both DL and video cameras, and 132
   control nests monitored only by observer visits. Deployment of DL did
   not negatively influence nest survival rate. DL reliably recorded
   survival time and allowed classification of nest fates based on the
   potential fledging age, regardless,of the frequency of nest visits by an
   observer. The true fate of nests that survived beyond the potential
   fledging age can not be safely determined from time of failure, except
   for nocturnal events that suggest partial predation. Video revealed
   frequent partial or complete predation on nests with old nestlings that
   would have been categorized as successful by other methods. I conclude
   that temperature DL are efficient, reliable, and relatively inexpensive
   tools for recording exact nest survival times and classification of nest
   fates, with implications for nest survival modeling and discriminating
   between diurnal and nocturnal predation.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial songbirds generally use song to defend territories and
   attract mates, but conspecific song may also serve as a cue to attract
   other male songbirds to a breeding site. Although known to occur in some
   colonial and forest-associated species, only recently have investigators
   examined conspecific attraction in grassland species. We used a playback
   experiment to examine the possible role of conspecific attraction for
   mates searching for potentially suitable breeding habitat in a grassland
   specialist, the Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii). Experimental
   playback plots and control plots with similar landscape and vegetation
   characteristics were established at two sites in North Dakota. Baird's
   Sparrows colonized three of six experimental plots and none of six
   control plots. Males on experimental plots established territories
   adjacent to the playback stations and were sometimes observed
   counter-singing with the playback of conspecific songs. Vegetation
   characteristics were similar on all study plots, and did not explain
   differences in bird density on our treatment plots. Although we found
   that playback of conspecific songs attracted male Baird's Sparrows to
   previously unoccupied, potentially suitable habitat, further.
   experiments are needed to examine the importance of conspecific
   attraction relative to other cues that birds may use, such as vegetation
   features. The conservation and management implications of conspecific
   attraction are not completely understood, but the presence of
   conspecifics should be considered as a potential cue in habitat
   selection by all species of birds.}},

Abstract = {{Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains (SGP), USA, use
   freshwater playas and saline lakes as stopovers. The importance of
   playas is well documented, but the role of saline lakes is not clearly
   understood. During 2002 and 2003, we conducted surveys to determine the
   extent to which the saline lakes serve as stopovers. Twenty-eight
   species were recorded, and total seasonal abundance ranged from 6779 to
   29,924 birds. Potential shorebird abundance for extant saline lakes was
   estimated at 37,000-71,000 shorebirds annually. American Avocets
   (Recurvirostra americana), Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Baird's
   Sandpipers (C bairdi), Least Sandpipers (C minutilla), Snowy Plovers
   (Charadrius alexandrinus), Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and Wilson's
   Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) were the most abundant species.
   Community composition of shorebirds differed between saline lakes and
   regional freshwater playas. Peak spring abundance was generally in
   April, whereas summer/fall migration was more protracted and shorebird
   abundance peaked during 6-8 weeks in August and September. Migration
   chronologies differed among morphologically similar species, and among
   representative species from different guilds. Such patterns of temporal
   separation permit partitioning of resources by shorebirds migrating
   through the SGP. The saline lakes of the SGP should be regarded as
   stopover sites of regional and international value. To ensure that
   saline lakes function as stopovers and to help maintain those unique
   communities that inhabit them, conservation of saline takes should focus
   on preserving spring flows and conserving water.}},

Abstract = {{Adult Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) reportedly respond to nocturnal
   predation by deserting colonies from the time of disturbance until dawn
   the following morning. However, direct evidence for this behavioral
   response is limited because the nocturnal behavior of individual terns
   is difficult to monitor due to low visibility and the vulnerability of
   terns to disturbance at night. We monitored the nocturnal incubation
   behavior of 10 pairs of nesting Common Terns using continuously
   recording temperature sensors disguised in dummy eggs and placed in the
   nests. Changes in egg temperature during the night suggested that a
   range of desertion behaviors occurred in response to visits by a Great
   Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) that preyed on chicks and adult terns. As
   many as three desertion events (desertion at one or more nests in a
   single 12-min period) were detected on a single night and nests were
   unattended for an average of 54 min (range 8-352 min) per desertion
   event. Nest temperature sensors allowed us to detect individual
   responses to nocturnal predators and to determine that desertion
   behavior was more varied than previously assumed. Desertion events were
   most frequent when physical evidence indicated the presence of an owl in
   the colony and during nights after owl predation, suggesting that
   desertion is a response to the actual risk of predation as well as to
   the possibility of predation.}},

Abstract = {{Carotenoid-based coloration of skin and plumage has been found to be
   correlated with individual quality in many species of birds during the
   breeding season. However, less is known about the possible role of these
   signals during the nonbreeding season, particularly among nonpasserines
   that defend winter territories. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) are
   sexually dimorphic raptors that defend winter territories and possess
   carotenoid-based morphological features known to be correlated with
   individual quality. Much is known about winter territory use and habitat
   segregation by male and female kestrels, but possible relationships
   among morphological features, individual quality and habitat quality
   have not been examined. Our objective was to examine possible
   relationships between morphology, territory quality, and skin color of
   American Kestrels. Male kestrels had brighter skin than females, and the
   skin color of male kestrels was positively correlated with size (wing
   chord and tail length) and territorial quality (hunting territories with
   less canopy and more grass cover). No such relationships were found for
   female kestrels. Skin color appears to be an honest indicator of quality
   for male American Kestrels and may serve both intersexual (territory
   acquisition) and intersexual (mate choice) functions during the breeding
   and nonbreeding seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Many temperate-zone birds must track seasonal variation in food
   availability to time breeding and enhance reproductive success. However,
   the external cues birds use to fine-tune sexual development and timing
   of reproduction remain unclear. One possibility is that birds may use
   chemical substances it, plants and bud tissues as a reliable predictor
   of leaf flush and the appearance of caterpillars, the preferred prey of
   many insectivorous birds during the breeding season. However, few data
   on seasonal shifts in key plant material consumption are available. To
   test this hypothesis, we examined the gizzard contents of Corsican Blue
   Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), a small passerine bird with a breeding
   schedule tightly linked to the phenology of oak trees. We quantified and
   compared the consumption of tree buds by birds captured during winter
   (nonbreeding) and early spring (prebreeding), and found that bud use by
   Blue Tits was limited and constant through time. Fewer than 30\% of
   birds had buds in their gizzards during the critical prebreeding period,
   and these items represented less than 1\% of gizzard contents. It is
   unlikely that this limited use of buds allowed birds to track a
   potential chemical signal at the time of reproductive decision making.
   Unless more data on the consumption of plant material become available,
   we suggest that other environmental factors be examined to help identify
   the cues used by temperate-zone birds to time their reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Food is generally considered to be the primary resource structuring
   winter territories in migrant songbirds, but there is little
   experimental evidence to support this. In southeastern Louisiana, ripe
   fruits, consumed opportunistically in the absence of preferred arthropod
   resources, are a primary food resource for wintering Hermit Thrushes
   (Catharus guttatus). To test the possible role of food in controlling
   space use during the winter, we reduced fruit availability in the
   territories of wintering Hermit Thrushes and compared responses of these
   thrushes to those in control territories where fruit availability was
   not altered. We found that thrushes did not adjust either territory size
   or location in response to midwinter reduction of fruit availability.
   One possible explanation for this lack of response is that sufficient
   food, including arthropods, was available in thrush territories even
   after removal of fruit. Another possibility is that the removal of fruit
   did reduce food levels below the level needed to meet energetic needs,
   but social constraints on territory structure, dictated by fall
   settlement spacing and maintained by agonistic interactions, prevented
   birds from adjusting territories to match food supply later in the
   season.}},

Abstract = {{The threatened Atlantic Coast population Of Piping Plovers (Charadrius
   melodus) has not increased in recent years and remains 332 pairs short
   of the recovery goal of 2000 pairs. Habitat loss to development is a
   major threat to the population, and there has been interest in restoring
   nesting and foraging habitat. However, the demographic response of
   coastal Piping Plovers to either habitat loss or creation has not been
   documented. We estimated survival rates and site fidelity of a declining
   Piping Plover population on Long Island, New York, from 2001 to 2005 on
   a beach subject to human development and recreation. The mean annual
   adult survival was 0.703 +/- 0.032 (SE) and was similar among years.
   Site fidelity during the period of territory establishment averaged
   0.827 +/- 0.069 (SE). Given this high site fidelity, ensuring the
   survival of adults is important for maintaining local populations.
   Although the 2002-2004 average was high, site fidelity was apparently
   lower in 2003 than in 2002. This decrease in site fidelity may have been
   related to several years of habitat loss and increasing predation of
   nests or chicks, as reported in a partly concurrent long-term study at
   our site. The species-level effect of local dispersal due to
   anthropogenic habitat loss depends on the fitness of dispersers, and is
   currently unknown for Piping Plovers.}},

Abstract = {{In studies of avian nest success, investigators often face the difficult
   task of periodically checking nest status while at the same time
   limiting observer influence on nest survival. Remotely monitoring nests
   using temperature data loggers is one method that allows for continuous
   data capture regarding nest status (i.e., active vs. inactive) without
   the negative effects associated with repeated nest checks. We used small
   temperature data loggers (Thermochron iButtons) to remotely monitor
   nests of Long-billed Curlews (Numenius americanus) in northeastern
   Nevada. Data loggers programmed to record temperature at 10-min and
   20-min intervals were placed in curlew nests. Data loggers were set to
   collect data throughout the nesting cycle to determine onset of
   incubation and timing of nest failure. On average, Long-billed Curlews
   began incubating approximately 3 d after the first egg was laid and
   onset of incubation coincided with the laying of the third egg. iButtons
   allowed us to determine when incubation was terminated in 17 of 23
   unsuccessful Long-billed Curlew nests, including 13 of 17 depredated
   nests. The presence of iButtons in Long-billed Curlew nests did not
   affect daily survival rate, egg hatchability or rate of nest
   abandonment. iButtons are an efficient and practical means for remotely
   monitoring nests of large egg-laying birds, such as the Long-billed
   Curlew.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation can create negative edge effects that reduce the
   reproductive success of birds nesting near the forest/nonforest
   interface, and threaten bird populations deeper in remnant forest
   habitats. Negative edge effects may be more pronounced in landscapes
   that are moderately fragmented, particularly where agriculture is the
   primary land-use fragmenting forests. Information about the extent and
   strength of edge effects at a site can help guide conservation actions,
   and determine their effectiveness. We examined edge effects for birds
   breeding in a nearly contiguous forest fragmented by relatively narrow
   agricultural corridors in Illinois (USA). We measured rates of nest
   predation and brood parasitism for Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax
   virescens) over a continuum of distances from the edge of an
   agricultural inholding. Nest predation and brood parasitism were highest
   near the edge and decreased with increasing distance from the edge.
   Given the cumulative effects of nest predation and brood parasitism on
   reproductive success, we determined that forest within 600 in of the
   inholding was sink habitat. We found, however, that deeper forest
   interior areas currently serve as source habitat, and that conversion of
   the entire 205 ha agricultural corridor to forest would add 1350 ha of
   source habitat for Acadian Flycatchers. Such results provide support for
   a local conservation strategy of forest consolidation and establish
   baseline measures necessary to determine the relative effectiveness of
   any subsequent reforestation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Although sexual differences in birds can be extreme, differences between
   males and females in body size and plumage color are more subtle in many
   species. We used a genetic-based approach to determine the sex of male
   and female Steere's Liocichla (Liocichla steerii) and examine the degree
   of size dimorphism and plumage dichromatism in this apparently
   monomorphic species. We found that males were significantly larger than
   females. In addition, Steere's Liocichla have a prominent yellow plumage
   patch on the lores that was significantly larger in males than females
   for both live birds and museum specimens. We also used reflectance
   spectrometry to quantify the color of the yellow-green breast feathers
   of Steere's Liocichla and found no significant differences between males
   and females in brightness, intensity, saturation, or hue. However,
   females tended to have brighter breast plumage, particularly at long
   wavelengths. Collectively, these color variables were useful in
   discriminating birds according to sex when used in a discriminant
   function analysis. Our study suggests that sexual selection may be more
   widespread than once assumed, even among birds considered monomorphic,
   and emphasizes the need for additional data from tropical and
   subtropical species.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that the abundance of Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) and their hosts, as well as parasitism rates, changed
   between 1992-1993 and 2001-2003 in riparian habitats in the Okanagan
   Valley, British Columbia, Canada, where riparian habitat has been
   reduced in area by more than 85\% over the past 60 years. Cowbird
   abundance declined from a mean of 2.1 and 1.9 individuals per census
   plot in 1992 and 1993, respectively, to 0;66 individuals per plot in
   2001-2002. The mean number of potential host individuals per census plot
   was also lower in 2001-2002 (5.5) than in 1992 (7.0) and 1993 (7.8).
   Although the percentage of Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) nests
   parasitized declined (77\% in 1992-1993 to 50\% in 2002-2003), Yellow
   Warblers and Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in the Okanagan Valley
   continue to be parasitized at high rates and have low nesting success.
   Host species and the distance of nests from the edge of nest patches
   were the strongest predictors of both nest success and parasitism,
   indicating the importance of large continuous patches of shrubs that
   allow nests to be located further from edges.}},

Abstract = {{Nest predation is the primary cause of nest failure in most passerine
   birds, and increases in nest predation associated with anthropogenic
   habitat disturbance are invoked as explanations for population declines
   of some bird species. In most cases, however, the identity of the nest
   predators is not known with certainty. We monitored active bird nests
   with infrared time-lapse video cameras to determine which nest predators
   were responsible for depreciating bird nests in northern New Hampshire.
   We monitored 64 nests of I I bird species during three breeding seasons,
   and identified seven species of predators during 14 predation events. In
   addition, we recorded two instances of birds defending nests from
   predators and, in both cases, these nests were ultimately lost to
   predation. These results contrast with other studies in terms of the
   relatively high proportion of nests depreciated by raptors and mice, as
   well as the absence of any predation by snakes. The diverse suite of
   predators in this and other studies is likely to confound our
   understanding of patterns of nest predation relative to fragmentation
   and habitat structure.}},

Abstract = {{On 28 October 1996, 1 found a Mottled Piculet (Picumnus nebulosus) nest
   on Anhangava Mountain in southern Brazil. The nest cavity (10.6 cm X 5.6
   cm) was in the trunk of a dead tree at a height of 85 cm. The
   circumference of the trunk at cavity height was 37 cm and the cavity
   entrance (diameter = 2.46 cm) was located near the top of the chamber.
   The nest was lined with wood fragments and contained four eggs. On
   average, eggs were 16.3-mm long and 13.0-mm wide and weighed 1.38 g. The
   parents spent 17 d incubating the eggs. Hatchlings had closed eyes and
   no feathers. By 20 d posthatching, nestlings were active and had plumage
   similar to that of adult females. Young fledging 22-25 d alter hatching
   Nestling weight gain and tarsus growth were fastest at the beginning of
   the nestling period, while wing, tail, and culmen growth had a linear
   relationship with nestling age. Both the adult male and female provided
   parental care during the nestling period. Although, the nesting behavior
   of Mottled Piculets was similar to that reported for other members of
   the genus, information on the reproductive biology of species in the
   genus Picumnus is still limited.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting biology of the Eastern Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla
   tschutschensis) was studied at Cape Romanzof, Alaska, an arctic tundra
   site on the Bering Sea coast near the northeastern limit of the breeding
   distribution of the Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla
   flavalcitreolaltschutschensis) species complex. Ninety-four nests were
   located and monitored from 1996 to 1999. Females built nests in 5-7 d,
   and nests were located on the ground. The mean clutch size was 5.6 eggs,
   and the mean incubation period was 11 d. Both adults incubated, and some
   males had a partial brood patch. The mean duration of the nestling
   period was 11.6 d, and both parents brooded and fed the young. Some
   adults began the complete prebasic molt (including primaries) while
   their young were still in the nest. Nestling development was similar to
   that reported for other Yellow Wagtails (sensu lato), but the breeding
   cycle and breeding season of Eastern Yellow Wagtails was compressed
   relative to Western Yellow Wagtails in Europe and to other passerine
   species breeding in western Alaska. Some breeding events overlapped,
   including initiation of egg laying before completion of nest building
   and initiation of adult molt while young were still in the nest. Clutch
   sizes were larger than reported for most European relatives. Clutch size
   generally fit with models predicting an increase of about one egg per 19
   degrees of increased latitude. Rapid nest initiation, overlap of
   breeding cycle events, nest attendance (including incubation) by males,
   and slightly larger clutches appear to be adaptations to high-latitude
   breeding in this long-distance migrant.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) may be due to sexual and natural selection,
   but identifying specific mechanisms that generate such dimorphism in a
   species is difficult. I examined SSD in Carolina Wrens (Thryothorus
   ludovicianus) by examining (1) the degree of SSD in the population and
   between pairs using five morphometrics, (2) assortative mating patterns
   based on size and age, and (3) relationships between size and longevity.
   Analysis revealed that males were significantly larger than females in
   all body measurements. For example, mass, bill, and wing measurements
   yielded a canonical variable that permitted separation of the sexes and
   linear classification functions correctly determined the sex of 95\%
   (238/250) of all wrens measured. No evidence was found to suggest that
   SSD was related to resource partitioning. However, assortative mating
   trends based on morphometrics (e.g., wing length), positive associations
   between longevity and morphometrics (e.g., wing length in females and
   body size in males), and intense male-male contests for territorial
   resources year-round provide evidence that sexual selection may
   contribute to SSD in Carolina Wrens.}},

Abstract = {{Birds in Neotropical forests frequently follow army ants to forage for
   insects. Here we report the first record of several species of
   Neotropical grassland birds following army ants (Labidus praedator) and
   yellow armadillos (Euphractus sexcinctus). We observed Strange-tailed
   Tyrants (Alectrurus risora) following army ants in El Bagual Ecological
   Reserve in Argentina. Other species also observed following army ants
   included Pampas Finches (Embernagra platensis), Wedge-tailed
   Grass-finches (Emberizoides herbicola), Long-tailed Reed-finches
   (Donacospiza albifrons), Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), Rufous
   Horneros (Furnarius rufus), Gray Monjitas (Xolmis cinerea), and
   Pale-breasted Spinetails (Synallaxis albescens). Strange-tailed Tyrants
   and Wedge-tailed Grass-finches were also observed following armadillos.
   Because birds were observed capturing insects flushed by the army ants
   and armadillos, our observations indicate that birds that
   opportunistically follow army ants and armadillos benefit from the
   association.}},

Abstract = {{Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) impose costs on their hosts,
   usually resulting in fewer or no host young being raised. In 95\% of the
   studies where attempts were made to estimate the cost of parasitism,
   cost was measured as the difference in host nestling survival in
   parasitized and unparasitized nests. For hosts that fledge at least some
   of their own young along with cowbirds, the magnitude of further brood
   reduction beyond the nestling stage is not known. To examine the
   possibility that further brood reduction occurs during the fledgling
   stage, we compiled 102 observations of 45 species feeding fledgling
   cowbirds. In 97 cases, observers did not record hosts feeding their own
   young, suggesting that many young die shortly after fledging from
   parasitized nests. These observations suggest that measuring the cost of
   parasitism as the difference between the number of host young fledged
   from parasitized and unparasitized nests probably overestimates the
   reproductive output of many hosts. If costs increase during the
   fledgling stage, then the costs of brood parasitism have been
   underestimated in many studies.}},

Abstract = {{Anecdotal evidence suggests that Burrowing Owls have declined in the
   state of Washington. We examined the status of these owls in
   agricultural and urban habitats to better understand the underlying
   causes of these declines. Nest density was higher in the area dominated
   by agriculture (0.67 nests/km(2)) than in the urban area (0.28
   nests/km(2)), and re-use of nest burrows was more common in the
   agricultural area. We found no difference in mean clutch size between
   the two areas, but nesting success was higher in the agricultural area.
   The mean number of fledglings per nesting attempt was higher in the
   agricultural area (2.02 vs. 1.47), but we found no difference between
   the two areas in the mean number of fledglings per successful nest (3.2
   vs. 3.1). Both natal recruitment (4\% vs. 8\%) and annual return rate of
   adults (30\% vs. 39\%) were lower in the agricultural area than in the
   urban area, suggesting that the owl population in the agricultural area
   may not be stable and may be a ``sink{''} population. Due to high burrow
   fidelity from year to year, and the tendency of some owls in Washington
   to overwinter, we recommend that legal protection of nest burrows be
   extended to the nonbreeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms used by birds to rang their distance from singing
   conspecifics are being debated. In particular, the idea that an incoming
   song must be in a bird's repertoire for it to be ranged accurately is
   controversial, but important to our appreciation of the role ranging
   plays in song evolution. We tested the relation between ranging accuracy
   and songs in repertoires in playback experiments to male Blue-headed
   Vireos (Vireo solitarius) whose precise locations were known because
   they were incubating eggs. Males ranged songs heard while incubating
   and, when their mates relieved them at the nest, flew directly to the
   silent playback sites, suggesting that they remembered the locations of
   simulated intruders. Male vireos approached playback sites of local
   songs, likely in their own repertoires, more precisely than foreign
   songs recorded 95-645 km from our study site. Songs included in local
   and foreign playback tapes differed primarily in frequency modulation,
   but were similar in other measurements. These results support ranging
   theory as described by Morton (1986). If the songs within an
   individual's repertoire are ranged with greater accuracy we discuss how
   the stability of neighborhoods becomes a factor as to whether or not
   selection will favor repertoire sharing in song evolution. As well,
   singing style is affected by ranging. Because Blue-headed Vireos present
   their songs in a stereotyped order, a listener can compare ordered
   sequential changes in signal degradation. Comparing degradation in a
   sequence of songs adds a temporal element that should result in more
   accurate ranging of the singer's location.}},

Abstract = {{Various indices of reproductive activity (IRA) have been used to
   estimate the reproductive success of songbirds. However, the performance
   of IRAs varies among systems examined, and this approach still requires
   more effort than standard surveys. We tested the accuracy of an IRA in a
   survey of birds nesting in bogs in eastern New Brunswick, Canada. We
   compared an IRA obtained through point counts with playbacks
   ({''}extensive{''} IRA) to another IRA obtained through intensive
   searches for evidence of breeding ({''}intensive{''} IRA) by Palm
   Warblers (Dendroica palmarum). Both the extensive IRA and associated
   abundance index were correlated with the intensive IRA, the former
   correlation being stronger. However, the extensive IRA tended to
   underestimate the status of breeding birds and overestimate the statu of
   no reproducing individuals that behaved more conspicuously. Nonetheless,
   the extensive IRA obtained using song playbacks represents a
   time-efficient alternative to intensive nest monitoring when estimating
   habitat quality at the scale of small (0.78 ha) study plots.}},

Abstract = {{Once the most abundant large tern in California, populations of Royal
   Terns (Thalasseus Maximus) are now greatly reduced statewide. However,
   these terns are still common in southern California where the population
   appears to be increasing. We estimated survival of this species, for
   which no robust estimate of survival is available, using mark-resighting
   data. Apparent survival of birds > 3 yr of age was estimated to be
   similar to 0.95; first-year survival was owe at 0.86. Re lower survival
   estimate for first-year birds probably reflects increased mortality, but
   could also be a function of permanent emigration by individuals in this
   age class. The adult survival probability is the highest reported among
   terns and suggests that survival is playing an important role in the
   recovery of this tern population and that the current population growth
   is not solely due to immigration. Improvements in resighting protocols,
   marking technology, and mark-recapture methods are recommended to better
   use live resighting, dead recovery, and multistate data.}},

Abstract = {{Raptors and other large birds in soaring flight take advantage of upward
   drafts of air called thermals to maintain altitude with minimal
   flapping. I us;e a Doppler light detection and ranging (lidar) system to
   characterize a thermal in which raptors were soaring. Doppler lidar
   allows imaging of wind fields to reveal the structure of updrafts and
   downdrafts in a thermal. The thermal I monitored was in the form of a
   horizontal convective roll created at a transition from clear sky to
   partly cloudy sky, and gave both lift and lateral motion to the soaring
   birds. The thermal was 700 in high with a vertical wind speed that
   peaked at 3 m/s, so raptors could have soared to and maintained that
   altitude as the horizontal wind moved the thermal. My results suggest
   that imaging wind fields with Doppler lidar can be a useful tool for
   studying thermals and how they are used by soaring birds. An effective
   combination for further study of bird flight interaction with wind
   phenomena would be to add lidar measurements to an established means of
   tracking bird flight by radio or GPS transmitters, aircraft tracking, or
   radar.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies using thermal imaging cameras (TI) have used target
   size as an indicator of target altitude when radar was not available, C
   this approach may lead to errors if birds that differ greatly in size
   are actually flying at the same altitude. To overcome this potential
   difficulty and obtain more accurate measures of the flight altitudes and
   numbers of individual migrants, we have developed a technique that
   combines a vertically pointed stationary radar beam and a vertically
   pointed thermal imaging camera (VERTRAD/TI). The TI provides accurate
   counts of the birds passing through a fixed, circular sampling area in
   the TI display, and the radar provides accurate data on their flight
   altitudes. We analyzed samples of VERTRAD/TI video data collected during
   nocturnal fall migration in 2000 and 2003 and during the arrival of
   spring trans-Gulf migration during the daytime in 2003. We used a video
   peak store (VPS) to make time exposures of target tracks in the video
   record of the TI and developed criteria to distinguish birds, foraging
   bats, and insects based on characteristics of the tracks in the VPS
   images and the altitude of the targets. The TI worked equally well
   during daytime and nighttime observations and best when skies were
   clear, because thermal radiance from cloud heat often obscured targets.
   The V-ERTRAD/TI system, though costly, is a valuable tool for measuring
   accurate bird migration traffic rates (the number of birds crossing
   1609.34 in {[}I statute mile] of front per hour) for different
   altitudinal strata above 25 in. The technique can be used to estimate
   the potential risk of migrating birds colliding with man-made obstacles
   of various heights (e.g., communication and broadcast towers and wind
   turbines)-a subject of increasing importance to conservation biologists.}},

Abstract = {{For burrow-nesting seabirds, investigators have examined nestling diet
   by attaching harnesses to the bills of nestlings; to intercept food
   delivered by the parent. To determine whether this method provides an
   unbiased estimate of nestling diet, we evaluated its effect on the
   provisioning behavior of Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) nesting on
   Triangle Island, British Columbia. Adults delivering food to nestlings
   with bill harnesses always hesitated before entering a burrow with food,
   increasing their susceptibility to kleptoparasitism by gulls, and did
   not always leave the food intended for the nestling. These responses by
   adult puffins could lead to underestimates of energy intake rates of
   nestlings and unreliable comparisons with other species if prey left by
   adults in nest burrows were the only source of data. We also compared
   estimates of the species, number, and size of prey delivered by adult
   puffins as determined by direct observation from blinds to samples of
   prey collected directly from nest burrows and found that the two
   sampling techniques produced similar results. However, identifying rare
   prey species and gathering precise information about prey length, mass,
   and condition require collection of prey, and we recommend using a
   combination of techniques to obtain the most reliable estimates of
   nestling diet.}},

Abstract = {{Banding birds is essential for detailed demographic studies of avian
   populations. Mist nets are a widely used, effective method of capturing
   birds for banding, but are difficult to use under certain conditions.
   While conducting a demographic study of Southwestern Willow Flycatchers
   (Empidonax traillii extimus), rising reservoir levels flooded large
   tracts of flycatcher breeding habitat and made traditional mist-netting
   techniques impossible to use. In response, we devised a technique for
   capturing birds over deep water using mist nets suspended between poles
   kept afloat on compact buoys. In 2005, we used this technique to safely
   capture 17 Willow Flycatchers that could not have been captured by any
   other means, and over 40 additional passerines were incidentally
   captured with no injuries occurring. This versatile apparatus was simple
   to build and employ, and capture success was similar to that over dry
   land.}},

Abstract = {{Orientation of nests can influence nest microclimate, particularly
   temperature. However, few investigators have examined orientation
   preference and microclimate simultaneously. We examined the possible
   correlation between entrance orientation of artificial nest boxes used
   by Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and the internal temperature of
   boxes. Tree Swallows showed a preference for east- and south-facing
   boxes, but only during the first half of the breeding season (before I
   June). During the second half of the breeding season (after 1 June),
   Swallows selected boxes based on availability. We found that east- and
   south-facing boxes were warmer than north- and west-facing boxes, but
   only during the first half of the breeding season when those boxes were
   preferred. Entrance orientation and box temperature were only correlated
   during the morning (06:00-12:00); the temperature of all boxes was
   similar during the afternoon. Our results suggest that Tree Swallows
   show a preference for nest boxes with a certain entrance orientation
   only when orientation influences microclimate, suggesting that warmer
   nest temperatures may provide fitness benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Data from roosts of Amazona parrots may be useful in creating
   demographic models, because these birds exhibit high roost fidelity and
   pairs are conspicuous in flight. However, few investigators have
   attempted to track changes in the number of pairs using such roosts. We
   studied Red-lored Amazons (Amazona autumnalis) at a communal roost in
   southwest Ecuador over a 1-yr period to understand better their
   population structure. Population size was estimated at 214 individuals.
   Counts revealed seasonal variation in numbers, but the occurrence of
   pairs and singles was seldom correlated. The number of paired
   individuals using the roost was lower during the breeding period. In
   contrast, the number of single birds at the roost nearly doubled during
   the breeding period. Overall, our data suggest that parental
   responsibilities during the nesting period explain fluctuations in the
   number of birds at the roost, and such fluctuations can be used to
   estimate the reproductive portion of the population. Protection of the
   small mangrove islands where the parrots roost would likely benefit a
   population that occupies a much larger area and would, at the same time,
   provide a useful tool for demographic studies of this poorly known
   neotropical parrot.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the hypothesis that social group size in Mexican Jays
   (Aphelocoma ultramarina) varies with habitat structure. We counted the
   social group size of Mexican Jays over a range of elevations and forest
   types in a single mountain range in northern Mexico (Sierra El Carmen,
   Coahuila). Group size increased significantly with elevation, in
   contrast to a population of Mexican Jays in Arizona that showed no such
   trend in another study. Among the vegetation variables measured, those
   relating to size of pines and oaks were especially important in
   explaining variation in group size. Because acorns and pine nuts are a
   major part of the diet of Mexican Jays, sites with larger oaks and pines
   may produce larger nut crops and support larger groups of jays.
   Elevation did not significantly explain variance in group size after
   taking vegetation into account. We compared group size and habitat
   variation across different parts of the geographic range of Mexican
   Jays. Our analysis indicates that variation of social group size in
   Mexican Jays is influenced by habitat quality at both local and
   geographic scales. Detailed studies on habitat structure and
   demographics of this population are needed to further clarify aspects of
   habitat quality important to these jays, and the mechanisms by which
   variation in social structure is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Bands are a common marking method in bird studies and
   capture-mark-reencounter (CMR) models are often used to analyze banding
   data. Common to this family of models are two assumptions: marks do not
   fall off or become unreadable and individuals within groups remain
   equally detectable. When data fail to meet these assumptions, results of
   CMR analyses may be biased. In studies of long-lived seabirds exposed to
   coarse nesting substrates, band wear is especially problematic. We
   compared surface wear from abrasion against rocks on incoloy and darvic
   bands applied to a long-lived seabird, the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula
   arctica). In 2003 and 2004, surface wear on bands applied to chicks and
   adults was scored at five colonies in the Gulf of Maine. We used
   logistic regression to analyze two subsets of these data by fitting the
   probability of being worn (one or more characters difficult to read or
   obliterated) to band age, bird age, and band type. In both analyses, an
   evidence ratio provided exclusive support for the model that included
   all factors. Immature puffins largely avoid colonies and remain at sea
   until their second or third summer after hatching. Consequently,
   probabilities of being worn were delayed on both band types by 4 yr on
   bands applied to chicks compared to adults. Based on our estimates, 25\%
   and 87\% of darvic bands applied to chicks and adults, respectively,
   were worn after 5 yr. Wear was reduced by 71\% and 87\% annually on
   incoloy compared to darvic bands applied to adults and chicks,
   respectively. To uphold assumptions of CMR models, we recommend incoloy
   bands over darvic in studies spanning more than about 5 yr of long-lived
   seabirds exposed to coarse substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial behavior of Broad-tailed (Selasphorous platycercus) and
   Rufous (Selasphorous rufus) hummingbirds in Colorado was measured at
   sites with feeders containing10\%, 20\%, and 30\% sucrose solutions,
   respectively. The presence or absence of territory holders, number of
   intruders, and intensity of defense were measured at the three levels of
   energy availability. Migrating Rufous Hummingbirds displaced
   Broad-tailed Hummingbirds from territories they had defended during the
   breeding season; Broad-tailed Hummingbirds then defended only lower
   quality sites. Both Broad-tailed and Rufous hummingbirds employed more
   energetically expensive behaviors when defending high quality sites,
   with longer chases more often supplemented with chip calls and hovering.
   Other investigators have suggested that chip calls and hovering are
   precursors to a chase. However, I found that chasing was the default
   response to the presence of an intruder. Chip calls and hovering were
   added to intensify a chase. In the few cases where chip calls were
   uttered or hovering occurred without a chase, Rufous Hummingbirds were
   more likely to exhibit this behavior than Broad-tailed Hummingbirds.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the deleterious effects of using an antimony potassium
   tartrate emetic to obtain diet samples from birds, and compare
   information obtained from regurgitated samples versus fecal samples in
   describing diets of autumn migrants. We also examined dose effectiveness
   in captive Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) subjected to the same
   emetic technique used in the field. Over 70\% of migrants given an
   emetic at a study site in Idaho regurgitated useful samples. For 5 of 7
   species analyzed, regurgitated samples produced significantly more
   arthropods per sample than fecal samples, and one species, Warbling
   Vireo, showed higher numbers of distinct arthropod taxa per sample. In
   most species, regurgitated samples accumulated arthropod taxa more
   quickly than fecal samples. However, increasing the number of fecal
   samples by 5-17 produced a similar number of taxa. Diet composition
   based on fecal versus regurgitated samples was generally similar, but
   there were significant differences. Two of 130 treated migrants died
   soon after treatment. Recapture frequency for treated birds was less
   than half that for untreated birds, but it is not clear whether this
   difference was due to treatment-related mortality or emigration. Each
   treated bird that we recaptured had lost mass and this suggests a
   deleterious effect because untreated migrants tended to gain mass. In
   captivity, 18 Dark-eyed Juncos were treated with emetic: 6 with the full
   mass-specific recommended dose, 6 with half the recommended dose, and
   the final 6 with one quarter the recommended dose. All were alive 15-20
   min posttreatment (recommended release time), but 17 of 18 died within
   30 min after receiving the emetic. Together, our data suggest that
   although the emetic technique may be slightly more information-rich in
   assessing diet, it is more harmful than previously reported especially
   in certain species and should be used only after adequate consideration
   of the immediate mortality and short-term physiological effects on birds
   to be studied.}},

Abstract = {{Feathers are increasingly collected as a nondestructive source of DNA
   for avian genetic research. Although feather samples are not optimal in
   some important ways than more robust blood or tissue samples, feather
   sampling requires less training for field workers, results in shorter
   handling times for the organism, generates no hazardous wastes, and
   requires simpler storage procedures. Along with these largely positive
   attributes comes a set of challenges, particularly the relatively low
   copy number of DNA present in feather samples. We compared the utility
   and reliability of feathers to the more traditional blood samples as
   sources of DNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular
   sexing of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapilla). DNA from 102
   individuals was extracted separately from both single rectrices and from
   blood samples, and the sex of each bird was then determined using
   standard PCR-based methods. We found complete agreement between sex
   determinations based on feather versus blood DNA extractions. Slight
   variations in lab protocols were necessary to obtain consistent results
   from these two DNA sources; and we briefly discuss other sources of
   error that could occur in feather-based molecular sexing studies. This
   controlled comparison of feather versus blood samples demonstrates that
   plucked rectrices provide a highly reliable source of DNA for molecular
   sexing of wild birds.}},

Abstract = {{Many birds undergo bare part color changes during the breeding season.
   Most investigators have focused on color as a signal of individual
   quality. An alternative, but not exclusive, function of bare part color
   may be signaling readiness to breed, especially in colonial,
   asynchronous breeders. White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) are colonial
   waterbirds that show vivid bare part colors on their bills and legs
   during reproduction. We quantified bill and leg colors to describe color
   changes and their possible relationship to reproductive status during
   the breeding season of White Ibises in the Florida Everglades from 1998
   to 2001. We also examined the correlation between bare part colors and
   circulating concentrations of sex steroids to understand the factors
   that regulate bare part colors. During the display stage, male and
   female ibises developed dark pink bills and scarlet legs. As the
   breeding season progressed, bills and legs faded and developed a muted
   pink hue. The bare part colors of female ibises were correlated with
   testosterone concentrations, but those of male ibises were not
   correlated with any hormones. A discriminant function analysis based on
   principal component scores (representing variation in saturation and
   hue) and the amount of black on the bill successfully classified ibis
   reproductive stage 94\% of the time. The use of bare part colors to
   determine reproductive status may be useful for studying reproduction in
   colonially nesting birds, where access to breeding sites can be
   difficult and potential for researcher disturbance is high.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of marine birds relative to water clarity was examined
   in the nearshore waters of Monterey Bay, California. I conducted nine
   at-sea surveys in 1999 and 2000 and simultaneously recorded water
   clarity and the density of five taxa of marine birds. Among
   plunge-divers, Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) occurred more
   frequently than expected over turbid water (< 2.5 m Secchi depth) and,
   among pursuit-diving species, Brandt's Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   penicillatus) occurred most often in the clearest water available (> 5 m
   Secchi depth). Turbidity in Monterey Bay may be caused by suspended
   organic matter, including phytoplankton, during summer and fall.
   Forster's Tern may prefer such areas because small fish are likely to
   occur near this potential food source. Brandt's Cormorants probably rely
   on vision to catch fish near the bottom and turbid water may reduce
   available light and limit visual acuity. The distribution of Brown
   Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), Western/Clark's Grebes (Aechmophorus
   occidentalis/clarkii), and Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
   did not appear to be influenced by turbidity levels, indicating that
   some seabirds use marine habitats with a wide range of water clarities.}},

Abstract = {{In at least 15 species of woodpeckers, the inner primaries of nestlings

   (Melanerpes formicivorus) at Hastings Reservation in central coastal
   California, where most nestlings (90.1\%) had reduced first and second
   primaries, 9.8\% had only a reduced first primary, and 0.1\% had no
   reduced primaries. More males (11.1\%) had large second primaries than
   did females (5.3\%), and females with this trait were less likely to
   survive their first year of life. Smaller inner primaries may provide a
   temporary energetic savings for nestlings that facilitate faster growth,
   but, if so, why this trait is not more common among other cavity-nesting
   species remains unknown. This trait appears to be more ecologically
   interesting than previously suspected and warrants study in other

Abstract = {{Egg flotation was used to estimate incubation age and eggshell evidence
   was collected to determine nest fate at nests of 11 species of
   shorebirds on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska during 2002-2004. We
   present egg-flotation schedules for nine species to facilitate the
   estimation of nest age. We evaluated the predictive ability of an
   egg-flotation schedule for Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla)
   and were able to estimate incubation age within similar to 1-3 d of the
   assumed age. Patterns of eggshell evidence were similar across species,
   with eggshell fragments (1-5 mm) present at most successful nests (96\%)
   and eggshell tops or bottoms present only at successful nests. We
   determined nest fate independently of eggshell evidence and then used
   discriminant function analysis to predict the probability of correctly
   classifying a nest's fate using different types of eggshell evidence.
   The use of eggshell fragment evidence resulted in the correct
   classification of the fate of all 11 species of shorebirds in 92\% of
   the cases. Both the egg-flotation technique and eggshell evidence can be
   used in future studies to calculate accurate measures of reproductive
   success needed for ecological investigations of shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{The Louisiana Waterthrush (waterthrush; Seiurus motacilla) is a
   forest-dwelling, Nearctic-Neotropical migratory passerine that nests
   along streams. We attached radiotransmitters (0.6-0.8 g) to 12 nestling
   waterthrushes using snug, elastic loops. At three nests, adult
   waterthrushes were videotaped removing radio-tagged young from the nest.
   In addition, we recovered nine radio-backpacks (with two still attached
   to the carcasses of nestlings) near nests within a few days after
   attaching transmitters. Only one of 12 radio-tagged young was relocated
   more than 24 h after attaching the transmitter. Thus, the method of
   transmitter attachment we used was not effective. Using snug, nonelastic
   loops (e.g., nylon) for the harness may reduce the loss of transmitters,
   but may injure the skin as fledglings grow. Other possible alternatives
   include (1) gluing the transmitter to skin on the back of nestlings, (2)
   capturing fledglings in mist nets and attaching transmitters a week or
   more after fledging by which time contour feathers have grown and the
   likelihood of a parent removing the transmitter may be reduced, or (3)
   attempting to monitor fledglings without attaching transmitters. The
   success of the latter two alternatives would likely be enhanced by
   attaching transmitters to adults and then tracking them to locate their
   still-dependent fledglings.}},

Abstract = {{Although ephemeral ponds act as small hotspots of plant, invertebrate,
   and salamander diversity, the importance of such ponds for birds has
   been little studied. We hypothesized that ephemeral ponds on the
   Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee would support a greater abundance,
   richness, and diversity of birds than the surrounding hardwood forests.
   In 2004, we recorded all birds seen or heard in 10 min within 50-m
   radius circles at 25 ephemeral ponds. We repeated the counts at control
   sites located 150 m from each pond in the surrounding forest. To
   quantify potential food availability, we captured aerial invertebrates
   using sweep nets at four points around a subsample of eight ephemeral
   ponds and at an equal number of control sites. We found significantly
   greater bird abundance, richness, and species diversity at ephemeral
   ponds than at control sites, and that pond area was not associated with
   either bird abundance or richness. Bird community composition at pond
   and control sites was similar. Aerial invertebrates were significantly
   more abundant at ephemeral ponds than at adjacent forest sites,
   providing one possible explanation for greater bird abundance at
   ephemeral ponds.}},

Title = {{Effect of floating nest platforms on the breeding performance of Black

Abstract = {{In 2003 and 2004, we placed 41 floating nest platforms on Grassy Lake in
   southeastern Wisconsin (USA) to test the hypothesis that reproductive
   success of Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) is limited by the quality of
   suitable nesting habitat. Extreme differences in water levels between
   these 2 yr provided a natural experiment to evaluate the effectiveness
   of the nest platforms during a drought year (2003) when natural nesting
   substrate was abundant, and a flood year (2004) when natural substrate
   was limited during the peak nesting period. Terns nested on 27 of 41
   (66\%) of the platforms in 2003 and 26 of 41 (63\%) in 2004. No
   difference in the occupancy rate of platforms and natural nests was
   evident in 2003, but the pattern of clutch initiations early in the
   season in 2004 indicated that platforms were preferred over natural
   substrates. In 2003, nest survival rates did not differ between nests
   placed on platforms and those placed on natural substrates, but platform
   nests had significantly higher hatching success and nest survival rates
   in 2004. Both the Kaplan-Meier and Apparent Nest Success methods of
   calculating nest survival provided similar estimates. In both years,
   eggs laid on platforms were significantly larger than those laid on
   natural substrates, suggesting that platforms were occupied by
   high-quality birds. Our study indicates that floating nest platforms can
   be an effective management tool to enhance nesting habitat for Black
   Terns and other aquatic birds that construct floating nests, primarily
   because platforms provide nest sites when natural sites are not
   available due to flooding. Nest platforms also may be useful for
   addressing questions concerning habitat selection and parental quality.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the extent and causes of band-related leg injuries in an
   Australian passerine, the Bell Miner (Manorina melanophrys). Eight
   percent of banded birds exhibited leg injuries, and most were birds with
   two plastic color bands on a tarsus. Leg injuries typically followed the
   accumulation of shed tarsal scales under the color bands. Color bands
   used on Bell Miners were tighter on the tarsus than the metal band and
   also tighter than the color bands used on Superb Fairy-wrens (Malurus
   cyaneus), a commonly banded species with no reported leg injuries. The
   tendency for scales to accumulate under two plastic color bands appeared
   to be influenced by the diameter of a band relative to the size of a
   bird's tarsus (with looser bands less likely to cause accumulation) and
   the material used to make the band (with smoother surfaces less likely
   to cause accumulation). Celluloid color bands had rougher internal
   surfaces than either Darvic or metal bands. In addition, both celluloid
   and Darvic color bands generated static electricity capable of
   attracting tarsal scales. Scales that accumulated under bands provided
   an environment where potentially harmful fungi became established,
   potentially contributing to the severity of leg injuries. Our results
   suggest that, when selecting an appropriate band size for a bird, the
   diameter of the tarsus at its midpoint should occupy only between 60\%
   and 65\% of the internal diameter of the band and, when possible, a
   single, bicolored, anodized aluminum alloy band should be used instead
   of multiple plastic color bands.}},

   of lunar light conditions on the detection probability of
   Whip-poor-wills through repeated sampling of 78 point count stations
   over two lunar cycles. The probability of detection was positively
   related to moonlight intensity measured as the percentage of moon-face
   illuminated and moon height above the horizon. These results were used
   to show how the reliability of long-term monitoring strategies can be
   improved by sampling design. Surveys conducted on nights when the
   moon-face was > 50\% illuminated were less variable and provided more
   statistical power to long-term monitoring results compared to surveys
   that were conducted across all nights. Stratifying surveys for
   Whip-poor-wills during bright moonlight provides greater statistical
   power for monitoring programs, which inevitably allows better scientific
   conclusions to be drawn from collected data.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of nest starts are often used as indicators of the size of avian
   nesting populations, or of avian productivity. However, the accuracy of
   single or repeated counts of unmarked nests over time for estimating
   seasonal numbers of nests may be strongly affected by nest events that
   fall in between survey dates, or that occurred prior to or after the
   survey period. Accuracy may also be affected by uncertainty in the
   interpretation of counts due to overlap between starting and ending
   dates of asynchronous nests during the intervisit interval. To measure
   the combined magnitude of these effects on survey accuracy, we overlaid
   a monthly ``survey{''} regime on known initiation and ending dates of
   2055 nests of ciconiiform birds. Assuming all nests present on the date
   of simulated survey were counted, monthly surveys underestimated the
   true number of nest starts by 24-64\%, depending on species and year.
   Using a simple model, we also demonstrate that accuracy does not
   increase much as survey frequency increases, and that significant
   estimation error can occur over a wide range of nest success values and
   degrees of asynchrony. We suggest that (1) these biases can be
   significant for surveys of many kinds of nesting birds including some

Abstract = {{Studies of the dynamics of carcass components are critical to
   understanding survival and reproduction in waterfowl. Here, we examined
   the influence of sex, age, and season on the carcass composition of
   American Wigeon (Anas americana) in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of
   Texas during the migration and wintering periods. Wigeon (N = 621) were
   collected from late fall through early spring, and carcass components
   (lipid, protein, and mineral) were estimated for each bird. Overall,
   carcass mass and lipids increased from autumn to early or midwinter and
   declined thereafter. However, over-winter changes in carcass reserves
   differed among sex and age groups. Wigeon of different sex and age
   groups maintained lipid and protein reserves to different degrees and
   used those reserves through the winter at different rates. The lack of
   premigratory fattening suggests that wigeon in the SHP must obtain most
   of the resources necessary for reproduction en route to breeding
   grounds, and highlights the importance of suitable stopover locations on
   their migratory routes. Changes in mean structural size of wigeon
   sampled during the nonbreeding season, in conjunction with genetic data,
   suggest that the wintering population in the SHP was composed of birds
   from several breeding populations. Our research will aid migratory bird
   biologists in determining how wigeon that differ in sex and age meet
   their over-winter resource needs, and in evaluating the responses of
   wigeon to habitat conservation and management efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation-oriented studies of Micronesian Kingfishers (Todiramphus
   cinnamominus) have been hindered by a lack of basic natural history
   information, despite the status of the Guam subspecies (T. c.
   cinnamominus) as one of the most endangered species in the world. We
   used tissue samples and morphometric measures from museum specimens and
   wild-captured Pohnpei Micronesian Kingfishers (T. c. reichenbachii) to
   develop methods for sex determination. We present a modified molecular
   protocol and a discriminant function that yields the probability that a
   particular individual is male or female. Our results revealed that
   females were significantly larger than males, and the discriminant
   function correctly predicted sex in 73\% (30/41) of the individuals. The
   sex of 86\% (18/21) of individuals was correctly assigned when a
   moderate reliability threshold was set. Sex determination using
   molecular genetic techniques was more reliable than methods based on
   morphology. Our results will facilitate recovery efforts for the
   critically endangered Guam Micronesian Kingfisher and provide a basis
   for sex determination in the 11 other endangered congeners in the

Abstract = {{Omnidirectional bioacoustic recording systems offer the ability to
   record forest songbirds in the field by technical staff, and then
   interpret the recordings later in the laboratory by skilled
   interpreters. Among several advantages to this approach are the ability
   to estimate variance among interpreters, obtain a permanent archival
   record of the point Count, reduce costs by using regular field crews to
   collect data vs. those skilled in bird identification, and remove
   impediments to breeding bird surveys due to lack of available skilled
   birders. In this study we first evaluated the effects of microphone
   configuration and digital processing methods on the quality and
   effectiveness of the recordings, and then evaluated how consistently
   skilled birders interpreted the same songbird recordings collected under
   a mix of environmental conditions, and related this to the commonness of
   the species. At the time of this evaluation, the most cost-effective
   configuration of the bioacoustic monitoring system included use of a
   180degrees/180degrees microphone combination, a minidisc digital
   recording system, analog transfer of the sound data via a digital
   soundcard, post-processing amplification of the signal, and data storage
   in an MP3 format. This combination maintains high sound fidelity while
   minimizing both expense and data storage requirements. As recording
   device technology improves, the direct storage and digital transfer of
   WAV format files will be the preferred and most effective recording
   option. Despite noisy conditions due to wind and other ambient sounds
   for many of the recordings, interpreters showed a high level of
   similarity in species identification and enumeration for the 34 most
   abundant species. Standardized coefficient of variance increased sharply
   when species had fewer than 10 occurrences, suggesting that birders are
   more variable in their identification of rare or uncommon species.
   Desktop identification systems that include type specimens of
   spectrographic signature and sound clips to aid interpreters could
   improve identification accuracy of rarer species.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of chick Survival rates is required to develop
   species-specific habitat-survival relationships. We determined
   pre-flight daily survival of Rio Grande Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo
   intermedia) chicks from hatching to time of tree roost at four sites in
   southwestern Kansas and the Texas Rolling Plains, May-August, 2000 and
   2001. One-hundred rwenty-three chicks from 39 broods were equipped with
   cyanoacrylate-attached transmitters. The first day of brood tree-roost
   ranged from 9-16 d after hatching. Chick survival to 16 d of age ranged
   from 0. 11 to 0.67. Onehundred percent of mortalities in 2000 and 70\%
   of mortalities in 2001 for chicks 0-16 d old occurred <10 d after
   hatching. Survival at two of four sites was higher for 10-16 d-old
   chicks than 0-9 d-old chicks. Combining different survival periods may
   cause biased results When examining habitat-SUrvival relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional methods of examining the nest contents of burrow-nesting
   birds have often been destructive, expensive, and/or limited to
   large-bodied species. Here we present details of a small, efficient, and
   inexpensive ``burrowscope{''} designed for examining the nest tunnels of
   very small birds. The burrowscope consists of a tiny (16 min X 22 mm)
   video camera and infrared light-emitting diodes, Mounted on the end of
   flexible conduit (20-min diameter) that houses a live video feed to a
   small, hand-held monitor display. In total, the burrowscope is only 22
   turn wide at its widest point, weighs approximately 900 g, and was built
   for less than US \$400. The burrowscope was tested in the field and
   could be Used at 99.8\% of Rainbow Bee-eater (Merops ornatus) nests and
   100\% of Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotuspunctatus) nests (one of the
   world's smallest burrow-nesting birds). The accuracy of the burrowscope
   was evaluated by excavating a nest access hole at a sub-sample of
   Rainbow Bee-eater nests. The burrowscope enabled precise determination
   Of Clutch size at 30 of 30 nests, and brood size at 125 of 127 nests.
   The equipment Could be applied to other organisms, including some
   invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, and burrow-nesting mammals.}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-32}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Each autumn, American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in the Central
   Valley of California, USA, forage heavily on walnut trees (Juglans
   regia) planted along residential streets. Some of these nuts are dropped
   onto roads and cracked for immediate consumption, but others are carried
   away from foraging sites to be cached. I quantified caching behavior to
   understand its importance in corvid natural history and the potential
   for corvids to disperse large tree seeds. Crows cached an estimated 2000
   walnuts/km(2)/yr in agricultural fields 1-2 km away. Most (73\%) crows
   that found a walnut left the foraging site with it, and most (77\%) of
   these crows cached their nuts. Some crows carried walnuts long distances
   (e.g., 5\% of nuts foraged from trees were carried >2 km) and buried
   them in unforested habitat; this indicates that crows may be agents of
   tree seed dispersal. Transporting and caching a nut required
   approximately 10 min and increased the likelihood of it being stolen,
   relative to a nut eaten immediately at the walnut tree. Without knowing
   the timing and rates of recovery, it is unclear when and to what degree
   American Crows benefit from walnut-caching, which has not been
   previously described in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), a declining species of
   Nearctic shorebird, winters as far north as Humboldt Bay, California,
   where it feeds principally in intertidal habitats but shifts to pastures
   with onset of seasonal rains. We Studied variation in abundance and
   behavior of curlews in coastal pastures in relation to environmental
   variation that may influence the profitability of intertidal and pasture
   habitats as foraging sites. Curlews occurred in greater abundance in
   pastures during morning hours, when intertidal habitats were exposed for
   longer intervals during daylight hours, and coincident with greater
   rainfall. While using pastures, most curlews fed, and this proportion
   varied positively with intervals of lower tides in intertidal habitats.
   Pastures provide important foraging habitat for approximately one third
   of the 200-300 Curlews wintering at Humboldt Bay, especially when
   inclement weather makes foraging in intertidal habitats difficult and
   increases food availability in pastures.}},

Abstract = {{We compared direct observation methods to assess the diet of nestling
   Bearded Vultures in the Pyrenees northeastern Spain. Using video cameras
   and telescopes, diet was determined from observations of food items
   delivered to, and prey remains in, nests. Using video cameras, the
   proportion of prey identified in remains in nests was significantly
   greater than that identified using telescopes, but no differences were
   found in food items delivered to the nest and in the species composition
   of the diet. Data suggest that the proportion of prey identified in food
   items delivered was greater than that identified in prey remains. Prey
   remains and food items delivered grouped by taxa showed significant
   differences, with the remains underrepresenting small prey. By combining
   data on prey remains and food items delivered, these biases can be
   reduced or eliminated. The results suggest that the combination of prey
   remains and food items delivered allow one to increase sample size
   without biases and thus to optimize the considerable investment in time
   that this method of direct observation involves.}},

Abstract = {{We compared transect counts used for the annual official count of male
   Kirtland's Warblers (Dendroica kirtlandii) to an observation-based
   mapping method of individually sighted males in 155 stands over 10 yrs.
   The annual census count almost tripled from 1990 to 1999. The transect
   and observation-based mapping method showed the same increasing trend in
   population between 1990 and 1999, except from 1992 to 1993. The annual
   official census transect count was consistently higher than the mapping
   method for stands censused in common. After standardizing for sample
   size, the annual number of Kirtland's Warblers per stand increased
   through time with the transect method, while there was a positive,
   non-significant trend with the mapping method. After 1992, the two
   methods began diverging in the number of males per stand. The
   relationship between the differences in count between methods (mapping
   count minus transect count) to the official transect count varied among
   years. At the stand level, the transect-method count was greater than
   the mapping count in 60\% of the stands, while the mapping count was
   greater than the transect count in 16.3\% of the stands. The difference
   in count between methods at the stand level ranged from -43 to +10. We
   illustrate the difficulties with interpreting transect counts due to
   Kirtland's Warblers' large territory sizes, occasional double
   territories, and active territorial defense during early morning hours.
   We suggest improvements to help correct these Sources of error. We
   conclude that the official census transect counts are a satisfactory
   relative index, but results should not be interpreted as an absolute
   count.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the breeding biology of the Le Conte's Sparrow
   (Ammodranuis leconteh), probably because of its secretive nature. We
   provide new information on several aspects of Le Conte's Sparrow
   breeding biology, including rates of nest parasitism by Brown-headed
   Cowbirds (Molothrusater) and potential factors affecting breeding
   densities and nesting success of the species. Our study was conducted in
   the tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North
   Dakota during 1998-2002. Breeding densities varied among years, but this
   variation was not clearly linked to climatic patterns. Vegetation had
   some influence on densities of Le Conte's Sparrows; densities were
   highest in grasslands with moderate amounts of bare ground. Prairie
   patch size and the percentage of shrubs and trees in the landscape had
   no recognizable influence on density. Nesting Success was highly
   variable among sites and years and increased slightly with distance from
   trees. Rates of nest parasitism were low (1 of 50 nests parasitized),
   and clutch sizes were similar to those of other studies of Le Conte's
   Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{We studied short-term responses by 16 species of breeding landbirds to
   group-selection timber harvest at four 21.2-ha replicated study stands
   in montane hardwood-conifer habitat in the central Sierra Nevada
   Mountains, California, 1995-2002. The group-selection timber harvest was
   done to enhance stand conditions for California black oak (Quercus
   kelloggii), the dominant hardwood. Birds were censused using point
   counts, and harvesting effects were assessed using the
   Before-After/Control-Impact Pairs (BACIP) design where the response
   variables were the differences in landbird abundances between paired
   treatment and control plots for pre- and posttreatment periods. Each
   stand had paired and adjacent 10.6-ha treatment and control plots, and
   four 0.6-ha groupselection units were randomly placed and harvested in
   each treatment plot in 1998 and 1999. In the treatment plots, tree basal
   areas and tree densities were reduced approximately 30\% and snag
   densities were reduced approximately 45\% with the harvest. Abundance
   differences between pre- and post-treatment periods differed among
   stands for 11 (69\%) species. Significant differences in abundance
   between the pre- and post-treatment periods were found for Stellers Jays
   (Cyanocitta stelleri), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western
   Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus). Significant interactions between
   stands and treatment periods were found for Evening Grosbeaks
   (Coccothraustes vespertinus) and Western Wood-Pewees, indicating that
   responses differed among stands. Significant differences between
   treatment periods were due to proportionately greater decreases in
   post-treatment period abundance in control plots than in treatment plots
   (Evening Grosbeak, Steller's Jay, Warbling Vireo) or a proportionately
   lesser increase in post-treatment period abundance in the control plots
   than in treatment plots (Western WoodPewee). We conclude that
   group-selection harvesting had neutral or positive short-term effects on
   the species studied.}},

Abstract = {{The Piapiac, a little-known corvid, may be the African counterpart of
   the American jays, and its behavior supports a hypothesized link between
   conspicuous bill coloration Of juveniles and sociality of the species.
   During field observations in Cameroon, juvenile Piapiacs in mixed groups
   displayed their brightly pink bills by gaping at adults as though
   begging for food but often when no food could be obtained. They were
   more aggressive and vocal than adults against presumed enemies' and
   situations that aroused the group seemed to elicit gaping. The
   conspicuous bill coloration of juvenile Piapiacs matches their
   conspicuous behavior in mixed groups, and may act as a persisting infant
   signal, useful to block aggressive reactions by adults and facilitate
   acceptance of juveniles as helpers.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a technique to produce metal (aluminum) color bands, in
   response to concerns about leg injuries caused by celluloid-plastic
   color bands applied to Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillil). The
   technique involves color-anodized aluminum bands (unnumbered blanks and
   federal numbered bands), with auto pin-striping tape and flexible epoxy
   sealant, to create a variety of solid, half- and triple-split colors.
   This allows for hundreds of unique, high-contrast color combinations.
   During six consecutive years of application, these colored metal bands
   have resisted color fade compared to conventional celluloid-plastic
   bands, and have reduced leg injuries in the flycatcher. Although not
   necessarily warranted for all color-banding studies, these metal bands
   may provide a lower-impact option for studies of species known to be
   impacted by plastic color bands.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Many nestlings respond to alarm calls with anti-predator behavior, but
   their physiological responses to much calls are poorly understood. Alarm
   calls could stimulate increased secretion of corticosterone to mobilize
   energy reserves in anticipation of all interaction with a predator.
   However, elevated corticosterone levels can be costly to nestlings
   because they induce catabolic reactions at a time when the birds are
   engaged in anabolic processes. Thus, there may be constraints oil the
   secretion of corticosterone if the catabolic costs outweigh the
   behavioral benefits. Furthermore, many studies use baseline
   corticosterone levels as a correlate of body condition, and if nestlings
   respond hormonally when they hear abrin calls rather than when they are
   first handled by (or catch sight of) an investigator, then determination
   of baseline hormone levels would be difficult. To investigate this
   phenomenon, we broadcast taped calls of either adult conspecific alarm
   calls or songs of hererospecifics to 15-20 d old American Kestrel (Falco
   sparverius) nestlings. Playbacks were started when adults were absent,
   but adults returned and produced alarm calls at two control and three
   experimental nests. Blood was collected from randomly selected nesdings
   at each nest 13 min after the onset of a playback and within 2 min of
   opening the nest box, and the plasma was assayed for corticosterone.
   There was no difference in corcicosterone values between nestlings that
   heard alarm calls and those that heard control vocalizations. Hearing
   natural kestrel alarm calls did not affect the results, although our
   small sample sizes resulted in low power to detect differences. These
   data indicate chat 1520 d old Kestrels do not increase corticosterone
   secretion in response to adult conspecific alarm calls, and suggest chat
   studies of corticostcrone secretion in nestling kestrels will not be
   affected by the occurrence of adult alarm-calling.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the migratory bird assemblage at a high-elevation site in
   central New Mexico (Capilla Peak in the Manzano Mountains) with the bird
   assemblage at a low-elevation riparian corridor site (Rio Grande Nature
   Center State Park in Albuquerque). During fall 2001-2003, we used mist
   nets to sample these bird assemblages. We found greater species richness
   at the low-elevation site than at the high-elevation site, both overall
   and for most migratory and resident subgroups. However, at the
   high-elevation site we captured more species that may have had local
   origins at high elevations. Over the course of the study, capture rates
   were similar between sites, but there was greater annual variation in
   capture rates at the high-elevation site than at the low-elevation site.
   Several species were captured at higher rates at one site versus the
   other, and some were captured strictly at one or the other site. Our
   data showed that both sites supported many species in large numbers, and
   both riparian and montane habitats in the southwestern U.S.A. should be
   recognized for their importance as potential stopover sites for
   migrating birds.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of obtaining white blood cell (leukocyte) profiles and
   heterophil/lymphocyre (H/L) ratios from avian blood smears has become
   increasingly popular to assess immune function in wild birds. I captured
   28 House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) and made blood smears from
   samples obtained from them at 3, 30, and 60 min after capture to
   evaluate the effect of routine handling time on leukocyte profiles and
   H/L ratios. Total leukocyte Counts decreased significantly with time,
   but the proportions of each leukocyte type remained the same over the
   1-h time period. There was a nonsignificant increase in H/L ratios over
   lime, but comparison with a group of birds held for 1 h before bleeding
   Suggested that this was the result of the repeated bleedings, not
   handling time. I conclude that researchers should make every effort to
   obtain blood samples for making smears as soon as possible after
   capturing birds to ensure an accurate assessment of total leukocyte
   counts, but that routine handling times under 1 h do not affect H/L
   ratios.}},

Abstract = {{House Finches are being increasingly studied because of their variation
   in male plumage, evolving migration, and susceptibility to mycoplasmal
   conjunctiviris. Researchers traditionally use two methods for capturing
   House Finches: a walk-in hardware mesh cage around a bird feeder and
   mist nets placed next to hire feeders. However, because one method
   relies on birds' willingness to enter a foreign Structure to obtain
   food, while the other captures them while flying, these methods may not
   sample the same Subset of the House Finch population. This possibility
   could have serious consequences for studies of plumage coloration, where
   sex and age ratios are important; for studies of migration, where
   measures of wing lengths reflect migratory ability; and for studies of
   mycoplasmal infections, where disease state and measures of health are
   important. I used data from a long-term monitoring project of House
   Finches that employs both capture techniques to test if any attributes
   of House Finches differed between mist-netted and cage-trapped birds. Of
   1173 House Finch captures over 3 yr, I found no trap-related difference
   in the proportion of birds with conjunctivitis, nor in the proportions
   of males or in the ratios of molting versus non-molting birds. There was
   also no difference in House Finch tarsus lengths or weights between
   capture methods. However, a larger proportion of young birds were
   captured in cage traps, and wing lengths were greater in birds captured
   with mist nets. I conclude that in general, cage traps and mist nets
   sample similar Subsets of House Finches, but that researchers should
   view their trapping data with these inherent age and size biases in
   mind.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) have been
   declining, and agricultural practices, such as grazing by domestic
   cattle (Bos taurus), are likely contributing factors. Grazing call alter
   the composition and structure of vegetation and influence prey
   availability, and such changes can impact the nesting Success of
   grassland birds. Our objective was to examine the nesting Success of
   Grasshopper Sparrows in grazed and ungrazed habitats on the Blue Grass
   Army Depot in Madison County, Kentucky. Clutch sizes of female
   Grasshopper Sparrows nesting in grazed and ungrazed areas differed
   significantly, with mean Clutch sizes of 4.48 in ungrazed areas and 3.91
   in grazed areas. In addition, nest Success was higher in ungrazed areas
   (70\%) than grazed areas (25\%). Insect sweeps revealed that
   invertebrate biomass in ungrazed areas was greater than in grazed areas,
   and analysis of vegetation indicated that grazed areas had less litter,
   more shrubs, and shorter, less dense vegetation than ungrazed areas.
   Most unsuccessful nests were depredated, and the higher predation rates
   on nests in grazed areas may have been due to differences in vegetation
   structure. Shorter, less dense vegetation in grazed areas may make it
   easer for predators to observe adults and locate nests, while taller,
   denser vegetation ill ungrazed areas may provide greater concealment.
   While the results of previous Studies Suggest that light to moderate
   grazing call produce habitat suitable for Grasshopper Sparrows, more
   intense grazing, as on our Study area (one animal unit/ha), creates
   habitat less Suitable for these sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{We used four methods to compare the breeding chronologies of Marbled
   Murrelet at two sites at similar latitudes in British Columbia:
   Desolation Sound oil the mainland, inshore of the Strait of Georgia, and
   Clayoquot Sound oil the west coast of Vancouver Island. At both sites,
   we estimated breeding chronologies from the timing of (1) nest
   initiation dates determined by radio-telemetry, (2) the chick feeding
   period determined from observations of fish-holding adults, (3) hatch
   dates determined from observations of juveniles on the water, and (4)
   brood patch scores determined from captured birds. At Desolation Sound,
   these methods each produced a similar distribution of nesting dates, but
   at Clayoquot Sound, the distribution of nesting dates of radio-tracked
   birds were substantially biased towards later nests. Despite these
   methodological difficulties, we found that Marbled Murrelets at
   Desolation Sound bred ca. 30 d later than at Clayoqout Sound. Regional
   differences in breeding chronology of this magnitude, if not property
   calibrated, would bias estimates of peak inland activity, and Should be
   considered in forestry operations, the interpretation of census data,
   and the design of monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty-six Dunlins (Calidris alpina) that died accidentally at banding
   sites in Buck Bay (southern Baltic Sea), Poland, between 1998-2001 were
   sexed by dissection and measured. Measurements and sexes of these 32
   females and 24 males were used to derive a discriminate function to help
   predict sexes of the C. a. alpina race using phenotypic measurements
   (bill, tarsus, and wing). Another sample of 16 female and 19 male
   Dunlins was used to validate this function. The best discriminate
   function for predicting the sex of juvenile Dunlins in the Southern
   Baltic included bill, tarsus, and wing length. Among single
   measurements, wing length was the poorest predictor of sex. Bill length
   was the best indicator, correctly identifying 91 \% of juvenile Dunlins
   in the validation sample. Longer-billed females were more likely to be
   mis-classified than shorter-billed males. The bills of juvenile Dunlins
   migrating through the Southern Baltic region in the autumn are still
   growing, and it appears as if these long-billed juvenile female dunlins
   rake more time to reach their final bill size than males.}},

Abstract = {{Poor reproductive Success has contributed to the decline and low
   population size of the federally listed Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius
   alexandrinus nivosus), especially where it breeds on coastal beaches
   used by humans for recreation. Front 2001-2004, we compared reproductive
   Success of color-marked plovers breeding oil ocean beaches with chose on
   gravel bars of the lower Eel River in coastal northern California, one
   of six recovery units as identified by the species' recovery plan. In
   three of four years, more plovers (54-64\%) nested in river than beach
   habitats, but this pattern was reversed in the last year of the Study
   when 62\% of plovers used beaches. Each year, a higher proportion Of
   Clutches hatched and more chicks fledged from river than beach habitats,
   producing a disproportionate number of yearlings recruited into the
   local population From the river. On average, river-liesting males rended
   significantly fewer eggs, hatched similar numbers of chicks, and fledged
   significantly more young compared with males breeding oil beaches.
   Corvids were more prevalent in river habitats in two of four years, but
   beaches consistently had significantly greater human activity. These
   habitat differences in reproductive Success exist despite efforts to
   manage predators (e.g., exclosures around nests) and humans (e.g.,
   signs, Fencing, and vehicle restrictions) on beaches and almost no
   management of river habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 yr Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus) populations have
   declined in California. We monitored Warbling Vireo nests in the high
   elevations of the northern Sierra Nevada in the Tahoe National Forest
   near Truckee, California. Nest survivorship was low (29.9\% Mayfield
   estimate) compared to Warbling Vireo populations outside of California,
   but Similar to levels reported for other California populations.
   Brown-headed Cowbird (Molotbrus titer) parasitism in the study
   population was low (7\%). Warbling Vireo nest fare was related to
   nest-site location; successful nests in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
   were situated on the west or ``warmer{''} side of the tree, in the outer
   periphery of the foliage, and in areas with slightly less canopy cover
   compared to unsuccessful nests. These features of the nest site may help
   reduce the threat of predation and combat cold stress. Our results argue
   that Warbling Vireos in the northern Sierra Nevada have low nest
   survivorship (similar to populations in other areas of the state), and
   that successful nests ire often found on thin branches well removed from
   the main stem.}},

   a stimulus in the nest entrance is presented. However, predation risk

   and Great Tit (Parus major) nestlings to an artificial stimulus
   imitating a predator was examined. Sightless nestlings begged to the
   stimulus, but older nestlings did not. Developmental improvement of the

Abstract = {{Long-term pair bonds and defense of territories year-round are common
   among tropical passerines. The boundaries of these territories tend to
   be stable, perhaps reflecting the need to defend an area that,
   regardless of conditions, provides sufficient food resources. If,
   however, these stable territories are not, even temporarily,
   sufficiently large, then intra-pair competition for available food may
   result, particularly in species with no sexual size dimorphism. With
   such competition, sex-specific differences in foraging behavior may
   result. Male and female Dusky Antbirds (Cercomacra tyrannina) are not
   size dimorphic, and pairs jointly defend territories throughout the
   year. Our objective was to determine if paired Dusky Antbirds exhibited
   sex-specific differences in foraging behavior. Foraging antbirds were
   observed in central Panama from February-July 2002 to determine if pairs
   partitioned food resources. Males and females exhibited no differences
   in Foraging behavior, with individuals of both sexes foraging at similar
   heights and using the same foraging maneuvers (glean, probe, and sally)
   and substrates (leaves, rolled leaves, and woody surfaces). These
   results suggest that Dusky Antbirds do not partition resources and that
   territory switching, rather than resource partitioning, may be the means
   by which they gain access to additional food resources.}},

Abstract = {{The nests of altricial bind species are host to a variety of nest
   ectoparasites that may develop high infestation levels and have a
   negative impact oil chick growth, hematocrit, metabolic capacity, and
   survival before or after fledging. IF ecroparasites affect chick
   development and fitness, then one Would expect chicks to express
   behavior that might serve to limit the impact of parasites. We compared
   the behavior of nestling Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) in nests with and
   without ecroparasitic blowfly larvae (Protocalliphora spp.). In
   parasitized nests, Only 14.5\% of the 15-s sampling periods were devoted
   to rest, whereas all chicks were testing in 32.5\% of sampling periods
   for unparasitized nests. When nests were classed as active,
   repositioning Occurred nearly twice as often ill parasitized nests
   (83.5\%) as in unparasitized ones (48.5\%). Comfort behavior (e.g.,
   preening) Occurred more frequently in unparasitized nests (35.1\%) than
   in parasitized (18.1\%). The proportion of time spent repositioning
   increased linearly with parasite load. The daily energy expenditure of
   parasitized nestlings (2.3 kJ/g/d) did nor differ significantly from
   that of Unparasitized nestlings (3.1 kJ/g/d), and the tendency was
   towards lower energy expenditure ill parasitized chicks. We cannot rule
   out the EAU chat Our anti-parasite treatment increased the
   thermoregulatory costs of unparasitized chicks and obscured the
   energetic costs of parasites. However, We argue that Proto-calliphora
   also call cause a depression in nestling body temperature that reduces
   metabolic rare, thus offsetting the costs of increased activity, while
   also reducing tissue growth races.}},

Abstract = {{The Chestnut-capped Blackbird (Agelaius ruficapillus) is widely
   distributed in South America. where it breeds in a variety of natural
   and man-made habitats. We studied the nesting of this species during two
   breeding se;seasons in rice paddies of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, a
   region where it is considered a pest on rice crops. Chestnut-capped
   Blackbirds build nests in rice paddies when the plants start to flower;
   thus, breeding phenology in this habitat is determined by sowing date.
   Clutch size averaged 2.5 eggs, and We found chat Clutch size tends to
   decrease the farther the nests are from the Surface of the water.
   Incubation lasted 12.9 d on average, and hatching was asynchronous, The
   duration of the nestling period ranged from 12 to 17 d with an average
   of 13.9 days. Only 7.1\% of nests were preyed upon, and none was
   parasitized by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis). About 90\% of
   nests produced at least one fledgling. These results Suggest that the
   growth of the Chestnut-capped Blackbird Population in Rio Grande do Sul
   may be due not only to the high availability of food during the
   nonbreeding season but also to the bird's relatives high breeding
   success in rice paddies.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term, volunteer-based nest-box program for American Kestrels
   (Falco sparverius) breeding in eastern Pennsylvania was evaluated to
   identify ways to increase the efficiency of the program and to identify
   general principles that can be used to improve long-term conservation
   efforts for other nest-box programs. Between 1993 and 2002, Hawk
   Mountain Sanctuary volunteers maintained and monitored approximately 270
   kestrel nest boxes. Reproductive parameters of kestrels in these nest
   boxes were similar to those reported in other studies, and kestrels
   attempted nesting twice in a single year on I I occasions. Nesting
   success varied among nest boxes, and productivity was consistently high
   at some nest boxes and consistently low at others. As a result,
   approximately half of all nestlings came from the 25\% of nest boxes
   that were used most frequently, and fewer than 7\% of kestrels fledged
   front the 25\% of the nest boxes that were Lased least frequently. Our
   analysis suggests that volunteer field effort could be reduced by 25\%
   with minimal impact on overall kestrel productivity. Managing for
   increased conservation efficiency is not inconsistent with effective
   conservation monitoring and management of kestrels. Our findings have
   important implications for conservation efforts in which substantial
   benefits can accrue from more efficient use of limited conservation
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate measures of reproductive performance in birds are vital to
   effective conservation and management Of Populations. We evaluate the
   effectiveness of a recently proposed method to estimate reproductive
   performance based upon behavior of breeding birds during responses to
   Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mobbing calls. We examined
   whether responses of Black-throared Blue Warblers (Dendroica
   caerulescens) to mobbing calls were related to measures of reproductive
   performance as determined in a nest monitoring study. We found that
   individuals that were successful reproducers were more likely to exhibit
   a response to the mobbing calls. Successfully reproducing individuals
   were more likely to display evidence of reproductive success (e.g.,
   carrying nesting material, carrying food) when they responded to the
   mobbing call. Observations of reproductive success, however, depended on
   the distance of the observation to the nest site of the individual. We
   conclude that responses to mobbing calls have limited utility For
   discerning variability in reproductive success among territories.
   However, if the research objective is to obtain coarse comparative
   estimates of reproductive success at large spatial scales over which
   reproductive output is likely to be highly variable, then observations
   generated by the mobbing playback method may suffice.}},

Abstract = {{The Rufous Hornero, (Furnarius rufus: Family Furnariidae), common in
   southern Brazil, is a territorial, sexually monomorphic bird in which
   pairs sing duets. This family of birds is known for its lack of sexual
   dimorphism and for the simplicity of its song types. Here I report that
   each sex consistently sings a distinct song during the duet: the song
   starts with both sexes singing identically, followed by a divergence of
   the female, who slows her singing rate. Also, since both birds pump
   their wings while singing, at the same frequency as their singing, it
   possible to see which bird sings at which rate. Sexually dimorphic songs
   have been observed in other bird species, and Suggested in other species
   in the Family Furnariidae, but this is the first report in which the
   nature of the song difference is clearly documented. I suggest that
   many, or all, territorial and sexually monomorphic species of furnariids
   (and other families, especially suboscines) show similar, consistent
   sexual differences in song types.}},

Abstract = {{Many Studies have reported variation in bird diet composition related to
   spatial variation in habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity. Most
   diet analyses involve collection of food items at a sub-sample of
   available sites. Because individuals at different sites may vary ill
   their diet composition, the description of the diet of a population may
   depend oil which sites are sampled. This potential bias associated with
   environmental heterogeneity has never been explicitly tested. We used
   dietary data from a long-term study of an owl population to Simulate
   various scenarios of diet assessment in which the investigator samples
   food items from various sites without taking into account their
   variation in quality. The simulations showed that assessment of diet
   composition was highly dependent or, the lumber and type of sites
   sampled for food items and that such bias caused by environmental
   heterogeneity disappeared when food samples were randomly collected at
   more than 60\% of the available sires. Biases in diet description may
   affect a large number of studies, especially of territorial species in
   heterogeneous landscapes. Similar biases may apply to the assessment of
   demographic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In many birds, it is assumed chat conditions for breeding follow a
   seasonal pattern of improvement and then decline and that for each
   individual in the population the optimal clutch size is larger when
   conditions for breeding are more favorable. While this is assumed to be
   the case for single-brooded species, the situation is more complex for
   multi-brooded species, which start breeding before the date when their
   optimal clutch size is greatest and conditions are best for raising
   nestlings. The seasonal patterns of productivity for multi-brooded
   species are not generally understood. We compared the clutch size, egg
   size and weight, and the nesting success of Meadow Pipits (Anthus
   pratensis) nesting during the early and late stages of the breeding
   season in Scotland. We also compared the provisioning rates, diet, and
   number of prey items fed to nestlings. Eggs laid late in the season were
   significantly larger and heavier than eggs laid earlier in the season.
   There were generally no differences in diet or provisioning rates of
   nestlings thronghout the season. Despite producing larger eggs late in
   the season, the probability of such an egg producing a nestling that
   Successfully fledged was 17\% lower than an egg laid early in the
   season. This was mainly due to a significant increase in nest predation
   late in the season.}},

Abstract = {{Nest predation was the main nest mortality factor for Spotted Towhees
   (Pipilo ntacuZattis) along the Sacramento River, California, during
   1993-2003, followed by cowbird parasitism. From 2001 to 2003, 1
   monitored 161 Spotted Towhee nests and filmed 24 nests using miniature
   infrared video cameras to identify predators. Daily survival rate was
   0.928 for this period. I detected no difference in nest survival between
   the incubation and nestling stages. Nests with cameras had marginally
   higher survival rates than those without. I filmed nine nest predation
   events in 2002 and 2003. Eight of these were upon nestlings, while one
   was upon eggs. Predators were birds, mammals, and a snake, including the
   Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo linearus), Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus
   ater), Western Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma californica), a raccoon (Procyon
   lotor), black or Norway rats (Rattus sp.), two unidentified rodents, and
   a racer (Coluber constrictor). Many of these predators are associated
   with agriculture and/or human habitation. I documented two
   multi-predator events. In both instances,a diurnal partial predation by
   a bird was followed by a nocturnal rodent predator. Two predation events
   occurred at the very end of the nestling period. I advise investigators
   engaged in nest success studies to consider the possibility of partial
   predation that may reduce a female's overall reproductive Output and
   note that a nest should only be considered successful when direct
   evidence of fledglings is observed near the nest. I recommend more
   detailed studies of nest predator composition and the compound effects
   of Brown-headed Cowbird nest parasitism and ``infanticide.{''}}},

Abstract = {{We radio-tracked eight female Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) prior
   to egg-laying in 2000 and 2001. Six females made movements > 2 kin to

   nearest available roost site, they used different roosts on different
   nights, and during the day they foraged Lip to 10 kin from their nest
   site. Thus, female swallows move over a large area (103 km(2)) prior to
   egg-laying. These widespread movements appear to be unusual among
   swallows, and they may allow females to survey a large number of

Abstract = {{Bacillus licbeniformis, a soil bacterium capable of degrading the
   beta-keratin in feathers, is present in the plumage of some wild-caught
   birds, but the published carriage rate is quite low. Microbial
   degradation could be a selective agent leading to the evolution of molt
   and Plumage pigmentation, but we hypothesized that for B. licheniformis
   to have played an important role in avian evolution, it is likely to
   occur more widely in bird populations than previously reported. We
   sampled the plumage of 461 wild-caught birds of eight species. We
   designed a selective and differential culture method to isolate bacteria
   with the potential to degrade feathers. putative feather-degrading
   bacteria were isolated from 21-59\% of the individuals of each of the
   species tested, for an average carriage rate of 39\%. 16S rRNA (rrnA)
   sequencing of 98 of these bacterial isolates indicated that 69\% were
   Bacillus lichenformis, suggesting that the prevalence of this
   feather-clegrading bacterium is 4 X higher than previously reported. We
   also hypothesized that interspecific variation in avian plumage,
   behavior, and habitat may have led to the evolution of host-specific B.
   licheniformis strains. Fingerprinting of B. licheniformis isolated from
   Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) and Gray Catbirds (Dumetella
   carolinensis) using REP-PCR demonstrated that for nine owls, one
   individual carried four different strains and eight individuals carried
   only one strain. Of 20 carbirds, there was a single strain found on nine
   birds, but four carried two different strains each.}},

Abstract = {{We used traditional searching, as well as radio-telementry, to find 125
   Wood Thrush (Hylbcichla mustelina) nests during 1994-1996 at the
   Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia, USA. We compared daily
   nest survival rates for 66 nests of radio-marked birds with 59 nests of
   birds found through systematic searching. By using radio-telemetry, we
   found Wood Thrush nests in higher elevation pine habitats, in addition
   to the more usual hardwood forests with moist soils. We found nests of
   radio-marked birds farther from streams than nests found by systematic
   searching. Thirty-two percent of radio-marked birds' nests were found at
   the tops of slopes, compared to 15\% of the nests found by traditional
   searching. In addition, radio-marked birds generally moved upslope for
   re-nesting attempts. Although the distribution of nests found with
   telemetry and searching varied, daily nest survival did not vary between
   the two groups. Radio-telemetry provided new information about Wood
   Thrush nesting habitats. We believe radio-telemetry can be a valuable
   addition to traditional searching techniques; it has the potential to
   provide a sample of nests free from a priori habitat biases.}},

Abstract = {{Most work on the effects of land-cover change on tropical birds has
   focused on forest-interior birds because these species are assumed to be
   the most severely affected by forest loss. However, even species that
   use human-altered habitat types may be severely affected by forest loss.
   White-throated Robins (Turdus assimilis) frequently nest in coffee and
   pasture in southern Costa Rica, although several lines of evidence
   suggest the species could not exist solely in agricultural habitat. We
   used radio-telemetry to examine the area and proportion of different
   habitat types used by adult White-throated Robins. Mean area of use for
   the tracking period was 0.26 km(2) and varied from 0.07 to 0.58 km(2).
   No robins had areas of use solely in either primary forest or
   agricultural cover, although individuals were initially captured in both
   primary forest and a coffee plantation. All areas of use contained some
   forest, pasture, and coffee or regenerating forest. The mean percentages
   of the habitat types used by the birds were fairly equal with 30\%
   forest, 33\% pasture, and 38\% coffee or regenerating forest. Our
   results, combined with other evidence, indicate that the White-throated
   Robin uses multiple habitat types but that it may require some threshold
   level of forest to sustain viable populations.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection theory, proposes that elaborate male secondary, sexual
   characteristics, including complex song, may increase the attractiveness
   of males by, honestly communicating to females their genetic quality or
   ability to provide material reproductive resources such as parental
   care. The Gray Catbird (Dunietella carolinojsis) is sexually
   monochromatic, but males sing complex songs during the breeding season
   while females do not. We tested the hypotheses that song-phrase
   versatility, and rate of song-phrase production are honest indicators of
   male parental effort. We predicted that both song-phrase versatility and
   rate of production would be positively, correlated with Paternal chick
   feeding rate. Paternal chick feeding rate was not significantly related
   to song-phrase versatility, but it was positively and significantly
   correlated with song-phrase production rate. Thus, song-phrase
   production rate may, serve as a more reliable indicator of male parental
   quality, than song versatility, in the Gray, Catbird.}},

Abstract = {{Time-lapse video photography has become a valuable tool for collecting
   data on avian nest activity and depredition; however, commercially
   available systems are expensive (> USA \$4000/unit). We designed an
   inexpensive system to identify causes of nest failure of American
   Oystercatchers (Haenzatopus palliatus) and assessed its utility at
   Cumberland Island National Seashore, Georgia. We Successfully identified
   raccoon (Procyon lotor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American Crow (Corvus
   brachyrhynchos), and ghost crab (Orypode quadrata) predation on
   oystercatcher nests. Other detected causes of nest failure included
   tidal overwash, horse trampling, abandonment, and human destruction.
   System failure races were comparable with commercially available units.
   Our system's efficacy and low cost (<\$800) provided useful data for the
   management and conservation of the American Oystercatcher.}},

Abstract = {{In birds, males and females may benefit by choosing mates based on
   morphological characteristics correlated with their ability to provide
   parental care. Our objective was to examine possible relationships
   between morphological characteristics and the provisioning behavior of
   male and female Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens). No differences
   were found in the provisioning behavior of male and female
   Yellow-breasted Chats. Adult chats provisioned nestlings at higher rates
   and delivered more biomass at first nests than during later nesting
   attempts. This indicates that, later in the breeding season, nestling
   chats may require less energy, perhaps because warmer temperatures lower
   thermoregulatory costs. No correlations, either positive or negative,
   between chat morphological characteristics (mass, eye stripe length,
   tail length, wing chord, tarsus length, and plumage color) and
   provisioning behavior were noted. Thus, these results do not provide
   support for either the honest advertisement hypothesis (that predicts a
   positive relationship between quality and parental care) or the
   differential allocation hypothesis (that predicts a negative
   relationship). If mare choice among chats is based on future parental
   care, the absence of such correlations Suggests that characteristics
   other than those examined in this study may be used by chats.
   Alternatively, chats may not base mate choice decisions on future
   parental care, but rather on other features such as territory quality.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the relationship between migratory restlessness and
   stored energy reserves in two species of landbird migrants at Braddock
   Bay, Lake Ontario during spring 1999 and spring 2000. There was no
   significant difference in the amount of nighttime locomotor activity
   between lean and Fat Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) or
   While-chroated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) held overnight in
   activity cages. We found no significant relationships between nocturnal
   activity level and energetic condition (mass/wing chord) or date of
   capture. In addition, there were no significant differences in nocturnal
   activity, levels between age groups in Swainson's Thrushes. These
   results suggest that the migratory restlessness of spring migrants
   stopping at this sire is not strongly influenced by their energetic
   condition upon arrival, regardless of age or date of passage. Birds
   nearing the end of their spring migratory route that are very close to
   their breeding grounds may show decreased levels of migratory
   restlessness and short stopover durations, independent of energy
   reserves. When stopping at northerly sites, spring migrants may
   therefore display distinct differences in stopover behavior and
   requirements compared to sites used earlier along the spring migratory
   route.}},

Abstract = {{Movement ecology and demographic parameters for the Common Merganser
   (Mergus merganser americanus) in North America are poorly known. We used
   band-recovery data from five locations across North America spanning the
   years 1938-1998 to examine migratory patterns and estimate survival
   rates. We examined competing time-invariant, age-graduated models with
   program MARK to Study sources of variation in survival and reporting
   probability We considered age, sex, geographic location, and the use of
   nasal saddles on hatching year birds at one location as possible Sources
   of variation. Year-of-banding was included as a covariate in a post-hoc
   analysis. We found that migratory tendency, defined as the average
   distance between banding and recovery locations, varied geographically.
   Similarly, all models accounting for the majority of variation in
   recovery and Survival probabilities included location of banding. Models
   that included age and sex received less Support, but we lacked
   sufficient data to adequately assess these parameters. Model-averaged
   estimates of annual survival ranged from 0.21 in Michigan to 0.82 in
   Oklahoma. Heterogeneity in migration tendency and survival suggests that
   demographic patterns may vary across geographic scales, with
   implications for the population dynamics of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Seaside Sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus) nest at varying population
   densities, and breeding pairs may occupy either large, all-purpose
   activity spaces or small nesting territories, foraging in undefended
   areas separate from the nest site. We determined the prevalence of
   extra-pair paternity in a large, socially monogamous population of
   Seaside Sparrows nesting in small, overlapping territories. We used six
   microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based approach to paternity
   assignment. Five of 47 chicks (11\%) in three of 18 broods (17\%) in
   this population were sired by extra-pair males. Although this is the
   first study of the genetic mating system in the genus Ammodramus, the
   rate of extra-pair paternity we observed is lower than in most other New
   World emberizines. As the first measurment of extra-pair paternity in
   Seaside Sparrows, this study provides a baseline for comparative studies
   of how extra-pair paternity is influenced by the wide variation in
   nesting density and territoriality Found in Seaside Sparrows. These
   results, from a socially monogamous sparrow may also provide a context
   for studies of unusual mating systems in other salt-marsh nesting birds.}},

Abstract = {{Birds killed by colliding with towers and windows were studied to
   describe the type and extent of injuries and, more precisely, to Suggest
   the actual cause of death. A total of 502 specimens (247 tower kills,
   255 window kills) were dissected, radiographed, and examined. Tower and
   window collision categories were further Subdivided to consider age
   (subadult versus adult) and weight (< 39 g, sparrow-size or smaller,
   versus > 39 g, cardinal size or larger) differences in injury and
   differential vulnerabiliry Injuries were classified as superficial,
   subdermal, or skeletal fractures. Comparisons of injuries between tower-
   and window-killed specimens indicate that the consequences of these two
   types of collisions are similar. Subdermal injuries were more severe in
   tower kills than in window kills. Subadults experienced more severe
   subdermal injuries than adult tower and window casualties. Among window
   kills, larger birds had more severe subdernial injuries than smaller
   birds. Collision victims may show blood or fluid in the mouth or nose
   cavities (30-60\%), almost all have subdernial intracranial hemorrhaging
   (98-99\%), and most lack any evidence of skeletal fractures (82-91\%).
   Histological examination of the brain of two specimens revealed blood
   pools in the cerebrum and cerebellum. The extravascular bleeding in and
   around the brain is probably the actual cause of death in collision
   fatalities. Treatment to reduce brain edema if administered within 6-8 h
   shortly after impact can save some strike casualties.}},

Abstract = {{Anting is a widespread but poorly understood behavior in which birds

   observed two instances of active anting in the `Elepaio (Chasiempis

   one involving a garlic snail (Oxychilus alliarius) and the second
   involving a fruit of Brazilian pepper or Christmas berry (Schinus
   terebinthifolius). On both occasions the `Elepaio held the object in its
   bill and wiped it on its body then preened, but did not eat the object.
   Chemical compounds contained in each species are known to have
   antibiotic properties, Suggesting the purpose of the anting was to
   control parasites or pathogens. There are no native ants in Hawaii, and
   neither the garlic snail nor Brazilian pepper is native to Hawaii.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) arc declining,
   and loss of habitat is a likely factor. Coal mine reclamation has
   created grassland habitat in Kentucky and elsewhere, and information is
   needed concerning the use of these areas by Henslow's Sparrows. We
   compared the behavior and ecology of Populations on reclaimed sites and
   non-mined sites in west-central Kentucky during the 2000 and 2001
   breeding seasons. Territories were smaller on the reclaimed sites than
   unmined sites, perhaps due to differences in habitat quality. Insect
   sweeps revealed more prey biomass on reclaimed sites than unmined sites.
   Twenty-eight of 48 nests (58\%) fledged at least one Young, and nesting
   success was similar on reclaimed and unmined sites. Mean clutch size was
   3.75, with no difference between reclaimed and unmined sites. Similarly,
   the mean number of fledglings per nest was similar on reclaimed and
   unmined sites. multivariate analysis revealed differences in the
   characteristics of vegetation on reclaimed areas and unmined areas.
   Reclaimed areas had more grass cover and greater vegetation density,
   probably due to differences in management history (i.e., mowing or
   burning) and species composition. Our results indicate that the nesting
   success of Henslow's Sparrows on reclaimed surface mines in Kentucky is
   comparable to that on unmined areas. As such, the thousand of hectares
   of reclaimed surface mines in Kentucky and elsewhere Could play an
   important role in stabilizing populations of Henslow's Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation strategies for Neotropical migratory birds have emphasized
   identification and preservation of habitats in which Populations are
   reproducing above replacement rates. In 2000-2001, we monitored 141
   Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) nests in the extensively
   forested Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia to assess the site's potential
   to host ``Source{''} Populations of this common species. Our estimates
   of reproductive Success, unlike most Studies, incorporated the nesting
   behavior of marked females followed throughout the breeding season.
   Despite the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in a
   nearby 15-y-old clearcut and in open areas of a Summer camp, We found no
   parasitized nests. Overall, the predation rate was 41\%, 2.5 Hedglings
   were produced per successful nesting attempt, and seasonal fecundity
   approached two female fledglings per adult female per season. Given
   return rates (minimum survival rates) of 52\% at our study site, our
   measured levels of reproductive Success are sufficient to classify the
   Blue Ridge Mountains as a potential ``Source{''} for Acadian
   Flycatchers. Our data contrast sharply with those collected from
   landscapes with high levels of forest fragmentation in the midwestern
   and southeastern U.S., where even relatively large patches of forest
   appear to host ``sink{''} populations of Acadian Flycatchers.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of many of Mexico's wetlands for waterbirds remains
   poorly assessed, and this is all obstacle in planning their
   conservation. Between Marismas Nacionales, Nayarit, and the center of
   the state of Guerrero, a span of roughly 1150 km on the Pacific coast of
   Mexico, there is only large coastal wetland: Laguna de Cuyutlan and its
   associated wetlands in the state of Colima. We Studied the waterbirds
   that used this area during the non-breeding season, from September 1996
   to March 1997. We Surveyed birds on eight occasions from 11 Stations
   that included different combinations of mudflats, water pools, shallow
   water, deep water, and mangroves. Throughout the study we counted 54,370
   individuals of 57 species of waterbirds, but 11 species accounted for
   90\% of all individuals. The total number of individuals exhibited
   strong seasonal variation, although peaks in abundance reflected
   variations of only a few species. Waterbirds differed greatly in their
   use of different sires. The site with the most individuals, but not with
   the most species, had a combination of mudflats, shallow water, and
   deeper water. The poorest sites where those associated with a
   thermoelectric facility. We cannot extrapolate our numbers to the entire
   wetland complex, but the overall numbers of waterbirds suggest that the
   area be considered all Area de Importancia para la Conservacion de las
   Aves. The two economic activities in Cuyutlan, fishing and salt
   production, do not seem to pose direct threats to waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Although nocturnal habitats are often critical to avian survival, they
   are relatively unstudied. Nocturnal roost habitat selection may be
   particularly important for Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) broods, which
   experience high mortality due to predation and exposure in the first few
   weeks after hatching. Because these habitats may have important
   consequences for Ruffed Grouse productivity and abundance, and little is
   known about them, we assessed nocturnal roost habitat selection of
   Ruffed Grouse broods and the influence of habitat features on brood
   survival in central Pennsylvania. Roost use changed through time, with
   grouse broods roosting on the ground in the first five weeks after
   hatching and arboreally thereafter. Broods selected roost sites with
   greater deciduous canopy cover, coarser woody debris, and more
   concealing cover than at random sites. Habitat did nor differ between
   ground and arboreal roosts. Brood survival declined from a mean 0.90 in
   the first week to 0.38 through the fifth week and was negatively
   affected by increasing stem density. Roost use is likely determined by
   developmental constraints on the thermoregulatory ability of chicks,
   while habitat selection reflects a compromise between diurnal habitat
   needs and behavioral adaptations that reduce exposure to nocturnal
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the frequency of brood amalgamation in the Northern
   Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is largely anecdotal. Information on it
   is important in understanding survival and reproduction. We captured
   entire bobwhite broods at 3-4 and 10-12 d of age and individually marked
   each bobwhite chick within a brood. Broods were considered amalgamated
   if novel unmarked or marked individuals or significant differences in
   body mass or flight ability among chicks were observed. During 2002,
   minimum frequencies of brood amalgamation within bobwhite broods were
   6.7\% at 3-4 d and 20.7\% for 10-12 d-old broods. During 2003, minimum
   frequencies of brood amalgamation ranged from 0.0\% at 3-4 to 22.2\% for
   10-12 d-old broods. Our results indicate bobwhites exhibit higher rates
   and earlier onset of brood amalgamation than previously documented among
   the Galliformes. Causes of brood amalgamation in bobwhite may differ
   from those proposed for waterfowl due to the bobwhite's limited
   mobility, short lifespan, gregarious behavior, and resulting potential
   for relatedness among individuals. Molecular techniques should be used
   to assess the effects of inclusive fitness losses and gains among
   bobwhites that donate and receive chicks. Bobwhite researchers should
   recognize the potential bias in chick survival estimates caused by high
   rates of brood amalgamation.}},

Abstract = {{Dusky Flycatchers (Empidonax oberholseri) nesting in a mixed
   conifer-aspen woodland in southern Utah occurred at a breeding density
   of 0.44 territories/ba. Females began laying first clutches 1-26 June;
   adults fed nestlings (in renesting attempts) as late as mid August. Mean
   clutch size was 3.8 eggs in first clutches and 3.6 eggs overall.
   Incubating females spent 90\% of daylight hours on the nest, where they
   were fed by males 1.1 times/hour. Incubation lasted 14-16 d; nestlings
   remained in the nest 15-17 d. Thirteen of 32 nests (40.6\%) were
   successful in producing at least one fledgling, with successful nests
   producing 2.7 young/nest. Based on exposure, probability of a nest
   Surviving from egg laying to fledging was 0.40. Predation accounted for
   84.2\% of nest Failures; brood parasitism by a Brown-headed Cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) occurred at one nest.}},

Abstract = {{Using data on the extent of prebasic molt in known-aged adult and
   first-winter Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), we assessed the
   accuracy of the molt limit as a tool for ageing birds. Sixty-nine
   known-aged birds were examined over the winter 2002-2003 in tipper
   Carmel Valley, California. We also examined 29 breeding males in spring
   2004 to assess the accuracy of this method for ageing birds during the
   breeding season. All birds were aged correctly using molt limit as the
   defining characteristic. We found that all first-winter birds had
   replaced 2-8 greater secondary coverts, while adults had replaced all
   wing coverts. We observed no significant sexual variation in the extent
   of first prebasic molt. These results indicate chat the extent of
   prebasic molt is a highly reliable means of ageing birds in this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the gonadal and molt cycle of three species of Columbina
   ground-doves in seasonal savannas of Venezuela to explore whether
   gonadal development is related to seasonal patterns of rainfall. The
   study site is a strongly seasonal, open woodland-savanna displaying a
   predictable alternation of dry and wet seasons, providing strong cues on
   environmental periodicity and on the variation in the level of food
   resources associated with those fluctuations. All three species of doves
   had an extensive breeding season, bred (although not exclusively) during
   the dry season, had fully functional testes independent of rainfall, and
   displayed a relatively small seasonal fluctuation in testes size.
   Nevertheless, even though all three species were exposed to similar
   ambient conditions and their diets overlapped extensively, there were
   noticeable differences in their testicular cycles, and no simple
   generalizations regarding the possible stimulatory roles of photoperiod
   or rainfall were apparent. The testes of most Scaled Doves (C squammata)
   remained fully or partly recrudesced throughout the year, but a
   significant reduction in testes size occurred in May, at the beginning
   of the rainy season, when the size of the soil seed bank should be
   smallest. Maximum testes sizes were reached from November through March
   during the beginning and peak of the dry season, when the seed bank is
   expected to be large. In this species, neither rainfall nor longer
   photoperiod had a stimulatory effect on testicular development. Ruddy
   Ground-Doves (C talpacoti) had an extensive, and seemingly double,
   breeding season encompassing the latter part of the dry season and the
   rainy season. Male C talpacoti had fully functional testes in the peak
   of the dry season, some three months ahead of the first rains. Hence, as
   in the Scaled Dove, the influence of rainfall on testicular development
   was not apparent, but testicular recrudescence coincided with the period
   of increasing day length and we cannot rule out a possible degree of
   photo responsiveness in Ruddy Ground-Doves. Males of Plain-breasted
   Ground-Doves (C minuta) underwent testicular regression in April and
   May, at the beginning of the rainy period, and testicular recrudescence
   progressed along with the advancement of the rainy season. In this
   species, rainfall, but not increasing photoperiod, could have a
   stimulatory effect on gonadal development, since testes became smaller
   as day length increased towards May, but testis size increased until
   November while days were becoming shorter. In none of the species was
   the molt of primary wing feathers synchronous, but in all of them there
   was a tendency not to molt primaries during the peak of the rainy
   season. At the level of the population, the periods of breeding and wing
   molt overlapped. The molt was spread over most of the year in all
   species. An unforeseen finding was a highly biased sex ratio in favor of
   males among adults in all species.}},

Abstract = {{We used original data (mist net captures) from San Salvador and Andros
   Island and literature sources for 19 islands in the Bahamas to conduct a
   biogeographic analysis of the permanent resident, terrestrial bird
   communities in the archipelago. The number of regularly occurring
   resident species on the 19 islands varied between 6 and 35 species.
   Island area accounted for 76\% of the variation in richness, but
   multivariate analyses showed that vegetation and topography also
   affected richness: the richest communities were found on large islands
   that were dominated by pines and which had the highest topographic
   relief. Separate analyses of raptors, pigeons and doves,
   near-passerines, and passerines confirmed the primacy of island area as
   a determinant of richness among all groups except passerines. Among the
   latter species, area effects were secondary to vegetation type and
   elevation. The number of bird species on San Salvador conformed closely
   to the number predicted based on island area alone, but habitat use by
   the current avian community is at odds with the taller broadleaf forests
   that covered most of the island little more than 300 yr ago. We suspect
   that San Salvador has experienced numerous extinctions since that time.}},

Abstract = {{Locating and monitoring nests are among the most widely used approaches
   in studies of avian ecology, evolution, and conservation. While several
   papers outline ``best practices{''} for nest studies, nest-searching
   techniques are seldom standardized in field investigations because
   observers generally use strategies that work best for them. In this
   study, I examined if field observers differed in the cues they used to
   locate nests, the species they found, and the fate of their nests (i.e.,
   successful or failed), and the extent to which nest-searching cues were
   associated with either nest fate or vegetation characteristics
   surrounding the nest. My field assistants and I monitored 355 songbird
   nests on 10 forested sites in central Pennsylvania in 1998-99. Parental
   behavior was the most frequently used cue for locating nests (41\%),
   followed by systematic searching of nesting substrate (37\%). Accidental
   flushing of the parent (5\%) and luck (17\%) were involved in fewer
   located nests. Field observers differed in the cues they used to find
   nests, and these nest-searching cues were associated with finding
   certain species. In addition, estimates of nesting success (percentage
   of nests fledging young) differed among field observers by up to 2.35X.
   Nest-searching cues were related to nest-placement (e.g., nest height)
   and vegetation characteristics (e.g., leaf litter) within nest-patches
   for Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus),
   and Scarlet Tanagers (Piranga olivacea), although cues were not
   significantly related to the fate of nests. Overall, nest-searching cues
   were associated with nest placement, nest-patch habitat, and species
   composition of nest samples, all of which can ultimately influence
   findings from nesting studies. Consequently, investigators should
   exercise caution when allocating individual effort across experimental
   units and consider assigning each observer to greater than or equal to1
   treatment, multiple observers to each site, and addressing nest-patch
   and nest-placement differences among cues through training and data
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting success of Dusky Canada Geese (Branta canadensis occidentalis)
   has declined greatly since a major earthquake affected southern Alaska
   in 1964. To identify nest predators, we collected predation data at
   goose nests and photographs of predators at natural nests containing
   artificial eggs in 1997-2000. To document feeding behavior by nest
   predators, we compiled the evidence from destroyed nests with known
   predators on our study site and from previous studies. We constructed a
   profile for each predator group and compared the evidence from 895 nests
   with unknown predators to our predator profiles using mixture-model
   analysis. This analysis indicated that 72\% of destroyed nests were
   depredated by Bald Eagles and 13\% by brown bears, and also yielded the
   probability that each nest was correctly assigned to a predator group
   based on model fit. Model testing using simulations indicated that the
   proportion estimated for eagle predation was unbiased and the proportion
   for bear predation was slightly overestimated. This approach may have
   application whenever there are adequate data on nests destroyed by known
   predators and predators exhibit different feeding behavior at nests.}},

   Cowbirds (M bonariensis), have expanded their breeding ranges to include

   Florida Scrub-jays suggests that cowbirds, should they begin to

Abstract = {{We used a combination of standardized audio-visual surveys, made over
   nine years, and vegetation analysis to determine habitat associations of
   Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) breeding in inland
   coniferous forests. Our study, in Carmanah-Walbran watersheds on
   southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, covered extensive
   contiguous tracts (> 16,000 ha) of apparently suitable habitat that
   supported a large breeding population of murrelets, a threatened
   species. Indicators of stand occupancy (circling and subcanopy flights)
   from audio-visual surveys were consistently associated with known nest
   habitat indicators (availability of platform limbs, cover and thickness
   of epiphytes on tree limbs, variable canopy structure). Both murrelet
   detections and nest microhabitat indicators were associated with a suite
   of macrohabitat variables, indicating that the most suitable habitat was
   low-elevation old-growth forest with widely spaced large trees.
   Biogeoclimatic productivity units, based on soil moisture and nutrient
   regimes, were useful proxies of habitat suitability but tree species
   composition, timber volume, and tree height, variables commonly
   available in timber inventory maps, were not. Using two principle
   component factors derived from habitat characteristics, we clustered the
   27 survey stations into three groups that differed significantly in
   occupied and subcanopy detections of murrelets and in nest habitat
   indicators. This is a useful method for combining multivariate measures
   for classifying and mapping habitat for murrelets.}},

Pages = {{67-73}},

Abstract = {{Roost counts may be a useful method for assessing and monitoring parrot
   populations as long as counting regimes can detect real differences in
   abundance above the noise of daily variability in roost size. We studied
   a roost of up to 85 Red-tailed Amazons (Amazona brasiliensis) for 28
   consecutive mornings and evenings from 12 July to 7 August 2001, and
   recorded bird behavior and associated weather data. The roost declined
   significantly over the survey period as the breeding season drew nearer.
   There was no significant difference between evening and morning roost
   counts, but we suggest that as long as misty mornings are avoided,
   morning roost counts were more effective as birds left more quickly and
   predictably. It took longer for birds to arrive on evenings when the
   roost was large, but birds left quicker in the morning when there were
   large numbers in the roost. Weather influenced both roost size and
   timing of arrival, with larger than expected numbers in the roost, and
   birds arriving later in the afternoons of sunny, warm days. We tested
   the reliability of four roost counting regimes: counts from five
   consecutive nights, five counts, one every fourth night, five nights
   picked at random, and 10 randomly picked nights. Counts from every
   fourth day performed significantly worse than all the other regimes in
   estimating the mean numbers in the roost. The 10-d random sampling
   regime performed significantly better than the 5-d regime in detecting
   very large roosts which occurred occasionally through the month.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the relationships between Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides
   borealis) group size and nest productivity. Red-cockaded Woodpecker
   group size was positively correlated with fledging success. Although the
   relationships between woodpecker group size and nest productivity
   measures were not statistically significant, a pattern of increasing
   clutch size and number of hatchlings with increasing group size was
   apparent. The presence of helpers appeared to enhance the survival of
   nestlings between hatching and fledging. The contribution that helpers
   make to nestling feeding and incubation, cavity excavation, and
   territory defense appears to have a positive effect on nest
   productivity. A threshold number of helpers may be necessary before a
   significant benefit for fledging success is realized. Nests with four
   and five group members fledged more young than nests with two or three
   group members. Whether partial brood loss occurred or not within a nest
   was primarily a function of clutch size and the number of hatchlings.
   Although partial brood loss did affect the number of young fledged from
   individual nests by removing young from nests with high numbers of
   hatchlings, woodpecker group size appeared to be the primary determinant
   of fledging success.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the nest-site characteristics of Northern Waterthrushes
   (Seiurus noveboracensis) in western Newfoundland. Based on data for 36
   nests (20 in streambanks, 16 in overturned trees) and 108 comparative
   sites, we examined habitat features at microhabitat (a 25-cm radius
   around the nest) and macrohabitat (a 5-m radius, and position on the
   landscape) scales. Assessment of microhabitat variables indicated that
   features around nests in the roots of overturned trees were no different
   from randomly selected sites. However, streambank nestsite features at
   this spatial scale distinguished these nest sites from randomly selected
   streambank locations through the presence of greater substrate slope and
   less leafy vegetation around nests. At broader spatial scales,
   streambank nests did not differ from associated random sites, but the
   macrohabitat features of nests in overturned trees distinguished them
   from randomly selected overturned-tree sites through overturned-tree
   nests being closer to water and having higher numbers of
   small-size-class deciduous trees in the surrounding habitat. Overall,
   depreciated nests had less concealment with lower numbers of coniferous
   trees within 5 m, particularly in smaller size classes. Nests in buffer
   strips had greater numbers of both deciduous and coniferous trees in
   these smaller size classes than did nests in riparian habitat adjacent
   to undisturbed forests.}},

Abstract = {{We compared three methods to determine nest predators of the Least
   Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) in San Diego County, California,
   during spring and summer 2000. Point counts and tracking stations were
   used to identify potential predators and video photography to document
   actual nest predators. Parental behavior at depredated nests was
   compared to that at successful nests to determine whether activity
   (frequency of trips to and from the nest) and singing vs. non-singing on
   the nest affected nest predation. Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens)
   were the most abundant potential avian predator, followed by Western
   Scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica). Coyotes (Canis latrans) were
   abundant, with smaller mammalian predators occurring in low abundance.
   Cameras documented a 48\% predation rate with scrub-jays as the major
   nest predators (67\%), but Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana,
   17\%), gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus, 8\%) and Argentine ants
   (Linepithema humile, 8\%) were also confirmed predators. Identification
   of potential predators from tracking stations and point counts
   demonstrated only moderate correspondence with actual nest predators.
   Parental behavior at the nest prior to depredation was not related to
   nest outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Thick-billed Parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) nest sites were studied
   during a six-year period (1995-2000) at six nesting areas in the Sierra
   Madre Occidental in Mexico. Nests were found in 187 snags or live trees
   of seven species, which averaged 75.2 cm dbh. Most nests were in snags
   (59\%), and only two nests occurred in trees or snags under 40 cm dbh.
   Most nests occurred in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii 32.6\%), and
   Mexican white pine (Pinus ayacahuite, 21.9\%). Nest-site characteristics
   observed in the study were compared with those reported in the
   literature 20 yrs ago by Lanning and Shiflett (1983), and important
   differences were found in the percentages of tree species used. Decline
   of the Thick-billed Parrot seems to be related to large-scale logging
   over a wider historical breeding range. Commercial timber harvesting
   appears to affect nest site availability by leaving few snags and pine
   trees large enough for parrots to nest in.}},

Abstract = {{Rising sea levels in the mid-Atlantic region pose a long-term threat to
   marshes and their avian inhabitants. The Gull-billed Tern (Sterna
   nilotica), Common Tern (S. hirundo), Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger), and
   American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), species of concern in
   Virginia, nest oil low shelly perimeters of salt marsh islands on the
   Eastern Shore of Virginia. Marsh shellpiles are free of mammalian
   predators, but subject to frequent floods that reduce reproductive
   success. In an attempt to examine nest-site selection, enhance habitat,
   and improve hatching success, small (2 X 2 m) plots on five island
   shellpiles were experimentally elevated, and nest-site selection and
   hatching success were monitored from 1 May to 1 August, 2002. In
   addition, location, elevation, and nesting performance of all other
   nests in the colonies were also monitored. No species selected the
   elevated experimental plots preferentially over adjacent control plots
   at any of the sites. When all nests were considered, Common Tern nests
   were located significantly lower than were random point elevations at
   two sires, as they tended to concentrate on low-lying wrack. At two
   other sites, however, Common Tern nests were significantly higher than
   were random points. Gull-billed Terns and American Oystercatchers showed
   a weak preference for higher elevations on bare shell at most sites.
   Hatching success was not improved on elevated plots, despite the
   protection they provided from flooding. Because of a 7 June flood, when
   47\% of all nests flooded, hatching success for all species was low.
   Nest elevation had the strongest impact on a nest's probability of
   hatching, followed by nest-initiation date. Predation rates were high at
   small colonies, and Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) depredated
   90\% of early Gull-billed Tern nests at one shellpile. The importance of
   nest elevation and flooding on hatching success demonstrates the
   potential for management of certain waterbird nesting sites. Facing
   threats from predators on barrier islands and rising sea levels
   especially in the mid-Atlantic region, several species of nesting
   waterbirds may benefit dramatically with modest: manipulation of even
   small habitat patches on isolated marsh islands.}},

Abstract = {{A captive study was conducted to determine the most appropriate method
   for attaching radio transmitters to a medium-sized (20-100 g) passerine,
   the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Using mock transmitters, three
   methods of attachment were tried: a body harness, a glued backpack, and
   a tail-mount. The harness was the most reliable in terms of duration of
   attachment, with six of eight attachments (75\%) retained by the birds
   at the completion of the 24-d trial. In contrast, just two of eight
   (25\%) glued backpack attachments remained in place at the conclusion of
   the study. Tail-mounts performed only slightly better than glued
   backpacks, with only three of eight tail-mounts remaining in place at
   the conclusion of the study. Flight, feeding, and perching activities
   were not affected by the attachments; however, some birds showed initial
   annoyance toward the mock radio transmitters, inferred by pecking
   directed at the attachment site. Each attachment method was found to
   slightly alter the activity (pecking) of the starlings compared to the
   control group, but this persisted only for the first day following
   attachment. On the basis of the pecking response, tail-mount attachments
   were the least aggravating to the birds followed by the harness method.
   Once adjusted to the attachment, we observed no difference in starling
   activity, and the body condition of control and treated birds remained
   similar for the duration of the trials. We recommend the use of the
   harness for attaching radio transmitters to European Starlings and other
   similar sized passerines, particularly if birds are expected to molt
   during the experimental period.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored 67 Golden-cheeked Warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia) nests
   with infrared video cameras and time-lapse recorders to identify
   predators. Rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) were the most frequent predators,
   depredating 12 nests and capturing three adult females. A variety of
   avian predators depredated seven nests, including three American Crows
   (Corvus brachyrynchos), two Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), one
   Western Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma californica), and one Coopers Hawk
   (Accipiter cooperii). Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) depredated four
   nests and were the only mammalian predators recorded. Post-outcome
   recordings (i.e., after young fledged or nests failed) revealed western
   coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), mice (Peromyscus sp.), and
   Greater Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) as potential predators,
   though they were not recorded at active nests. Video proved to be an
   effective method of monitoring Golden-checked Warbler nests, because all
   but one predator was identified and only two nests (3\%) were abandoned.}},

Abstract = {{The Long-tailed Wood-Partridge (Dendrortyx macroura) is a species
   endemic to Mexico, inhabiting dense coniferous forests of the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur, of which
   little is known about its ecology and conservation status. The abundance
   and density of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge was estimated by point
   Counts with playback distance sampling from March-October of 1998-2000
   in a temperate coniferous forest managed for timber production by a
   Mexican indigenous community. The average detection rate was 0.31
   individuals per point, resulting in a mean estimate for Population
   density of 20.9 birds/km(2) and a mean population estimate of 2679
   individuals, estimated using the half-normal key function with cosine
   adjustments. Density estimates of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge were 8
   individuals/km(2) in dry, open, scrubby habitats with deep ash and sand
   volcanic deposits subject to intense human use and in closed canopy,
   humid forests with moderate human disturbance. Density estimates were
   14.6 and 21.5 individuals/km(2) in humid, closed canopy,
   multi-stratified forests. The latter areas are recommended as the core
   area for protection of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge.}},

Abstract = {{We provide data on three instances where Tree Swallows (Tacbycineta
   bicolor) that fledged from the same nest (broodmates) eventually bred
   together in subsequent years. Two instances were detected in Ontario and
   a third was detected in Nova Scotia. Based on demographics at the times
   of each event, we estimated probabilities of these broodmate pairings as
   approximately 1 in 16,000, 1 in 5600, and 1 in 29,000, respectively,
   whereas the number of identified pairs in the populations was less than
   65 in each case. Thus, inbreeding occurred at a higher frequency than
   expected by chance. We cannot distinguish whether these identical natal
   dispersal responses arose from similarity genes or in rearing
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{We used a recorded song of the Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis)
   to determine whether recorded vocalizations improved detection of this
   secretive species in winter. Surveys were conducted in the Red Hills
   region of northern Florida and southwestern Georgia under a range of
   climatic conditions. Bachman's Sparrows responded readily to taped
   vocalizations and were detected only on surveys where recorded
   vocalizations were used. A total of 251 individuals (mean = 1.01 per
   stop) was observed, or approximately 10-15 observations/h. Detections
   decreased at lower ambient temperatures and also varied among sites, but
   adequate numbers were observed even when maximum daytime temperatures
   remained < 3degrees C. We believe variation in the number of sparrows
   observed among sites may relate to variation in ground cover. Bachman's
   Sparrows were most common in areas with extensive native ground cover,
   but further studies are needed. We recommend use of recorded
   vocalizations in winter surveys of Bachman's Sparrows and suggest
   recorded vocalizations may help in winter surveys of other secretive
   sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{We examined nest predation rates at artificial nests in two contrasting
   habitats (open woodland and shrubland) inside the Reserve of Nacunan,
   west-central Argentina and in open woodlands within the reserve and a
   nearby grazed area, to assess whether between-habitat differences in
   vegetative structure were associated with changes in nest predation
   levels. We also quantified diurnal and nocturnal predation rates to
   further characterize the predator assemblage of the reserve. Nest
   predation rates and the estimated daily mortality rates were quite high
   in both open woodland and shrubland and did not differ significantly
   between them. Nest predation rate and daily mortality rate of nests in
   open woodlands of the reserve were high bur similar to the rates for
   nests in adjacent grazed open woodlands. Nearly all predation events
   occurred during daylight hours. This result was not an artifact of the
   use of quail eggs because the proportion of depredated nests during the
   night was similar when we used smaller eggs of captive passerines. Our
   results support previous findings on the prevalence of birds as nest
   predators in this area. Avian predators seemed to be efficient at
   locating Our artificial nests in all habitats, leading to the lack of
   differences between treatments. Conversely, our results suggest that
   extensive cattle grazing does not greatly modify nest predation risk for
   above-ground nests, although this conclusion is provisional given the
   conditions under which our experiments were carried out.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the arthropods present in the digestive tracts of
   human-imprinted gamebird chicks after foraging may provide a more
   biologically relevant assessment of arthropod availability in
   brood-rearing habitats. It may also provide information on food
   selection by chicks. An assumption of this methodology is that
   diagnostic fragments of arthropods (i.e., those body fragments used to
   identify taxa) are not passed out of the gizzard before chicks are
   euthanized. We investigated the passage of diagnostic fragments of six
   arthropod species within the digestive tract of 10 d-old Northern
   Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) chicks. Although fragments of arthropods
   were found in the intestines of a few chicks, arthropod-diagnostic
   fragments were only found in the crop and gizzard. The results of this
   study suggest that diagnostic fragments of arthropods ingested by
   human-imprinted chicks are not excreted within a 40-min foraging period.}},

Abstract = {{American Avocers (Recurvirostra americana) and Black-necked Stilts
   (Himantopus mexicanus) are large ground-nesting shorebirds whose eggs
   and flightless chicks are exposed to a variety of predators during a
   period of approximately two months. Parents respond to potential
   predators by ignoring them, by performing a variety of diversionary
   displays, or by aggressive mobbing. I observed the responses of avocets
   and stilts to natural predators and to predator models placed near their
   nests. Responses to mammals were relatively weak, involving mostly
   aerial circling and terrestrial distraction displays, and mammals rarely
   were mobbed. Responses to birds were more aerial, with ground displays
   rarely used, and birds often were mobbed. The response to humans was
   intermediate between the responses to other mammalian predators and to
   avian predators, and involved both distraction displays and mobbing. The
   number of avocets and stilts participating in mobbing eight different
   avian predators correlated with a subjective ranking of the danger the
   predators posed to mobbing adults. Mobbing of gulls, raptors, and herons
   was consistent with the hypothesis that avocet and stilt mobbing
   behaviour is influenced by the relative threat of particular predators
   to eggs versus chicks. Overall, the observations reported here provide
   evidence that parent avocets and stilts discriminate among predators on
   the basis of both the risk to the adults of mobbing the predator and the
   risk to the eggs or chicks of not doing so.}},

Abstract = {{We measured wing chord, tail length and mass and estimated levels of
   subcutaneous fat deposits of Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus)
   trapped at Cedar Grove, Wisconsin. Wing chord, tail length, and mass all
   showed a sudden increase beginning about 10 October in adults and
   juveniles and in males and females despite the fact that adults migrate
   about 20 d later than juveniles and males migrate later than females.
   Migrants captured at Cedar Grove late in the season did not differ
   significantly in wing chord or tail length from migrants captured at the
   Goshutes in eastern Nevada. We suggest that an increasing proportion of
   the birds captured at Cedar Grove after 10 October are of western origin
   because winds are more westerly in October than in September. The
   greater mass of Cedar Grove birds may be because of greater availability
   of prey than in the Goshutes or because the lower mass of birds in the
   Goshutes is a facultative adaptation for easier passage through the arid
   west.}},

Abstract = {{Male Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) face intense sperm competition
   because mated pairs copulate frequently, extra-pair copulations are
   common, and females store sperm. We examined the effects of repeated
   sampling on the characteristics of Tree Swallow semen by manually
   expressing semen from 15 males immediately after capture (T-0) and then
   hourly for 4 h (T-1 - T-4). The semen characteristics of individual
   males varied in response to repeated sampling. The total number of sperm
   cells we obtained from each male over the 4-h sampling period varied
   from 10(4)-10(7). Semen samples lacking sperm increased from 6.7\% of
   T-0 samples to 26.7-33.3\% of subsequent samples. Forty percent of males
   provided at least one semen sample that lacked sperm. There were no
   significant differences among hourly samples in semen volume, sperm
   concentration, or in the total number of sperm cells obtained from each
   male. However, there were significant differences among males in each of
   these variables. Semen volumes represented small proportions of cloacal
   protuberance volumes. We did not detect significant correlations between
   total semen volumes or total number of sperm cells obtained from males
   from T-0-T-4 and cloacal protuberance volumes. Total semen volume and
   number of sperm cells obtained from T-0-T-4 significantly increased with
   date. However, sperm concentration was not significantly correlated with
   date. We did not detect significant correlations between semen
   characteristics and male morphology. Individual variation in responses
   to repeated sampling has implications for the copulatory strategies of
   male and female Tree Swallows.}},

   in flocks with Greylag Geese (Anser anser) on stubble-fields in northern
   Germany. I measured scans/min and total scan duration, and I calculated
   mean scan duration. There was an inverse correlation between group size
   and scanning for Mallards, but not when geese and Mallards were
   considered as a combined flock. Mallards did not benefit from the
   presence of geese in terms of reduced vigilance, and they seemed to
   adjust their vigilance according only to Mallard flock sizes. Vigilance
   was higher in the presence of geese and may have been directed towards
   geese as potential competitors. No differences in vigilance between male

Abstract = {{Eggs that are abnormally small are called runt eggs, and they occur in
   clutches across a wide variety of bird species. We surveyed waterfowl
   researchers to determine the natural frequency of occurrence of runt
   eggs in wild nesting ducks, geese, and swans. Of 551,632 eggs examined,
   215 were runts, yielding a frequency of 0.039\%. They occurred at about
   four times this frequency (0.156\% in 21,832 eggs) in a museum oological
   collection. Runt eggs were not significantly more common within any
   taxonomic group among wild waterfowl, and their occurrence was not
   related to the mean clutch size of a species or to whether waterfowl
   exhibited regular conspecific nest parasitism. Cavity-nesting waterfowl
   had lower incidences of runt eggs than ground-nesting species. Our
   results represent the largest examination of the occurrence of this size
   anomaly in eggs of wild birds, and are consistent with the hypothesis
   that runt eggs result from a temporary impairment of the reproductive
   tract. This may explain why runt eggs occur in all bird species studied.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Stopover areas are vital for the successful migration of many species of
   shorebirds, as they, in part, allow individuals to deposit large
   quantities of Fat needed to fuel their northward and southward journeys.
   While much research has focused on bird migration, few studies closely
   examine the environmental characteristics of specific stopover areas.
   For our study, we conducted prey availability surveys and documented
   shorebird habitat use during northward summer migration for three
   historically important stopover areas along the Connecticut Long Island
   Sound coastline in 2000. Coastal Connecticut provides important habitat
   not only for shorebirds migrating from northern Canada to South America,
   but also for resident breeding shorebirds (e.g., oystercatcliers,
   plovers, and sandpipers). Our prey availability surveys indicate that
   all three stopover sites were characterized by some combination of
   polychaete worms, crustaceans, and mollusks. Polychaete worms of the
   family Neredidae were the most common prey item at two of the three
   sites. In addition, the site frequented by the greatest densities of
   shorebirds also had the greatest density of nereid worms and the
   greatest diversity of invertebrates. In terms of habitat use, our
   results indicate that foraging densities tended to be highest on
   intertidal habitats that were sheltered from coastal wave action and
   where densities of benthic (burrowing) and epifaunal (surface-dwelling)
   prey tended to be high. However, some shorebird species, including one
   breeding resident, the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) and
   one migrant, the Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres), both of special
   management concern, favored foraging on beach-front habitats. In
   contrast to foraging habitat preferences, shorebirds roosting at high
   tidal phases showed strong preferences for beach habitats fronting the
   Long Island Sound. The use of beach-front habitats for both foraging and
   roosting poses a challenging situation for beach managers.}},

Abstract = {{Nest-dwelling parasites are known to have detrimental consequences for
   many birds, and thus it may be desirable for management practices to
   remove these parasites. In addition, manipulation of parasite loads is
   often necessary for studying host-parasite evolution. While there are
   various methods that are effective at reducing parasite loads in nests,
   many of them have shortcomings because they require specialized
   equipment, are time consuming, or involve toxic substances that may be
   dangerous to both birds and researchers. I evaluated the efficacy of
   simple-to-use, non-toxic diatomaceous earth (DE) at reducing
   ectoparasite loads in nests of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) over
   two field seasons. Diatomaceous earth significantly reduced population
   sizes of bird fleas (Ceratophyllus idius) and various species of blow
   flies (Protocalliphora spp.) in both years. Diatomaceous earth appeared
   to be more effective at reducing the numbers of fleas, possibly because
   fleas have smaller body size and so are more easily desiccated by the
   abrasive action of DE. Although DE was effective against both fleas and
   blow flies, it did not completely rid nests of either type of parasite.}},

Abstract = {{I assessed nest-site characteristics of two cavity-excavating species,
   the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerves formicivorus) and Northern Flicker
   (Colaptes auratus), and two secondary cavity-nesting species, the
   Flammulated Owl (Otus flammeolus) and Western Bluebird (Sialia
   mexicana). These species were common in mixed coniferous-deciduous
   forests within my New Mexico study areas. I predicted that nests of the
   woodpecker species could be differentiated by cavity size and that the
   excavator species of nest cavities used by secondary cavity-nesters
   could be predicted with this model. Flickers excavated nest cavities
   that were larger and surrounded by denser forest than Acorn Woodpecker
   nests, and three characteristics of cavity size alone differentiated
   84\% of woodpecker nest sites. Acorn Woodpeckers nested in live Gambel
   oak (Quercus gambelit) most frequently and Northern Flickers in
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags, and these differences may be
   attributed to the excavation ability of each species. The secondary
   cavity-nesters did not show a preference for trees of different
   condition (i.e., alive or dead). A multivariate regression model
   predicted that Flammulated Owls and Western Bluebirds should nest in
   cavities excavated by both woodpeckers, but owls showed a preference for
   Northern Flicker cavities and bluebirds for Acorn Woodpecker cavities.
   Owl nest cavities were larger and surrounded by denser forest than
   bluebird nest cavities, similar to the differences observed between
   woodpecker nest sites. I suggest that these differences can be partially
   attributed to body size as well as ecological similarities between the
   primary and secondary cavity-nesters. Western Bluebirds showed a
   preference for cavities facing south and east, and this may have been
   due to thermal advantages.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{We studied the prey base, foraging behavior, and energetics of Snowy
   Egrets (Egretta thula) and Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in the Arthur Kill
   region of New York-New Jersey during the 2002 breeding season. Prey
   density increased 10-fold, from 0.12 to 12.0 items/m(2) between May and
   August, with the greatest increase occurring in young-of-the-year
   mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus). Despite increases in prey biomass,
   birds had higher foraging success in May (47\%) than in August (28\%).
   This decrease may have been the result of predator confusion and/or
   foraging inexperience by newly fledged birds. As a result, birds
   experienced a net gain of 227.0 W in May and 52.5 W in August. Striking
   at prey was more costly for Great Egrets (4.15 J, 4.88 W/strike) than
   for Snowy Egrets (0.34 J, 0.30 W/strike). Pursuing prey by walking and
   running was relatively inexpensive; Snowy Egrets and Great Egrets spent
   0.04 W and 0.06 W, respectively. Snowy Egrets averaged 0.13 m/s while
   foraging, while Great Egrets moved at a third of that speed (0.04 m/s),
   supporting the notion that Snowy Egrets could disturb prey that then
   become more accessible to Great Egrets. Snowy Egrets moved faster in
   August than in May, but Great Egrets maintained or slowed their foraging
   speed. Sixty-six percent of the variation in Great Egret energy intake
   was accounted for by four variables (date, steps, obtuse turns, and
   attacks from other birds), while 39\% of the variation in Snowy Egret
   energy intake was accounted for by three variables (date, tide, and
   obtuse turns). Snowy Egrets may sample more foraging locations than
   Great Egrets, the latter species choosing locations where other birds
   have already found prey.}},

   that sample conservation and transport are correct to avoid confounding

   samples can be centrifuged and frozen any time within eight hours of
   collection, as during this period there are no significant changes in
   stress protein HSP70 and HSP60 levels. These findings simplify future
   research on the stress protein response in wild birds because samples
   can be safely kept in a cool box for a relatively long time.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the potential expression of territorial behavior of
   Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) in southwestern Idaho, we used a
   playback protocol to determine if Burrowing Owls actively defended their
   nesting site from conspecifics, and if so, to determine the extent of
   their territorial boundaries. Eighty-eight percent of male Burrowing
   Owls responded to the broadcast of conspecific primary calls. All
   responsive males uttered primary calls, and many owls approached the
   broadcast speaker, exhibited white-and-tall stances, and bobbed. Females
   responded less frequently than males, but one female whose mate was
   presumably dead exhibited an intense response to the playback trial.
   There were no differences in number of primary calls uttered, number of
   white-and-tall stances performed, or number of bobs of focal males among
   three broadcast distances: (0 m, 50 in, and 100 in) from the active nest
   burrows. However, focal owls approached the broadcast speaker more
   closely at broadcast distances of 0 in and 50 in than at 100 in. These
   findings suggest that owls actively defended their nesting site from
   conspecifics and that they defended an area larger than that immediately
   surrounding the nest burrow. Although they continued to vocalize at
   distances of at least 100 in, they did not physically approach an
   intruder at this distance as frequently as at shorter distances.
   Therefore, Burrowing Owls appear to defend a territory that encompasses
   some, but not all, of the foraging area used during nesting.}},

Abstract = {{Food supplementation can be an important experimental technique in
   studies of avian reproductive ecology, energetics, and parental care. We
   developed a method of food supplementation suitable for ground-foraging
   insectivorous passerines and tested it on Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)
   and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina). We provided mealworms at
   feeding stations made of plastic transparency film covered with a thin
   layer of green moss. Feeding stations were placed on the ground or on
   logs or boulders in the vicinity of nests. Direct and indirect evidence
   suggested that 92\% of breeding Ovenbirds and 79\% of breeding Wood
   Thrushes used supplemental food. The impact of non-target consumers was
   not significant: they were observed eating mealworms at approximately
   one-third of our food-supplemented nests. However, diurnal non-target
   consumers were only detected on a single occasion for each species, and
   nocturnal consumers fed on small amounts of mealworms left after daytime
   feeding experiments. This method proved very effective for Ovenbirds and
   Wood Thrushes, and it may be applicable to other ground-foraging
   insectivorous passerines.}},

Abstract = {{From 1994-1996 we investigated effects of Brown-headed Cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) parasitism on Black-throated Sparrow (Amphispiza
   bilineata) nesting success in the Verde Valley of central Arizona. Of 56
   Black-throated Sparrow nests, 52\% were parasitized. Black-throated
   Sparrows appear to respond to natural parasitism by accepting the
   cowbird egg, deserting the nest, or burying the cowbird egg. Removal and
   damage of host eggs by female cowbirds effectively reduced clutch size
   from an average of 3.4 to 1.9 eggs. Because of this reduced clutch size,
   Black-throated Sparrow reproductive success was significantly lower in
   parasitized nests (0.2 young fledged/nest) as compared to nonparasitized
   nests (1.6 young fledged/nest). When comparing cowbird parasitism
   between two habitat types, we found significantly higher parasitism
   frequencies in crucifixion-thorn (Canotia holacantha) versus
   creosote-bush (Larrea divaricata) habitat. We argue that this difference
   in parasitism is due to the greater number of tall perches (e.g., shrubs
   >4 m) available in crucifixion-thorn habitat, providing vantage points
   for female cowbirds to better find Black-throated Sparrow nests.}},

Abstract = {{We documented the time of day of laying and the total time spent on the
   nest chiring laying (laying bout) in 21 species of passerine birds and
   the brood-parasitic Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) at Delta
   Marsh, Manitoba, between 1989 and 1995. Brown-headed Cowhirds laid oil
   average 31.2 min before sunrise, whereas mean laying times of the other
   species ranged from 11.3 min after sunrise through early afternoon.
   Species that laid later in the day tended to spend more time on their
   nests during laying. Smaller species tended to lay earlier in the day
   and had significantly shorter laying hours than larger species. Future
   studies accounting for variation in foraging and reproductive behavior
   and predation risk between taxonomic groups may explain additional
   variation in laying time and duration.}},

Abstract = {{We compared 50-m fixcd-radius point-count detections for four bird
   species with density data from spot-mapping in order to evaluate the
   relationship between monitoring methodologies. We conducted this study
   in five Missouri oak-hickory forest Study sites over eight years. There
   were significant positive correlations between monitoring methods, but
   the strength of these relationships varied for Acadian Flycatchers
   (Empidonax virescens), Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), Worm-eating
   Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla
   mustelina). There was significant bias associated with the point-count
   detections for Acadian Flycatchers. Worm-eating Warblers, and Wood
   Thrushes. The direction and degree of bias varied; for example, Acadian
   Flycatchers and Worm-eating Warblers were on average significantly
   overestimated by point Counts, whereas the Wood Thrush was significantly
   Underestimated and Ovenbirds were Slightly Underestimated. The magnitude
   and direction of the bias error varied with spot-map density estimates
   of the species, but was not related to specific study sites Or years.
   Thus 50-m radius fixed-radius point Counts appear to reflect general
   density trends for the four species, especially for Ovenbirds, but there
   are also density related biases associated with point-count detections.}},

Abstract = {{Data from a banding station at Guantanamo Bay and the examination of 830
   specimens were used to study molt patterns and criteria for
   determination of age and sex in 15 resident species Of Cuban landbirds.
   All 15 species undergo their prebasic molt in August to November, with a
   few species commencing as early as May and/or completing as late as
   December. This timing corresponded with that of related taxa found in
   North America. With few exceptions, the extent of the first prebasic
   molts was also comparable to those of related taxa found at northern
   latitudes, being partial to incomplete in all nine passerines and four
   of six nonpasserines. Three species showed evidence of eccentric primary
   molt patterns during the first prebasic molt, to be expected in birds
   residing in scrubby or exposed environments Such as those Found at
   Guantanamo Bay. Determination of age is possible in most Cuban landbirds
   based on molt limits and the shape and condition of the primary coverts
   and rectrices, criteria very similar to those found in North American
   species of related taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Song variation has been studied extensively over the past 50 yr but
   almost entirely in oscine passerines. Although learning is an essential
   component of song development in most, if not all, oscines, there is no
   definitive evidence for song learning in suboscine passerines. This
   suggests that the patterns and extent of individual and geographic
   variation may differ between these groups as well. We examined
   individual variation in the ``fee-bee-o{''} song in a Population of
   Alder Flycatchers (Empidonax alnorum) in southwestern Alberta. Songs of
   individual males were recorded during the breeding season in 2001. We
   measured temporal and frequency variables of songs and Conducted
   univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to characterize
   variation Within and among individuals. There was little variation among
   the songs of an individual male during single recording sessions and
   across recordings made over the breeding season. All measured variables
   varied significantly more among than within individuals. Discriminant
   function analysis assigned 91-100\% of songs to the correct individual.
   Therefore, there was sufficient variation among individual males to
   identify them statistically and, potentially, to permit individual
   discrimination by the birds.}},

Abstract = {{Shorebirds held during banding activities can develop muscle cramps,
   especially when temperatures are high and birds are heavy. Such capture
   myopathy can be fatal or tender birds vulnerable to predators. We
   rehabilitated Great Knots (Calidris tenuirostris), Red Knots (C
   canutus), Bar-tailed Godwits (Limoia lapponica), and Red-necked Stints
   (C. ruficollis) in northwestern Australia. We kept birds in slings (if
   cramped) or in a small cage (if able to walk) and gave them daily
   standing exercises. Recovery of severely cramped birds took up to 14 cl,
   which may reflect a Critical period of tissue regeneration. Of 15 knots
   (8 Red and 7 Great) taken into captivity, 12 were rehabilitated and
   released. The resighting rate after the breeding season of the
   rehabilitated birds was the same as for other birds color-banded during
   our research, indicating that the rehabilitation was successful. We
   conclude that rehabilitating cramped shorebirds is possible though
   time-consuming. A sex bias in susceptibility to capture myopathy is
   suggested by seven of the eight Red Knots treated being male; the sex
   ratio in the local Population was 1: 1.}},

   pewee nests. At Delta Marsh, Manitoba, we inspected Eastern Wood-Pewee
   (C virens) nests to determine parasitism frequency and experimentally
   parasitized pewee nests with real and artificial Brown-headed Cowbird
   eggs to assess their response to parasitism. No parasitism was recorded
   at 20 unmanipulated nests or at 12 experimentally parasitized nests,
   whereas all real and artificial cowbird eggs were accepted. The lack of
   observed parasitism, therefore, was not an artifact of cowbird egg
   rejection. We suggest the lack of parasitism on Eastern Wood-Pewees at
   Delta Marsh reflects a partial asynchrony between the parasite's and
   host's laying seasons and possibly the high placement of pewee nests.
   However, these factors may not explain the lack of parasitism at all
   other sites in North America or on other Contopus species.}},

Abstract = {{The double observer approach with marked nests was used in southern
   France for estimating the detection probability of nests of the Squacco
   Heron (Ardeola ralloides), a cryptic species in its breeding behavior.
   Results indicate that the detection probability varied from 0.518 to
   0.700 between observers. The overall detection probability, i.e., the
   probability that a nest was detected by at least one observer, was
   0.856. Given a total of 66 nests found by both observers during the
   surveys, the breeding population was estimated at 77 nests. Since
   previous estimates of the Squacco Heron breeding population size did not
   take into account detection probability, we suggest that the breeding
   population is larger than previously thought in the Camargue and in
   other European breeding localities.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a short-term Study on density and habitat use in an
   Amazonian owl assemblage. The census was conducted in terra-firme forest
   and black-water flooded forest or igapo forest. Six owl species were
   recorded, the Tropical Screech-owl (Otus choliba), the Tawny-bellied Owl
   (O. watsonii), the Black-banded Owl (Strix huhula), the Spectacled Owl
   (Pulsatrix perspicillata), the Ferruginous Pygmy-owl (Glaucidium
   brasilianum), and the Stygian Owl (Asio stygius). The most abundant
   species was the Tawny-bellied Owl (0.42 individuals/ha) followed by the
   Spectacled Owl (0.31 individuals/ha). Some species showed clear
   tendencies to use different habitats. The Tawny-bellied Owl was more
   abundant in terra-firme forest, while its congener, the Tropical
   Screech-owl, was much more common in igapo forest. The Stygian Owl and
   the Ferruginous Pygmy-owl were also recorded exclusively in the igapo
   forest census. These results indicate that terra-firme forest and igapo
   forest supported distinct owl assemblages. Our work and other studies
   suggest regional variability in owl density in Amazonia.}},

   distances developed significantly higher heterophildymphocyte ratios
   than those moved shorter distances. However, no significant difference

   of the variation in carbon stable isotope ratio was explained by,
   differences between nests, the within-nest variation being explained by
   laying order. These data indicate significant differences in diet choice
   between individual females and changes in food choice or body-store
   dynamics during egg laying. Among-egg variation in the carbon stable
   isotope ratios of the yolk were closely reflected in the hatchling down,
   on average down being enriched by 3.1parts per thousand delta(13)C
   relative to yolk. Our findings support the contention that pre-laying

   Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a cavity-nesting species. I conducted a
   field test to determine whether model presentations affected fledging
   success of an open-cup nesting species, the Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia
   citrina). In 1999, 1 presented predator models at the nests of Hooded
   Warblers at the Hemlock Hill Biological Research Area in northwestern
   Pennsylvania. I compared the fledging success of this species in 1999
   with fledging Success in the four previous years at the same Study site
   when no such tests took place. Predator model presentations during the
   nestling stage had no effect on fledging success of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Current estimates of annual survival, an important process affecting
   population dynamics, are lacking for breeding-waterfowl populations in
   Washington. I used hunting-season recoveries in conjunction with
   band-recovery models (program MARK) to estimate survival and recovery
   probabilities of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Gadwalls (A.
   strepera) banded in eastern Washington during 1981-1998. I also
   evaluated hypotheses about sources of variation in these rates and
   described the geographical and temporal distribution of band recoveries.
   Mallard survival and recovery probabilities were sex and age-specific,
   and recovery rates were year-specific but not strongly correlated with
   harvest regulations. Survival probability of Mallards was 0.661 for
   adult males, 0.660 for immature females, 0.606 for adult females, and
   0.560 for immature males. Average recovery rates were generally highest
   for immature males (0.083) followed by adult males (0.050), immature
   females (0.050), and adult females (0.029). Survival and recovery rates
   of Gadwalls were 0.576 and 0.054, respectively, but sample size was
   small (52 recoveries from 436 banded birds) and sex-age classes were
   pooled prior to analysis. Seventy-two percent of Mallards banded in
   eastern Washington were recovered in the Columbia Basin of central
   Washington. The proportion of adult-male recoveries decreased in the
   Columbia Basin (from 75\% in 1981-84 to 54\% in 1995-98) and increased
   in California (from 4\% to 22\%). The distribution of direct recoveries
   of Gadwalls was similar to Mallards. My data suggest that annual
   survival of Mallards and Gadwalls banded in eastern Washington was
   similar to or slightly higher than survival probabilities in other North
   America populations.}},

Abstract = {{Female Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) give a loud series of chips
   as they leave their nest during incubation and brooding. I tested the
   efficacy of basing breeding population surveys on the nest departure
   call (NDC). For a subset of point-count surveys designed to estimate the
   abundance and distribution of Swamp Sparrows in the coastal mid-Atlantic
   States, I surveyed singing males and (in a longer survey) the number of
   different females uttering NDCs. A set of 31 points was surveyed in
   early June and a subset of 21 in early July. The number of NDCs was well
   correlated with the number of singing males detected in the early
   season. The number of females giving NDCs was consistently smaller than
   the number of singing males. In part, this is because the detection
   distance for NDC is significantly shorter than for male song. However,
   even within a small fixed circular plot, more males were detected.
   Singing-male surveys provide more data over a shorter period of time and
   are appropriate for large-scale surveys. However, female NDCs provide an
   index of actual reproductive activity with no unmated birds included.
   Although a longer survey period is required, the surveys can be
   conducted throughout the day. It is suggested that female vocalizations
   related to nesting activity are more widespread than is generally
   appreciated and, when possible, should be used at least as complementary
   data to singing-male surveys.}},

   sasin) and 203 Rufous Hummingbirds (S. rufus) at a site in central
   coastal California. Adult Allen's occurred from late January to early
   August and juveniles from early April to early September. Overall ratios
   of female to male Allen's were 2.5:1 for adults, 1:1.1 for juveniles.
   The breeding season female-to-male ratio for adult Allen's of 6.2:1
   probably reflected net placement at riparian edges between nests and
   feeding areas for females. Adult Rufous occurred as transients from
   mid-February to early May and late June to mid-August and juveniles from
   mid June to late September. Overall ratios of female to male Rufous were
   2.3:1 for adults in spring, 1:1.1 for juveniles. For adults, there was
   little evidence for a spring migration peak in Allen's, but a fall
   migration peak was marked. In contrast, adult Rufous showed a spring
   migration peak but were rare in fall. The two species' main southbound
   routes in California (coastal for Allen's, interior for Rufous) may, in
   combination with temporal separation, help partition nectar resources.
   Capture rates for both age groups of Allen's Hummingbirds indicated a
   stable population. Juvenile Rufous showed a significant decline in
   capture rates, reasons for which are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{We documented Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) entering natural
   burrows on six different occasions on a dry prairie in central Florida.
   Use of burrows was apparently an attempt to escape potential predators.
   Although Bachman's Sparrows were usually flushed from grass-dominated
   microsites, they preferred to fly to palmetto clumps (Serenoa repens)
   that had burrows rather than palmetto clumps lacking burrows. This
   behavior has inherent risks because these burrows are often used by a
   variety of animals, including predators of small passerines.}},

Abstract = {{Using direct observations of Buff-breasted Wrens (Thryothorus leucotis),
   I examined timing and duration of egg laying, the behavior of females
   and males around the time of laying, and duetting and solo singing on
   laying and non-laying mornings. When laying, females roosted either
   alone in breeding nests or with their mates in dormitory nests, and left
   them on average 3.5 min before sunrise. Females returned to their nests
   at 18.6 min after sunrise and took 21.1 min to lay their eggs. Almost
   all females were accompanied by their mates to the nest before laying,
   most males foraged near the nest during laying, and nearly all pairs
   re-united shortly after laying. Pairs sang significantly fewer duets and
   females gave significantly fewer solo songs on laying versus non-laying
   mornings, while males did not change their solo singing behavior.
   Singing was not restricted to times when females were off their nests,
   as some pairs duetted and some males gave solo songs while females were
   laying. These results suggest that females lay their eggs at a time of
   day which is unfavorable in terms of duetting, and, in turn, for defence
   of mates and territories.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the nesting success of the Meadow Bunting (Embriza cioides)

   in northeast China from 1998 to 2000. Nest loss rates along abrupt edges

   succession was allowed to occur. Meadow Bunting nests failed mostly
   because of nest predation and nest occupation. Nest predation varied
   significantly among different kinds of habitat edges, with predation
   rates significantly higher on abrupt edges than on gradual edges. Levels
   of nest occupation by Brown Shrikes varied significantly among edge
   types but did not vary among sites and among years. Brood parasitism by
   cuckoos did not differ among edge types and years. Clutch sizes,
   however, were significantly smaller along agricultural edges, suggesting
   either decreased food availability or a population dominated by younger
   or lower quality birds.}},

Abstract = {{Philopatry and habitat selection were examined for migratory populations
   of the two sympatric shrike species, the Bull-headed (Lanius bucephalus)
   and Brown (L. cristatus) shrikes in northern Japan between 1992 and
   1997. Although 18\% of banded Bull-headed Shrike males returned to the
   previous breeding area, no female did. In Brown Shrikes, 43\% and 13\%
   of banded males and females, respectively, returned to the area. Brown
   Shrikes are significantly more philopatric than Bull-headed Shrikes.
   Even successful breeders in Bull-headed Shrikes did not always return to
   the area near their nesting site of the previous year. Successful
   breeders in Brown Shrikes were faithful to their past breeding site.
   Brown Shrikes decreased by 67\% due to habitat loss over four years,
   while the population of Bull-headed Shrikes was stable. The degree of
   philopatry was inconsistent with the population trends of the two
   shrikes. While Bull-headed Shrikes did not have habitat preferences in
   the study area, Brown Shrikes bred mainly in natural grasslands with
   shrubs. Since available habitat for Brown Shrikes has decreased rapidly
   in and near the study area, the philopatry of Brown Shrikes may result
   from a scarcity of habitat that inhibits dispersal. Bull-headed Shrikes
   may have a higher tendency to disperse because they are habitat
   generalists. With its more narrow requirements, the Brown Shrike appears
   to have suffered significantly from habitat loss, while the Bull-headed
   Shrike has not been adversely affected.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to attract wading birds to a specific location is an
   important tool for wading bird research. We examined the effectiveness
   of three commercially available decoy types in attracting free-ranging
   wading birds to a precise location. There was a statistically
   significant effect of decoy type on the abundance of wading birds.
   Wading birds were more attracted to sites with plastic flamingo and
   Tyvek(R) bag decoys than with Texas rag decoys or no decoys (control
   sites). The flamingo and Tyvek(R) bag decoys have a rigid
   three-dimensional shape, which may be a more important characteristic
   than the detailed features of a decoy in attracting wading birds. White
   wading birds showed a significant effect of decoy type on abundance,

Abstract = {{We studied the species composition and seasonality of the bird community

   carried out in natural grasslands with and without a history of cattle
   grazing ({''}mixed grassland{''} and ``sorgastral,{''} respectively). We
   counted birds using the strip-transect method. We recorded a total of 22
   bird species including only 12 grassland-dependent species. The more
   representative species of these grasslands were Chaco Pipit (Anthus
   chacoensis), Long-tailed Meadowlark (Sturnella loyca), and Grassland
   Sparrow (Ammodramus humeralis). Richness and abundance of birds were
   higher in mixed grasslands than in sorgastral in spring and summer, but
   not in winter. Inside habitats, richness and abundance were higher in
   spring and summer than in winter. We observed a seasonal change in guild
   dominance, with granivores dominant in winter, although bird density
   decreased during winter for all guilds. Despite the low richness
   recorded, the presence of certain rare species, such as the Chaco Pipit
   and the near threatened Greater Rhea (Rhea americana), add conservation
   value to west pampa grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{We studied seven mixed-species colonies of terns and skimmers on the
   Virginia barrier islands in 1990 and 1991 to determine the effect of
   gull predation on nesting success. We compared intensity of gull
   predation and other agents of egg or chick mortality between tern and
   skimmer colonies on islands that also contained nesting gulls and
   colonies on islands that lacked nesting gulls. Terns and skimmers
   fledged about 3\% of all eggs produced, with confirmed gull predation
   (27\%) and tidal flooding (21\%) accounting for the majority of nest
   failures. Gull-present colonies experienced significantly greater rates
   of disturbance from Herring and Great Black-backed gulls than did
   gull-absent colonies. Overall levels of gull predation were similar
   between gull-present and gull-absent colonies, likely due to the added
   impact of aerially foraging Laughing Gulls. Anecdotal evidence suggests
   that nest site competition with Herring and Great Black-backed gulls may
   have led to many terns and skimmers nesting in areas that were prone to
   frequent tidal flooding. In addition, floods may have indirectly
   prevented terns and skimmers from adequately protecting their surviving
   eggs and young, thus rendering flooded colonies more susceptible to gull
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus) wintering in the
   Imperial Valley of California in January 2001, and also recorded the
   types of crop fields used by plovers in this agricultural landscape. We
   tallied 4037 plovers in 36 flocks ranging in size from 4 to 596 birds.
   Plovers were more common on alfalfa and Bermudagrass fields than other
   field types. Further, most birds were on alfalfa fields that were
   currently being (or had recently been) grazed, primarily by domestic
   sheep. Plovers used Bermudagrass fields only after harvest and
   subsequent burning. Examination of Christmas Bird Count data from
   1950-2000 indicated that the Mountain Plover has abandoned its
   historical wintering areas on the coastal plains of California. Numbers
   in the Central Valley seem to have undergone recent declines also. We
   believe that the cultivated landscape of the Imperial Valley provides
   wintering habitats for about half of the global population of Mountain
   Plovers. We attribute the current importance of the Imperial Valley for
   Mountain Plovers to loss of native coastal and Central Valley habitats
   rather than to a behavioral switching of wintering areas through time.
   Future changes in specific cropping or management practices in the
   Imperial Valley will have a major impact on the conservation status of
   this species.}},

   methods (capture in high nets and playback of songs) on the Courish Spit

   Sedge Warblers in still air varied from 19 to 665 kin, with a mean of
   295 km. The high fuel loads of Sedge Warblers on departure and on
   arrival may be explained by the necessity for Scandinavian populations
   to cross the Baltic; the risk of drifting out to sea for birds migrating

Abstract = {{We studied molt and size variation in Whiskered Auklets collected at sea
   in August from the Aleutian Islands in 1992 and 1993. We evaluated size
   differences from external and skeletal measurements. Adults were molting
   extensively in August, indicating that molt began in July. Primaries 1-5
   had been completely replaced, while primaries 6-8 were in various stages
   of replacement, and primaries 9 and 10 were old in most birds. We also
   found that juveniles were not molting. This pattern is similar to other
   species of small auklets where breeding and molt in adults overlap, but
   juveniles do not molt until the following summer. This suggests that
   Whiskered Auklets are subjected to similar ecological constraints as
   other auklets. We provide the first skeletal measurements of Whiskered
   Auklets and some new external measurements. Results of statistical
   analyses indicate that there is no sexual dimorphism in adults. A small
   sample of juveniles suggests that they are similar in size to adults.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the status of Florida's threatened Crested Caracara
   (Caracara cheriway) population, knowledge of life history parameters and
   population dynamics is required. Using the program MARK, I estimated
   survival rates for adult and juvenile Crested Caracaras from breeding
   areas in southcentral Florida during the period February 1994 through
   March 2000. Annual adult survival probabilities estimated from
   resightings of banded individuals and derived using model averaging were
   0.876 for males and 0.906 for females. Results of modeling monthly
   juvenile caracara survival from radiotelemetry data identified
   differences in survival for two age groups: juveniles (up to age 3
   years) and adults (age >3 years). Using this age-effects model, monthly
   survival for juvenile caracaras was estimated to be 0.970, indicating an
   annual survival rate of 0.694 and an overall probability of 0.334 of an
   individual surviving to age 3, when it could potentially become a
   breeder. juvenile caracaras experienced periods of decreased
   survivorship beginning at two months after fledging, which coincides
   with the fledglings' independence, and about one year after fledging,
   when juveniles typically leave their natal breeding area. Along with
   protecting suitable nesting habitat to enhance survival and breeding of
   adults, conservation and management strategies for Florida's caracaras
   should focus on identifying and protecting areas where groups of
   individuals in the juvenile age class congregate. Such protection would
   enhance survival of these individuals, thus ensuring their continued
   recruitment into the breeding population.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the life history and reproduction of the
   Curl-crested Jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), despite its conspicuousness
   and endemic status, being restricted primarily to the central Cerrado
   biome of Brazil. From May 1999 to December 2000, we examined the sizes
   of home ranges and foraging and reproductive patterns in this species.
   Average group size was approximately 10 individuals, with average home
   ranges of 172 ha; during the reproductive period individuals in the
   group tended to stay within approximately 29 ha of active nests. These
   jays are dietary generalists, while the diversity of substrates and
   capture techniques employed showed high flexibility in resource
   utilization. The reproductive period was from September to March, and
   groups produced average clutch sizes of 5.7 eggs, but only 35\% of these
   hatched and only 25\% of the nests produced at least one fledgling.
   Predation was the chief cause of nesting failure, accounting for 63\% of
   nest loss. The occurrence of large groups year-round with several
   individuals providing parental care and evidence of just one female
   laying eggs suggest that the Curl-crested Jay is a cooperative breeder
   with a high degree of sociality, However, further study is necessary to
   exclude the possibility that more than one female is laying eggs in a
   single nest.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology, site fidelity, and dispersal of
   Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) from 1996 to 2000 in a
   fragmented landscape in western New York State. Ten fields (1.8-13.2 ha)
   contained territorial male Grasshopper Sparrows during the study; total
   territorial males in the study area varied between 31 and 19 birds. In
   1996, eight fields were occupied; five extinctions and two colonizations
   occurred between 1997-2000. Fields that suffered extinctions were
   smaller than fields in which subpopulations persisted or colonizations
   occurred. Adult return rates (0.33 vs. 0.16), nest success (0.59 vs.
   0.25) and average number of fledglings/female/year (2.3 vs. 1.3) tended
   to be higher in fields greater than or equal to8 ha. Estimates of X, the
   finite rate of increase, were 0.23 for small fields and 0.46 for large
   fields. Although sample sizes were small, our data suggest that return
   rates and productivity were greater in large than in small habitat
   patches. However, even the larger habitat patches in our study area
   appeared to function as population sinks, suggesting that the
   Grasshopper Sparrow population is unlikely to persist without
   immigration. Survival prospects for our study population are poor, given
   its demographic characteristics and the fragmented nature and continuing
   loss of grassland habitat. Our results suggest that conservation efforts
   in the Northeast should focus on protecting large patches of continuous
   grassland habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of time of season on the accuracy of species
   number estimation from point-count data collected at 28 oases from
   southern Tunisia. Each oasis was visited at the beginning of the
   breeding season and two months later, which allowed us to conduct counts
   on five points per oasis per visit. For each oasis, we considered the
   observed species number as the total number of species recorded during
   each visit, and we used a capture-recapture approach to estimate species
   number from patterns of presence and absence of species over the five
   points. We found that birds were more detectable at the beginning of the
   breeding season than two months later, and the observed species number
   showed a significant decrease between the two periods. However, when a
   capture-recapture approach accounting for heterogeneity in species
   detectability was used, similar estimates were obtained from data
   collected during both periods. Nonetheless, the estimates obtained at
   the beginning of the breeding season were more precise than those
   obtained later. Overall, our results illustrate once more the need of
   taking into account time of season as an important source of bias when
   attempting to determine species richness from count data, and stress the
   need for using probabilistic approaches in such an investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Subspecies of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) exhibit wide variation in
   body size across their range. To monitor harvest levels in the Pacific
   Flyway, biologists commonly use culmen length and plumage color to
   differentiate among subspecies on sympatric wintering grounds. Among the
   four large-bodied Pacific subspecies (B. c. parvipes, B. c.
   occidentalis, B. c. fulva, and B. c. moffitti), overlap in culmen length
   and subjectivity of visually assessing color results in
   misclassification and inaccurate harvest estimates. We examined the
   morphology of Pacific large-bodied Canada Geese to characterize body
   size variation among subspecies and provide more discriminatory measures
   for harvest assessments. We found that culmen length, one of the most
   commonly used field measures, overlapped widely among subspecies, and it
   had little support for inclusion in discriminatory models. Morphological
   measures with greater explanatory power included bill width at nail,
   bill width at base, head length, and mid wing. If culmen length and
   plumage color continue to be used to assess winter harvest, we recommend
   the addition of at least one sex-specific measurement to reduce levels
   of misclassification among subspecies. If an additional morphological
   measure is included, further evaluation on the wintering grounds should
   be conducted as this measure's effectiveness may vary depending upon
   observer bias, temporal and spatial variation in subspecies abundance,
   and the proportion of birds accurately sexed by cloacal examination.}},

Abstract = {{Male and female Rock Shags (Phalacrocorax magellanicus) are not
   obviously sexually dimorphic in plumage or size and are thus difficult

   DNA-based techniques for sexing adult Rock Shags. We found that the
   primer set 2550F/2718R (originally tested in three individuals of P
   carbo), with minor differences in the forward primer, provided a
   consistent and simple sexing method for Rock Shags. Moreover, we
   obtained three reliable discriminant functions for sexing adults from
   three different colony sites between 42degrees to 47degreesS in coastal
   Patagonia, Argentina. Discriminant analysis of five external characters
   of adult birds indicated that head, bill, and wing lengths were the most
   accurate variables for use in a discriminant function model, predicting
   the sex of 80-86\% of the birds. Males were significantly larger than
   females for all body measurements except for bill depth. Rock Shags
   showed less marked sexual dimorphism than other phalacrocoraciid
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Line transects based on distance sampling methodology were used to
   census nocturnal raptor species in three different primary lowland
   forest habitats in the Tambopata region, southeastren Peru. Density
   estimates were calculated for five owl species in these forest habitats.
   In general, species were more abundant in primary old floodplain or
   primary middle/upper floodplain forests than in primary seasonally
   flooded swamp forest. Density estimates were also higher than those
   calculated from traditional spot-mapping methods in other lowland forest
   sites in southeastern Peru and French Guiana. There was no significant
   difference in the number of individual owls recorded during nights with
   different cloud cover or during different phases of the moon. Problems
   of distance estimation at night and unfamiliarity with a range of
   vocalizations, particularly with Strix owls, may be overcome by
   conducting a practice period before surveys are undertaken, with
   transect routes and distance markers adequately set out. Walking
   transect routes during daylight hours in a practice period also helps to
   overcome concerns of observer safety.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{381-393}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Offshore censuses of birds are lacking for inland seas, such as the
   Laurentian Great Lakes, but may provide valuable information for
   managing species that are in conflict with human interests. Birds were
   counted along 31 established transects in four habitats in western Lake
   Erie: offshore of waterbird refuges, offshore of beaches with human
   development, on reefs and shoals, and in open water. A total of 161
   10-min counts were conducted between 24 April and I September 2000. The
   mean number of aquatic bird species/km(2) (species density) was greater
   offshore of refuges than on open water. For all habitats combined,
   species density increased over time. This was mainly due to the arrival
   of Bonaparte's Gulls (Larus philadelphia) and Great Black-backed Gulls
   (L. marinus), two fall and winter residents that do not breed in the
   study area, and increased use of open water and reefs and shoals by
   Herring Gulls (L. argentatus) and Ring-billed Gulls (L. delawarensis)
   after the nesting season. Species density was not strongly spatially
   autocorrelated, either for all species or for only those species that
   were floating on the water when recorded. Neither Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) nor Herring Gulls exhibited spatial
   autocorrelation. In contrast, Bonaparte's and Ring-billed gulls
   exhibited positive spatial autocorrelations. Unlike marine studies,
   species density was only weakly associated with water depth. This result
   was due mainly to Double-crested Cormorants, the only diving bird
   species that lived year-round in the area, which preferred reefs and
   shoals (depth 3-6 m) over open water ( greater than or equal to10 m).
   The results suggest that offshore habitat influences species density in
   this area during the breeding and immediate post-breeding seasons.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nest boxes by Vaux's Swifts (Chaetura vauxi) was investigated
   because of the loss of large-diameter hollow trees used for nesting in
   northwestern North America. Nest attempts and nest success were compared
   in nest boxes among three habitat types in northeastern Oregon. Air
   temperatures in the boxes were monitored to determine if boxes
   overheated and resulted in nestling mortality. Thirty of 103 nest boxes
   were used by nesting Vaux's Swifts for at least one year during
   1999-2002. Of 51 nest attempts, 53\% successfully fledged 1-6 young ((x)
   over bar = 3.5 nestlings). Over this 4-yr period, 47\% of the nests were
   in late-seral stage grand fir (Abies grandis) stands, 31\% were in
   harvested stands of grand fir, and 22\% were in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) stands. It appeared that temperature did not affect nest
   success in boxes because there were no significant differences in
   maximum and minimum temperatures between successful and unsuccessful
   nest attempts. Nest boxes provided alternative nest sites for Vaux's
   Swifts in habitats traditionally used by this species as well as in
   habitats that currently lack natural nest sites.}},

Abstract = {{Development of effective trapping techniques is important for

   trapped 50 Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus), 2258 Snowy Plovers (C
   alexandrinus), 38 Killdeers (C vociferus), and 64 Dunlins (Calidris
   alpina) in the western and southern United States. The trap was
   lightweight, making it easy to transport and set up. It was effective on
   unvegetated substrates at both coastal and inland sites and could be
   modified for a variety of habitats. Furthermore, this trap allowed
   researchers to target specific groups of birds including territorial
   individuals. Easy removal of birds from traps minimized handling time,

Abstract = {{The `Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis) is a monarch flycatcher endemic
   to the Hawaiian Islands. Both sexes have a two-year delay in plumage
   maturation, with distinct first-year and second-year subadult plumages.
   This study tested hypotheses for the evolution of delayed plumage
   maturation in `Elepaio by presenting adult males with models
   representing different ages and sexes in the breeding and nonbreeding
   seasons. The subadult plumages of `Elepaio appeared to serve as honest,
   graded signals of status that reduced aggression from dominant adults.
   Both first-year and second-year subadult male models were attacked less
   than adult male models, and aggression increased linearly with age of
   male models. Neither subadult plumage appeared to function in sexual
   mimicry or juvenile mimicry. Second-year male models were attacked more
   than adult female models; neither subadult plumage resembles adult
   plumage of the opposite sex. First-year male models, which are
   juvenile-like, were not attacked more than adult female models, but
   juvenile mimicry cannot account for the behavior toward second-year male
   models and is a less parsimonious explanation. Aggression toward models
   was much higher in the breeding season, and all models were treated
   similarly in the nonbreeding season, suggesting competition for mates
   has been the primary selective force shaping the evolution of the
   `Elepaio's plumage coloration. Models made from color photocopies can be
   a useful alternative to museum specimens in behavioral studies of rare
   species or those in which damage to specimens during model presentation
   would occur.}},

Abstract = {{We used solar-powered time-lapse video photography to document nesting
   Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) food habits in central West Greenland from
   May to July in 2000 and 2001. We collected 2677.25 h of videotape from
   three nests, representing 94, 87, and 49\% of the nestling period at
   each nest. The video recorded 921 deliveries of 832 prey items. We
   placed 95\% of the items into prey categories. The image quality was
   good but did not reveal enough detail to identify most passerines to
   species. We found no evidence that Gyrfalcons were negatively affected
   by the video system after the initial camera set-up. The video system
   experienced some mechanical problems but proved reliable. The system
   likely can be used to effectively document the food habits and nesting
   behavior of other birds, especially those delivering large prey to a
   nest or other frequently used site.}},

Abstract = {{Date of clutch initiation and mean clutch size for an alpine population
   of American Pipits (Anthus rubescens) in northern Wyoming varied
   significantly among seven years sampled during 1963-1995. Because
   American Pipits are obligate ground-nesters in an environment devoid of
   trees, I examined the hypothesis that spring snow conditions cause the
   annual variation in mean laying date and resulting clutch size. Mean
   clutch size was highly correlated with mean laying date, and both traits
   were highly correlated with the snow water equivalent (SWE) on I May.
   Reduced SWE resulted in earlier onset of egg laying and indirectly in
   increased clutch size. Trend analyses for 1961-2002 showed an 18\%
   decline in I May SWE and an earlier date of snowmelt by 7 d, indicating
   that an earlier onset of egg laying by about 5 d may have occurred over
   the same period, with a corresponding increase in mean clutch size of
   0.2 eggs. This result supports the global pattern for various bird
   species of earlier onset of nesting during the last few decades. Annual
   laying date and clutch size of American Pipits appear to respond
   predictably to short-term (annual) changes in spring snow conditions at
   this high-elevation location and may prove useful for projecting
   reproductive responses of alpine birds to changing trends in climate.}},

Abstract = {{We provide the first description of lek mating behavior in the

   observation of unmarked birds at a lek in the Paria Peninsula of
   Venezuela. A minimum of six presumed males displayed within an area of
   2835 m(2). Males displayed from an average of 2.5 perches per male
   located 1.10-2.25 in above ground on understory plant stems 2.5-4.0 cm
   thick. While present within the lek, hermits spent 75.9\% of their time
   perched singing, 20.0\% perched silent, 1.0\% perched preening, 0.2\%
   flying alone, 2.0\% flying with a conspecific (in a chase), and 0.9\%
   fighting with a conspecific. Lekking activity appeared to be most
   intense in the early morning and late afternoon, and least intense
   during mid-morning. The song comprised a squeaky phrase of about five
   syllables delivered by displaying males at an average of 27.7 songs
   (maximum of 33) per min. The behavioral displays resembled those of
   other lekking species of Phaethornis.}},

Abstract = {{Curassows are among the most threatened Neotropical birds, so reliable
   methods for estimating their abundance are needed to discern
   distribution patterns and manage populations. Based on the assumptions
   that the distance to booming curassows cannot be determined reliably and
   that curassow calling is unpredictable, it has been suggested that
   curassow abundance should be estimated only through surveys using visual
   cues. Based on line-transect surveys of Great Curassows (Crax rubra)
   conducted in a lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica, we show that
   distance to booming curassows can be measured accurately in the field.
   We also show that line-transect aural surveys sample curassows over
   large areas across all forest vertical strata and provide precise
   estimates of their abundance, but are biased towards detecting males. In
   contrast, line-transect visual surveys sample only small areas of forest
   understory and are imprecise, but appear not to be biased towards any
   sex or age class. We argue that the assumption that curassow calling is
   unpredictable is not well supported, and we recommend the use of surveys
   using aural cues to estimate curassow abundance efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Fledging success is widely used as an index of reproductive success in
   avian studies, but survival of young after fledging is rarely estimated.
   In this study, I used radio telemetry to measure rates and causes of
   mortality of 63 Black-fronted Terns (Sterna albostriata) in the
   immediate post-fledging period on the Ohau River, South Island, New
   Zealand, in 1998-2000. juvenile survival for four weeks after fledging
   was 0.795. Mean daily survival increased from 0.972 in the first week
   after fledging to 0.995 in the second week and 1.00 for the third and
   fourth weeks. Introduced predators such as feral cats (Felis catus) and
   Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) were responsible for a minimum of nine
   out of 12 deaths, and all except one death occurred at the natal colony
   prior to dispersal. Larger, heavier juveniles that fledged at a younger
   age tended to have higher survival after fledging, but survival could
   not be accurately predicted based on measurements of growth. These
   results indicate that the post-fledging period can be an important
   period for mortality in young birds, and that survival until dispersal
   from the natal colony is the best measure of Black-fronted Tern
   reproductive success currently available.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Ducks are closely
   related and nest in similar habitats, the two species have inverse
   population trends. To evaluate the hypothesis that the difference in
   trends could be related to differences in reproduction, we compared
   nesting success of sympatric Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Ducks in
   parkland habitat near Erickson, Manitoba. Data supported a model that
   allowed nest survival to differ by species more strongly than a model
   that did not. Daily survival rate of Lesser Scaup nests (0.941) was
   lower than that of Ring-necked Ducks (0.969). All Ring-necked Ducks
   nested over water, but only 57\% of Lesser Scaup nested over water.
   Further, we found some evidence that nest survival was better over water
   than in upland locations. If our observed pattern of differential
   nesting success between species holds across broader areas, it may
   explain why Ring-necked Ducks are increasing across North America while
   Lesser Scaup populations are declining.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes annual variation in abundance and population status
   of non-breeding migratory shorebirds in flooding pampa grasslands of
   Argentina. We studied two Nearctic species, the American Golden-Plover
   (Pluvialis dominica) and the Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites
   subruficollis), and two Patagonian species, the Tawny-throated Dotterel
   (Oreopholus ruficollis) and the Rufous-chested Dotterel (Chdradrius
   modestus), at Medaland Ranch in the Villa Gesell District of Buenos
   Aires Province, Argentina. Counts were made every 15 d between March
   1996 and January 2000. Numbers of Rufous-chested Dotterels were
   generally highest toward the end of winter (July-September) indicating
   that the species uses this area as a stopover site. Tawny-throated
   Dotterels were present throughout the entire winter period
   (April-September). The Nearctic species spent the austral spring-summer
   months at Medaland (September-February) before returning to their
   breeding grounds in North America. Comparison of our numbers to historic
   counts indicates declines of Buff-breasted Sandpipers (especially during
   the past 25 yr) and American Golden-Plovers throughout the past century.
   Medaland Ranch is clearly an important wintering site for these four
   migratory shorebirds. The departure of Patagonian species and the
   arrival of Nearctic species always occurred within a short period of
   time (days), but the time factor between departure of Nearctic and
   arrival of Patagonian species was measured in months. Our observations
   tend to support the hypothesis that the migratory pattern of Patagonian
   shorebirds results from avoiding competition with Nearctic shorebirds.}},

   egg types with the predation rates on nests of the Brown-and-yellow
   Marshbird (Pseudoleistes virescens), a Neotropical passerine common in
   the same area, in Argentina. We used deserted natural nests as
   experimental nests, baited with either Japanese Quail (Coturnix
   coturnix) or Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) eggs. Each
   experimental nest was baited with one natural and one paraffin-filled
   egg. Experimental nests baited with quail eggs suffered lower predation
   and egg losses than those baited with cowbird eggs. The main cause of
   egg loss and nest mortality in ``cowbird nests{''} was pecking behavior
   of cowbirds. However, when we removed the effect of cowbirds,
   differences still held. In this area, the Shiny Cowbird is common and is
   the main cause of reduced breeding success of several host species.
   ``Quail nests{''} had higher nest and egg survival than active
   Brown-and-yellow Marshbird nests. In contrast, ``cowbird nests{''} and
   active Brown-and-yellow Marshbird nests had similar nest and egg
   survival. Experimental nests baited with natural passerine eggs such as
   those of Shiny Cowbirds seem to approximate the natural nest and egg
   predation risk for passerines in our study area.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether surgically-implanted radio transmitters with
   percutaneous antennas affected behavior of Lesser Canada Geese (Branta
   canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska. We implanted either a 26-g
   VHF radio transmitter or a larger VHF radio that was the same mass (35
   g) and shape as a satellite transmitter in the coelom of adult females
   captured during molt in 2000. A control group of females was marked with
   leg bands. We simultaneously observed behavior of radio-marked and
   control females from 4-62 d following capture. We observed no
   differences in the proportion of time birds in different treatments
   allocated among grazing, resting, comfort, walking, and alert behavior.
   Females in different treatments spent a similar proportion of time in
   the water. Implantation of radio transmitters did not affect the
   frequency of agonistic interactions. We conclude that coelomic radio
   transmitters with percutaneous antennas had minimal effects on the
   behavior of Canada Geese.}},

   Cuckoo were laid between 06:36 and 11:57 CST Conspecific parasitism was
   recorded at one nest in which two eggs were laid on the same day, at
   09:02 and 11:57; the second egg was likely the parasite's. Only one
   laying interval, of about 48 h, was determined accurately. There seems
   to be no best time for laying in parasitic cuckoos, because it may be

Abstract = {{We compared the effectiveness and reliability of mechanically
   egg-triggered set-cameras and time-lapse video cameras in identifying
   nest predators at active Dusky Flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) nests
   in Siskiyou County, California. We monitored 72 active flycatcher nests
   using camera systems from 1998 to 2000. Nest abandonment, hatching
   success, and daily survival rate did not differ between camera systems.
   Set-cameras were less reliable than video systems in successfully
   recording predation events (45\% versus 95\%). The nest predator
   assemblage between camera types differed significantly with more avian
   predators (primarily raptors) recorded at video-monitored nests. This
   may have been due to the failure of hawks and owls to take the trigger
   egg at set-camera nests during the nestling stage. We did not find a
   strong association between the condition of the nest (disturbed or
   undisturbed) after the predation event and the identity of the predator
   (mammalian or avian). We also documented disruption of the nest by
   visitors other than the original predator. These observations suggest
   that identification of nest predators based on nest remains can be
   highly inaccurate. We recommend the use of videography for accurate
   identification of nest predators. Results from studies identifying
   predators with egg-triggered cameras should limit conclusions to the
   incubation stage.}},

Abstract = {{Tartar emetic is frequently used to force regurgitation in birds,
   allowing the study of diet while minimizing mortality. However, the
   responsiveness to the emetic in terms of regurgitation and mortality
   rates has been shown to be highly species-specific. A total of 369
   individuals (44 species) present in an area of Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   received the tartar emetic during 410 treatment events. These birds were
   mainly insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. Regurgitation occurred
   in 70\% of the treatments, with an overall pre-release mortality of
   10\%. Average latency time was 20 min, and it was not correlated with
   average species body mass. Incidence of regurgitation was lower and
   mortality was higher in the first hours of the day. Incidence of
   regurgitation varied with feeding guild, taxonomic family, and body mass
   classes in univariate tests, but only with guild after the effects of
   family and body mass had been controlled for. Incidence of mortality was
   affected by family. Responsiveness did not vary between males and
   females. Mortality occurred more frequently among individuals that
   failed to regurgitate than among individuals that did regurgitate (85\%
   vs. 15\% of mortality events). Recapture rates were lower among treated
   individuals than among untreated individuals (10 vs. 13\%), and lower
   among treated individuals that failed to regurgitate than among those
   that did regurgitate (8 vs. 11\%), but these differences were not
   statistically significant. Treated and untreated birds presented
   statistically similar displacement rates between transects (32 vs.
   42\%). Our recommendation is that the tartar emetic should be used with
   caution, and alternative methods should be favored for those species
   presenting unsatisfactory responses to the tartar emetic. We also
   recommend that the use of this substance should be avoided in the first
   hours of the day, when the birds had little time to forage.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of aerial estimates of avian aggregation sizes is variable
   across studies, and the relative importance of techniques and
   inter-observer error to this variation are poorly understood. Using a
   scaled physical model of a wading bird colony, we examined accuracy and
   variation in observer counts of simulated large numbers (200-6000) of
   densely nesting birds in vegetated situations. Observer estimates
   averaged 29\% less than true numbers (under- and overestimates averaged
   together), and the mean absolute value of observer errors was 49\% of
   true values. We found no effects of the size of the aggregation, the
   experience of the observer, the size of the previous aggregations
   surveyed by observers, the use of corrective lenses, or fatigue on
   degree of individual error. Over- and underestimates by individuals did
   not tend to cancel out in estimates by individuals of a ``population{''}
   of colonies. Photographic counts of the same trials were significantly
   more accurate than observer estimates. We suggest that man), studies
   using estimates of large numbers of birds may be confounded by similar
   errors. We urge that researchers use caution in interpreting the results
   of past surveys and develop ways to minimize, measure, and correct for
   visual estimation error within individuals and among observers.}},

   oak-lime-hornbeam stands of the Bialowieza Forest, eastern Poland, from

   clutch size, partial clutch losses, partial brood losses, or number of
   offspring fledged between pairs breeding in natural cavities and nest
   boxes; however, predation rates were significantly greater in natural
   cavities. Predation rates may be higher in natural cavities because,
   under natural conditions like that of the Bialowieza Forest, predators
   may lack experience with artificial nest sites. These results indicate
   that studies using box-nesting bird populations should be regarded with

Abstract = {{Disturbance from human recreation may impact vulnerable life stages of
   beach-nesting plovers (Charadrius spp.). Although human recreation may
   decrease hatching success of Snowy Plovers (C alexandrinus), we are
   unaware of any studies indicating an impact on chick survival. We tested
   whether the rate of chick loss in a breeding population of Snowy Plovers
   was lower on weekdays than on weekends and holidays, when beach
   visitation increases in most coastal areas. We used data collected on
   chick survival and the timing of chick loss in 1999 and 2000 at Point
   Reyes National Seashore, California. Observed weekend and holiday chick
   loss was 72\% greater than expected in 1999 and 69\% greater than
   expected in 2000. This suggests that increased human recreation on Point
   Reyes beaches over weekends and holidays negatively affected Snowy
   Plover chick survival.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies and population surveys sometimes require information
   on the position of individuals. Because many birds are more audible than
   visible, we tested the potential of acoustic triangulation for locating
   Great Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) within extensive reed marshes in the
   Camargue, France. During the breeding season, and predominantly at dawn,
   male bitterns produce a series of loud calls (booms). In the field, the
   direction of booming was estimated with a bearing compass by an observer
   walking along a linear path at the reedbed edge, taking enough
   measurements to cover a 90degrees wide angle between the first and last
   bearing. We used a probability model with an Andrews estimator to locate
   each bittern based on the intersection point of the bearings taken in
   the field. Bearing error was estimated by comparing these bearings with
   those derived from the real or estimated bird position. In a first
   experiment, we identified the factors influencing the variation in
   bearing error using six observers, 237 directional bearings, and 19
   bitterns. In a second experiment, we quantified the bearing accuracy
   under optimal conditions based on three observers using 47 directional
   bearings to locate a bittern of known position. There was no observer
   effect, but wind speed above 10 km/h, occurrence of poor booms, and
   bittern distance under 200 m significantly increased bearing error.
   Bitterns calling normally under windless conditions could be located
   with a mean bearing accuracy of +/- 13.6degrees. Location accuracy
   depended primarily on the bird distance and number of bearing angles. We
   propose an optimal bearing effort to locate booming males in large
   reedbeds with an accuracy of a 40-m radius irrespective of the bittern
   distance. This protocol can be applied to other bird species once the
   bearing accuracy corresponding to their call and habitat has been
   estimated. Acoustic triangulation appears to be a useful, non-invasive,
   technique for locating bitterns and other bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Avian field studies commonly employ colored leg bands to follow
   individual birds without recapturing them. However, this technique is
   subject to several types of reporting errors. In a laboratory setting
   under ideal conditions, we marked model birds with colored band
   combinations to examine resighting rates and errors made by trained and
   untrained observers. We varied both the time of exposure and the number
   of birds presented to observers in a series of replicate trials. We
   found large variation in the number of incorrectly recorded combinations
   among both trained and untrained observers. The mean error rate for
   trained observers was 5\%, and for untrained observers was 16\%. In both
   groups, error rates significantly increased when observers were exposed
   to more birds or observation intervals were short. The most common type
   of error involved switching band combinations on left and right legs. In
   some cases incorrectly recorded combinations matched actual combinations
   used on other birds. We also found that resighting probabilities
   depended on the particular colors used. Because this study was performed
   under indoor lighting conditions and at a relatively close distance (to
   mimic conditions under which birds are viewed at nearby feeders), we
   suggest that the error rates we observed likely represent low estimates
   and that error rates under field conditions will be higher.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of varying census duration on line transect
   estimates of winter bird abundance and species richness in second-growth
   coastal western hemlock forest fragments in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Three treatments of census duration (12 min, 18 min and 24 min) were
   compared on 200 m-long transects at three study sites over three
   fortnights in a replicated latin square experimental design. Overall,
   census duration affected the number of individual birds and bird species
   detected. The number of individual birds detected increased
   significantly with census duration from 12 min to 18 min but not from 18
   min to 24 min. The number of bird species detected also increased with
   census duration, although the increase was significant only between 12
   min and 24 min. The results suggest that for winter bird counts in
   coastal western hemlock forest, a census duration of 18 min for a 200
   m-long transect is most efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Feather growth bar widths have become a standard index of nutritional
   condition in ornithological research. Traditional techniques of
   measuring these bars are difficult and slow because the bars are often
   hard to see. We present a fast and repeatable method of visualizing and
   measuring growth bars using a gel documentation system from
   Alpha-Innotech Corporation. This system takes digital photos of objects
   in a low light chamber. These photos can then be enhanced and measured
   on a computer. We show that this system can be used to quickly obtain
   repeatable measurements of growth bars that are highly correlated with
   those obtained using traditional methods. The high repeatability and low
   inter-observer variability of our results also validates more
   traditional methods of ptilochronology.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated nasal discs and colored leg bands for Harlequin Ducks
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) wintering in the Strait of Georgia, British
   Columbia, by comparing marker visibility and life span, and determining
   effects of nasal discs on behavior and pairing. Proportions resighted
   and frequency of sightings were higher for individuals marked with nasal
   discs than for those marked only with leg bands. Nasal disc loss
   followed a logistic function that predicted 50\% loss by 396 d. Due to
   wear of leg bands, number of sightings per individual decreased with leg
   band age following a cubic function. We detected no effects of nasal
   discs on time spent in various behaviors, timing of pairing, or female
   pairing success. However, males with nasal discs had lower pairing
   success and females with nasal discs were less likely to reunite with
   previous mates. We speculate that the effect of nasal discs on male
   pairing success may be due to a male-biased sex ratio and sexual
   selection on male appearance. Leg band wear should be considered for
   demographic models because its effects can violate assumptions and bias
   sighting and survival estimates.}},

   in a baseline survey of the same area in 1986. The probability of
   detecting rails at sample points declined from 36\% to 27\% between
   surveys. An invasive woody plant, Cinchona succirubra, was not detected
   in 1986 yet was present at nearly three-fourths of survey points in 2000
   and was avoided by rails in 2000. We recommend that future research and

Abstract = {{From March 1999 to August 2000, we used mist-netting, point counts, and
   radio-tracking to study habitat use, area requirements, and breeding of
   the Ivory-billed Woodcreeper Xiphorhynchus flavigaster in the tropical
   deciduous and semi-deciduous forest (arroyo forest) of the
   Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, western Mexico. The Ivory-billed
   Woodcreeper was a common, year-round resident. Breeding commenced at the
   end of the dry season (May) and continued during the rainy season
   through August. Our observations suggested that only the female builds
   the nest, incubates, and feeds nestlings. Ivory-billed Woodcreepers
   commonly foraged alone, but sometimes joined mixed-species flocks that
   passed through their territories, occasionally following army ant
   swarms. Home-range size varied from 6-36 ha, although most birds' home
   range was 15 ha or less. We did not find differences in home range size
   or mobility between the dry and rainy seasons, and we did not find a
   correlation between the size of the home range and the extent of
   semi-deciduous forest it included. We did not find evidence that
   suggested a greater use of semi-deciduous forest than of dry deciduous
   forest. We hypothesize that foraging habits and low competition could
   explain the lack of selection for semi-deciduous forest and the strong
   site fidelity exhibited by members of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting habitat of the Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris) is not
   well studied in the southeastern United States. We documented Clapper
   Rail nest characteristics and surrounding habitats near Brunswick on the
   Georgia coast. Of 159 nests found, only 29 were active. Although some
   nests may have been abandoned or never used, many could have been
   depreciated. Nests were constructed farther away from tidal influences
   than in those populations studied in the mid-Atlantic region of the
   United States. Clapper Rails also tended to nest near tidal pools as
   frequently as tidal creeks, contrasting with other Atlantic coast
   studies. The greater tidal amplitude of Brunswick as compared to the
   mid-Atlantic coast may explain this finding. Tidal-creek nests were
   found farther away from, and were associated with taller vegetation near
   the banks of, a water source than tidal-pool nests. While nest placement
   differed based on habitat characteristics in this study, nest-structure
   morphometrics were similar between tidal-creek and tidal-pool habitats
   and were consistent with those found in other regions of the country.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the food of nestling Rusty-margined (Myozetetes cayanensis)
   and Social flycatchers (M similis) in 1998 and 1999 at Barro Colorado
   Island, Panama. Food samples were taken from nestlings by fecal analysis
   and the neck-collar method. In both species most food items were
   beetles, winged ants, dragonflies, spiders, and seeds of Miconia spp.
   Water animals (mainly backswimmers, freshwater snails, and dragonfly
   larvae) constituted 7.8\%-13.5\% of animal prey. The nestlings of the
   Social Flycatcher received significantly more flying insects, while the
   proportion of fruits and seeds was significantly higher in the diet of
   Rusty-margined Flycatcher nestlings. Length of animal prey varied from
   4-25 mm in the Rusty-margined Flycatcher and 2-50 mm in the Social
   Flycatcher, and the length of fruits and seeds were 4-11 mm and 2-19 mm,
   respectively. The average length of animal food was larger in the
   Rusty-margined Flycatcher despite its slightly smaller size. The number
   of broods with nestlings or fledglings present in the study area was
   positively correlated with the abundance of fruits in the Social
   Flycatcher.}},

Abstract = {{Male and female Stripe-backed Wrens (Campylorhynchus nuchalis) have
   repertoires of learned, stereotyped calls that are specific to same-sex
   relatives in cooperatively breeding family groups. Consequently, they
   are potential cues for recognizing group membership and sex during
   social interactions. Here I describe the use of these calls for social
   communication in this species. Males call much more frequently than
   females within a group's territory; and dominant birds call more often
   than subordinates. In playback experiments, males responded to their
   own-group calls by producing matching call types, and called at
   relatively high rates following simulated territorial intrusions by
   neighboring birds. These vocalizations appear to function primarily in
   maintaining social bonds within a group and in recognizing group
   identity during interactions with other groups.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the distribution and relative abundance of resident and
   Nearctic-breeding, long-distance migrant grassland bird species in
   Cordoba province, Argentina. We sampled montane and lowland sites to
   determine if altitudinal differences might affect the grassland birds
   found there. We recorded a total of 48 grassland bird species; 38
   species were recorded in the montane region and 42 species were observed
   on the lowland sites. Darwin's Nothura (Nothura darwinii) and
   Long-tailed Meadowlarks (Sturnella loyca) were restricted to the montane
   region. Field Flickers (Colaptes campestris) were more common in the
   montane region whereas Chimango Caracaras (Milvago chimango), Southern
   Lapwings (Vanellus chilensis), and Fork-tailed Flycatchers (Tyrannus
   savanna) were more common on the lowland sites. Short-billed Pipits
   (Anthus furcatus), Yellowish Pipits (A. lutescens), and Chaco Pipits (A.
   chacoensis) only occurred in the lowlands. We found that Swainson's
   Hawks (Buteo swainsoni) and Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda)
   wintered in scattered flocks in the lowlands of east and south Cordoba
   but that these two species did not occur in the montane grasslands. We
   did not find Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) in Cordoba. The only
   globally threatened species we observed was the Andean Condor (Vultur
   gryphus), which was recorded twice in the highlands. In general, Cordoba
   province is an important region for grassland birds, especially
   Nearctic-breeding migrants, but this area no longer supports globally
   threatened species other than the Andean Condor. Intensification of
   agricultural practices and insecticide application to control insect
   pests constitute the primary threats to grassland birds in this region.}},

Abstract = {{We lured White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) to trap sites with decoy plastic
   flamingos and captured them with a rocket net or mist nets. Our ability
   to attract ibises to a site (and consequently our capture success) was
   affected by vegetation height and water depth but not by decoy numbers
   or their arrangement. Both the rocket net (37 ibises) and mist nets (97
   ibises) caught birds. The number of birds captured per day was the same
   for both methods, but the rocket net trap captured more birds per set
   than did mist nets. Because mist nets were easy to reset we captured 1-2
   birds per set multiple times in one day with mist nets. We preferred
   mist nets over rocket net traps because mist nets allowed for shorter
   bird processing times, greater case of set up, and fewer safety
   considerations for transport and operation of the trap. Also, rocket
   nets required more equipment and expense. Although we discouraged other
   species from landing at a trap site, there was evidence that these
   techniques may also be useful for capturing other wading birds.}},

Abstract = {{Recording flight calls of migrating birds with one or more microphones
   provides information on identity of some birds aloft over each
   microphone and on the time course of their migration, or at least their
   calling. Doppler surveillance radar observations, on the other hand,
   provide information on the numbers and sizes of flying animals aloft
   over a wide area and on speeds, directions of travel, and height in
   favorable circumstances. Comparison of calls of Dickcissels (Spiza
   americana) from sound recording stations across south Texas in spring
   with images from the KBRO NEXRAD (WSR-88D) radar operated by the
   National Weather Service showed a surprising correspondence between the
   two kinds of data, both temporally over the course of a night and
   geographically across about 115 km. Highly significant correlations
   between call rates and radar reflectivity were obtained for seven sound
   recording stations but nor for two other stations that were too distant
   for the radar to receive echoes froth birds migrating at the normal
   heights fur passerines.}},

Abstract = {{The number of visits parents make to their nest during chick rearing is
   a commonly used measure of the amount of food delivered to nestlings and
   an index of the quality of parental care. Use of the number of visits
   for these purposes assumes that parents feed nestlings when they visit
   and that there are no systematic differences in the amount of food
   delivered on each visit. These assumptions were tested in Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding in nest boxes near Ithaca, New York.
   Video observations of parents inside their nest boxes showed that
   parents feed nestlings on 95-98\% of visits to the nest. An average
   visit delivered 18.1 insects with a total dry mass of 24.1 mg, usually
   to a single nestling. Although females visited more frequently, the load
   they carried on each visit was not different than that carried by males.
   Load size did not differ with nestling age, brood size or the date of
   the feeding. Overall, there were few systematic differences in load size
   among nests. Therefore, the number of visits to the nest is a good
   measure of food delivery and parental care in Tree Swallows.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations in occurrence of the Blue-and-yellow (Ara ararauna),
   Red-and-green (A. chloroptera), and Scarlet (A. macao) Macaw were
   evaluated in the floodplain rainforest of the Manu Biosphere Reserve,
   southeast Peru. One-hour surveys of macaws were conducted while
   traveling along the Rio Manu in a motorized canoe during both the dry
   and rainy season. There was a significant three-fold decline in the
   number of macaws encountered during the dry season compared to the rainy
   season. Encounter rates also varied significantly among macaw species,
   and may be due to behavioral characteristics or habitat preferences of
   species. Rapid or short-term surveys used to establish trade quotas and
   the status of species may be susceptible to biases and inaccuracies
   resulting from seasonal variations and behavioral characteristics of
   psittacine species.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-32}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were banded as nestlings, migrants,
   wintering birds, and resident breeders in three states of the U.S. Rocky
   Mountain West between June 1973 and January 1999. To January 2000, 6.2\%
   of 325 eagles banded had been encountered as dead or injured birds or
   live captures. Median age of all encounters was 2.25 yr. Sex ratio of
   Golden Eagles encountered was not different from sex ratio at banding.
   Eagles banded as migrants were encountered less frequently than those
   banded as nestlings, residents, or wintering eagles. Cumulative
   exponential distribution analysis of recoveries (dead eagles) by age
   indicated 50\% of banded eagles were dead by 2 yr, 7 mo, 75\% by age 5
   yr, 1 me, and 95\% by 11 yr, 1 mo, with a maximum predicted age of 33
   yr, 10 mo. Distance from banding to encounter site was <90 km for 90\%
   of encounters, and all encounters of eagles banded as nestlings were
   within 200 km of their natal nest. Mean vector bearing of all encounters
   was 92.95degrees. Rayleigh tests for uniformity indicated encounters
   showed no directional bias, but only 22\% of all encounters were
   westward. No encounters occurred on the slope of the Continental Divide
   opposite from banding. The largest proportion (40\%) of Golden Eagles
   encountered died of unknown causes, and eagles less than one-year old
   may suffer the highest mortality rate. Considering the minimal
   contribution of recent nestling banding to the understanding of Golden
   Eagle demography and natural history, conservation and management of the
   species may be better served by focusing on more productive methods of
   research (color-marking, radio-tagging) rather than simply banding
   nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) are small, partially migrant
   shorebirds that are broadly distributed across North America. Snowy
   Plover distribution west of the Rocky Mountains has been well described.
   However, distribution and abundance east of the Rocky Mountains has not
   received much attention despite current status and ESA listing concerns
   for Snowy Plovers in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.
   Thus, a first step in developing a monitoring program for Snowy Plovers
   is to understand the species' distribution. We summarize information on
   distribution and abundance of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United
   States, Caribbean, and Bahamas. Breeding and winter distribution maps
   for the continental United States were generated from a database of 3563
   records from 388 sites in continental North America constructed from
   International Shorebird Survey (ISS), Christmas Bird Count (CBC),
   unpublished field data, and published accounts. Comparison of maximum
   counts per site (1980-present) indicated the number of breeding Snowy
   Plovers was greatest in Kansas and Oklahoma, while the greatest number
   of wintering birds occurred in the Laguna Madre of Texas and Mexico.
   Snowy Plovers concentrate at sites in Oklahoma and Texas during
   migration, with higher concentrations on the upper Texas coast in spring
   compared to fall migration. Data regarding historic abundance and trends
   are limited but suggest that Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States
   may have experienced regional population declines and may have suffered
   a range contraction in Texas. Serious concerns about the conservation
   status of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States, the Caribbean, and
   the Bahamas indicate an immediate need for systematic surveys and
   up-to-date population estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the results of point-count and mist-net surveys during the
   breeding and post-breeding seasons in four Missouri Ozark habitats:
   mature upland forest, mature riparian forest, 9- to 10-yr-old upland
   forest and 3- to 4-yr-old upland forest created by clearcutting. We
   determined whether differences in abundance estimates among habitats or
   between breeding and post-breeding seasons varied with survey method
   (i.e., habitat X method, season X method, or habitat X season X method
   interaction effects). The habitat X method interaction was significant
   for 13 of 16 species. The general pattern was for canopy or sub-canopy
   species to be detected by point counts more often in the mature-forest
   habitats, and to be detected by mist nets more often in the young-forest
   habitats. The season X method interaction was significant for 6 species
   largely because there was a greater decrease from breeding to post
   breeding season in mist-net captures than point-count detections. Two
   species had a significant habitat X season X method interaction.
   Differences in the patterns in abundance among habitats and between
   seasons, by survey method, are indicative of bias in the survey methods.
   Individuals planning bird surveys should recognize these biases and
   select the method that best samples the segment of the community they
   are surveying and that is least likely to confound treatment effects.
   Often this may require the use of multiple survey methods.}},

Abstract = {{The Bridled White-eve is a little known species endemic to the Mariana
   Islands in die tropical Pacific. Based on observations of social
   behavior and on movements of color-banded individuals, I evaluated which
   of four flocking strategies the Bridled White-eye appeared to use: (1)
   group territoriality, (2) permanent membership flocks. (3)
   site-dependent flocks, and (4) temporary flocks. Banded birds declined
   in frequency of occurrence from a single banding site and exhibited no
   clear defense of territorial boundaries. Many banded birds remained in
   the study area for up to 14.5 mo. Small groups of at least three birds
   were family groups, although larger groups of ca. 50 birds also foraged
   together and then dispersed into smaller flocks. Plotted resightings of
   individual banded birds suggested that home ranges of individuals were
   overlapping. These observations led to the conclusion that the Bridled
   White-eye exhibited flocking characteristics intermediate between
   permanent membership and site-dependent flocks.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the cohesion of mixed species flocks relies
   heavily on conspicuous species that act as an attractive nucleus for
   other birds. I evaluated the role of the White-flanked Antwren as a
   nuclear species in mixed-species flocks of gallery, forests of eastern
   Colombia, and tested experimentally the hypothesis that the conspicuous
   wing-flashes of males contribute to interspecific cohesion. Although
   most of the species present in my study site showed a high propensity to
   flock heteroespecifically, interspecific associations of the
   White-flanked Antwren tended to be short. The white flanks of male
   White-flanked Antwrens were not critical for maintaining a particular
   number of species inside the flocks, for spacing out the individuals in
   the interspecific groups, or for prolonging the duration of the
   inter-specific associations. The wing-flashes of the White-flanked
   Antwren provide an example of how assumptions about nuclear roles in
   species with conspicuous traits may lead to wrong conclusions about the
   dynamics of mixed-species flocking. My results suggest that although
   this antwren may be important for recruiting new members in forest
   flocks, it does not promote the maintenance of those associations.}},

Abstract = {{Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) are responsible for most eases of
   usurpation of nests of Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus). However,
   little is known about how both species interact during reproduction. We
   studied territorial behaviour during the breeding season in four Bearded
   Vulture pairs in the eastern Pyrenees of northeastern Spain. Frequency
   of agonistic behavior was positively correlated with Griffon Vulture
   colony size. However, no significantly higher frequency of aggressive
   interactions was found that suggested actual competition for nest sites
   between these species. Nonetheless, Bearded Vulture pairs maintained a
   continuous defence of tire area immediately surrounding their nests
   throughout the breeding season. Our data suggest that the Bearded
   Vulture's territorial behavior was more closely associated with defence
   of breeding space than with specific defence of actual nest sites.}},

Abstract = {{We observed foraging behavior and success of gulls (Larus spp.) at
   spawning runs of eulachon (Thaleichthyes pacificus, Osmeridae) in
   Berners Bay, Alaska, in spring 1996-1998. Adults foraged more
   effectively (greater than or equal to56\% of dives were successful) than
   immatures (less than or equal to56\%) when diving for fish, but there
   was little difference in the effectiveness of piracy (less than or equal
   to 23\% success for all gull species and age classes). The hypothesis
   that larger birds would be better pirates and less likely to lose prey
   to pirates was not well supported, although smaller species seldom
   attacked larger ones. Age classes less successful at foraging were more
   likely to act as pirates, but this relationship did not hold among
   species or between years. The frequency of piracy attempts was
   positively correlated with the availability of fish captured by other
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{We examined predation rates on natural and artificial Common Wood-Pigeon
   (Columba palumbus) nests with camouflaged cameras, with uncamouflaged
   cameras, and without cameras in Villatobas, Central Spain. Total daily
   nest survival probability was considerably higher in
   uncamouflaged-camera nests than in the two other types of nests, while
   there were no differences between the camouflaged-camera and the control
   nests. Survival probability of natural nests was similar to that of
   camouflaged-camera and control nests and significantly lower than that
   of uncamouflaged-camera nests. Any significant differences among nest
   types applied only to predation by Black-billed Magpies (Pica pica);
   predation rates by the garden dormouse (Elyomis quercinus) were similar
   in all experimental treatments. The results suggest that the presence of
   an uncamouflaged camera can affect Black-billed Magpies, which may
   become wary and avoid nests equipped with uncamouflaged cameras. The
   influence of photographic equipment on predation intensity in different
   species is an important factor that should be taken into account in
   studies using artificial nests. The use of control nests is recommended
   to evaluate the potential effects of the camera.}},

Abstract = {{Partners in Flight (PIF) is a consortium of professional and Volunteer
   scientists and educators that promotes the conservation of landbird
   species. Central to the PIT conservation effort is the development of
   Bird Conservation Plans specific to each physiographic region of the
   United States. Without a coordinated prioritization of research needs,
   land managers, researchers, and funding, agencies seeking to conserve
   landbirds lack direction, To address this issue, we (the Research
   Working Group of Partners in Flight) identified research priorities that
   have emerged recently as a result OF Bird Conservation Plan development.
   Research priorities for the coming decade focus on habitat, specifically
   the identification of high-quality habitats and landscapes for breeding,
   migration, and wintering. Identification of the scale of breeding and
   natal dispersal and describing linkages between wintering and breeding
   Populations are also research priorities for the coming decade, A
   summary of research priorities for each of the PIF regions (Northeast,
   Midwest, West, and South) is also provided, Specific research needs
   associated with priority species and habitats in each physiographic area

Abstract = {{A main goal of the Forest Bird Monitoring Program (FBMP) is to monitor
   temporal trends in forest-dwelling bird abundance in Ontario. The
   program has been running for over a decade. The experience gained from
   this program can provide methodological recommendations to anyone
   planning a similar program to monitor trends in bird populations. Power
   analyses on FBMP data indicated that fur species occurring at 50 sites,
   10 yr of annual sampling at either three or five locations (stations)
   per sampling Site would provide adequate (80\%) power to monitor
   declines in annual counts of 2-3\% (18-26\% decline over 10 yr).
   Obtaining this level of power for species found at fewer than 50 sites
   requires more time, The FBMP method of two visits to each site per year
   seems appropriate. The visits provide different information, but there
   is little indication that one sampling window is superior to the other.}},

Abstract = {{Red-plumaged birds (red species) may behave more visibly in the presence
   of a red-orange safety vest that field observers must often wear, but
   species lacking red plumage (non-red species) may behave less visibly
   (i.e., the species-confidence hypothesis). Such responses may bias many
   common counting techniques. We experimentally tested if observer
   clothing color could affect richness and abundance variables derived
   from point counts, During summer and winter, we surveyed point-count
   stations while alternately wearing a red/orange vest (vest counts) and
   not wearing a vest (control counts). Winter estimates of species
   richness, total abundance, abundance of non-red species as a group, and
   the White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) were significantly
   lower when the vest was worn, but red species were not significantly
   different. We did not observe any significant effects of the vest during
   summer counts. Power was high for community-level variables and
   intermediate for non-red species, but low power and marginally
   significant results suggested that we might have failed to detect
   effects on red species. Several factors may account for why we observed
   effects on non-red species during winter but not summer: species
   composition varied between seasons, dense summer foliage may have
   obscured the vest from view, or territoriality and nesting activities
   may have dampened avoidance behaviors during summer. Although effects of
   clothing color were significant For the winter season, managers and
   biologists should avoid risk of bias by restricting observers to dark or
   drab colored clothing for all seasons and for all avian sampling
   techniques, not just winter point counts.}},

   mainly among North and Central American jays, but in only one South
   American species. In this note,we present evidence that the Cayenne Jay
   (Cyanocorax cayanus) is also a communal breeder. Cayenne Jays occur in
   family-sized groups in forest habitat in southern Venezuela. More than
   two individuals have access to the nest and feed the nestlings. Members
   of one group participated in the defense of the nest by mobbing it
   preserved boa. These observations Suggest that Cayenne Jays, like other
   species of Cyanacorax, form coherent social units and that helpers
   typically aid in the care of the young or potential young.}},

Abstract = {{Few data are available on seasonal changes in winter diet of Harlequin
   Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), especially in relation to their use
   of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) spawn. We used fecal analyses to
   determine seasonal changes in Harlequin Duck winter diet at a site where
   Pacific herring spawn. We measured frequency of occurrence and relative
   abundance by volume of prey remains in 202 fecal samples collected
   during four date periods in 1998 and 1999. These two measures were
   highly correlated. We identified snails, crabs, limpets, and chitons as
   the principal animal prey, and ranked relative importance of most prey
   types in similar order as previous studies using stomach analyses. Crabs
   parts constituted the majority of prey remains during molt, and we
   concluded that crabs were dominant in the diet during molt because crabs
   generally have greater organic content and less hard-part remains per
   unit of body mass than other hard-shelled prey consumed at that time.
   Snail remains were highest in frequency of occurrence during winter.
   Herring eggs were not detected in feces until a week after herring
   spawned, but abrupt changes in other prey types indicated that herring
   eggs were the principal prey throughout the spawn period. Polychaetes
   increased in importance in winter and spring, and rated third in
   frequency of occurrence in spring. We recommend using fecal analyses to
   determine Frequency of occurrence of prey in the diet of other sea-ducks
   that are known to feed on hard-shelled molluscs and crustaceans.
   Measures of relative abundance of prey remains can be useful if
   conversion factors relating hard-part remains to whole-body biomass are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Five male Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) were observed and songs
   recorded over entire breeding seasons in central Kentucky. Songs
   consisted of an average of 3.02 notes and the mean time between the
   beginning of successive songs within a bout was 7.26 s. Most songs
   (63.7\%) given by male bluebirds were low volume, while 14.8\% were
   moderate volume, and 21.5\% were high volume. Individual mate bluebirds
   possessed large ((x) over bar = 59.4) repertoires of song types, and few
   were shared among two or more males. Singing rates varied among breeding
   stages, with high rates during the pre-pairing period suggesting that
   song plays a role in mate attraction. However, male bluebirds also sing
   during interactions with conspecific males, indicating an aggressive or
   territorial function, to facilitate the transfer of food to incubating
   or brooding females, nestlings, and fledglings, and to warn mates,
   nestlings, or fledglings about the presence of a potential predator.
   Thus, as reported in an increasing number of species, singing by male
   bluebirds serves multiple functions.}},

Abstract = {{Although reports of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism
   have increased in the Southeast over the past 30 yr, the cowbird's
   status, distribution, and host relations within this region remain
   largely unknown. We collected information on cowbird abundance and
   cowbird/host interactions (parasitism frequency and intensity, hatching
   success of cowbirds, and host anti-parasite strategies) in an old field
   in the South Carolina coastal plain from Match through August 1997 and
   1998. We located 346 nests, representing 16 species, within the study
   area (Dill Sanctuary, James Island, Charleston Co., South Carolina).
   Female cowbird abundance (1.2\% of all songbird territories) was low
   within the avian community; however, cowbird eggs were discovered in
   nests of 12 of 16 species found nesting within the study area. Although
   cowbird young were successfully fledged from 67\% of host species'
   nests, five species exhibited an anti-parasite strategy (nest
   abandonment, cowbird egg burial, or egg ejection). The presence of these
   behaviors is possibly the result of gene flow into the Population from
   areas of longer co-existence with the parasite, However, we present an
   alternative theory that southeastern, early-successional hosts may have
   retained rejection behaviors from ancestors previously exposed to
   cowbird parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of vocalizing individuals are useful in detecting widely
   dispersed species that are hard to locate visually. We determined
   whether conspecific density affects spontaneous vocalizations of
   territorial Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and thus creates a bias in passive
   auditory surveys. We mainly listened to dusk call displays of 17 males
   breeding in two areas of high and low density from the beginning of call
   activity in October to the start of egg-laying in February, We detected
   differences in call behavior between males breeding in high density vs.
   low density. The nearest neighbor distance between breeding males
   strongly and positively affected call duration. Low density caused low
   detectability of male Eagle Owls, and later timing of the first call
   after sunset. Failing to incorporate conspecific density and nearest
   neighbor distances in surveys of territorial species may reduce the
   accuracy of population estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the reproductive biology of a population of Blue-fronted
   Amazons (Amazona aestiva) in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil, between 1997 and 1999. Nesting occurred from August to December.
   We monitored 94 nests which were found in trees of different sizes.
   Nesting trees were distributed in all major vegetation associations
   (floodplains, grasslands, scrub savanna, savanna, arboreal savanna,
   riparian forests, and pastures). We found about half of nests (53\%) in
   an open and disturbed area of 34 km(2), yielding a density of 0.5
   nests/km(2), In the remaining 486 km(2) of the study area, we estimated
   a mean density of 0.03 nests/km(2). This could reflect preferences
   towards open and anthropic-influenced habitats or simply visibility
   bias. We found most of the nests in Palmae, Leguminosae, and
   Bignoniaceac, but the proportion of successful nests did not differ
   between tree types. Average clutch size varied little among the three
   ears of study, but nest survival and the proportion of fledglings per
   female were lower in 1998 than in 1997 and 1999. The cause of the lower
   fledging Success in 1998 was not determined, but deforestation, an early

   used very similar habitat, both selecting larger, more open shrubs. In
   spite of similar foraging habitat, comparisons of habitat use by the two
   species at the sympatric sites yielded no evidence of foraging habitat
   partitioning or exclusion. There was evidence of nesting habitat
   partitioning. Wilson's Warblers nested on the ground, with some evidence
   that they used smaller, more densely stemmed shrubs under which to nest.
   Yellow Warblers are shrub nesters and selected larger, more open shrubs
   in which to nest. Results provide no evidence that Yellow Warblers can
   be blamed for population declines in Wilson's Warblers.}},

Abstract = {{Males of socially monogamous species may benefit from using behavioral
   tactics to ensure their paternity of the young produced by their social
   mates. We tested whether male Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) use
   mate guarding and high song output in an attempt to prevent extra-pair
   copulations (EPC) by their Marc,. in this species, most EPC intrusions
   occur when females produce conspicuous chip vocalizations. Using
   radiotelemetry, we tracked the male response to female chipping
   throughout her fertile and non-fertile periods, Our results show that
   mates do not intensively guard their mates by closely associating with
   dicni or by increasing their song rate. Mate guarding was not influenced
   by male age or their own EPC behavior. Female influence on
   fertilizations and male pursuit of EPC may render mate guarding an
   ineffective strategy fur ensuring paternity in Hooded Warblers.}},

Abstract = {{Gender identification is important in demographic studies of bird
   populations but is difficult with monomorphic bird species. Flow
   cytometry, a method which estimates differences in DNA content in
   erythrocyte nuclei, is one potential sexing method. In another sexing
   method, differences between the autosomal and sex-linked (W) copies of
   the chromo-helicase-DNA binding (CHD) gene can be determined using the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frozen blood samples collected during
   the breeding season from known-sex adults and juvenile birds were used
   to test the applicability of flow cytometry and PCR as sexing methods
   for the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). With flow cytometry 86\% of
   14 known adults were definitively and correctly sexed. PCR correctly
   sexed 100\% of I I known adults. Of the 18 juveniles, 15 were sorted
   definitively by flow cytometry: 14 as male and one as female. PCR sexed
   the same 18 juveniles as 11 males and seven females, including the three
   juveniles that were unclassified by flow cyrometry. In addition, three
   juveniles identified as males using flow cytometry were identified as
   females by PCR, among which were two individuals that consistently fell
   into the high end of the male genome size range. We conclude that PCR is
   a reliable sexing method for the Wood Thrush, but flow cytometry has
   limited reliability due to the lack of disparity in intergender genome
   size.}},

Abstract = {{We describe observational evidence of niche shifts of smaller species in
   response to the presence of larger species in flocks of tits in Korea.
   Overall, in this guild of tits there was more aggression directed from
   larger toward smaller species than vice versa. At the guild level, there
   was a significant effect of the presence of larger species on vertical
   rather than horizontal distribution of smaller species. For example, in
   the presence of the dominant P varius, the subordinate P major foraged
   at lower heights than in the absence of P varius. This is the first
   observation of foraging niche shifts in P major, a typical dominant in
   European flocks, in response to the presence of larger P varius, absent
   in European flocks of tits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the area search method to
   measure breeding landbird populations at the plot level. During June
   1999, 10 plots in grassland and shelterbelt habitats of north-central
   South Dakota were surveyed three times using the area search method. The
   results were then compared with those simultaneously obtained by the
   spot mapping census method, which served as the standard for comparison.
   Area searches detected an average of 96.0\% of the landbird species
   present on the grassland plots, and 84.2\% of the species on the
   shelterbelt plots. Species accumulation curves were identical between
   techniques, suggesting that an increase in number of visits to each plot
   would likely increase the number of species detected during area search
   surveys. Estimates of territory density from spot mapping were available
   for five passerine species. Across all species, area searches
   underestimated territory densities by an average of 50\% when visit data
   were summarized by taking the average. When data were summarized using
   the maximum value among visits to each plot, area searches
   underestimated territory density by an average of 26\%. Precision of
   density estimates using area search was similar between summarization
   methods, and was generally lower in comparison to spot mapping. Across
   all species, area search and spot mapping density estimates were
   strongly associated, suggesting that area search has potential as an
   index to abundance. However, correlation coefficients in abundance
   varied considerably within individual species. Since area search surveys
   typically underestimated both species richness and density of
   territories, further experimentation with increased survey duration is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Austral migrant birds were banded during austral fall (March-April) and
   spring (October-November) in the Chaco of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The
   Tyrannidae was the most common family captured in terms of number of
   species and total individuals. The difference in capture numbers between
   the austral spring and fall seasons was the greatest for the Fuscous
   Flycatcher (Cnemotriccus fuscatus), although most species exhibited
   little change among seasons. In terms of numbers of captures across each
   season, no apparent trends in migratory timing were evident. The
   Creamy-bellied Thrush (Turdus amaurochalinus) exhibited similar fat
   class distributions among seasons. Within-season trends showed that in
   fall Creamy-bellied Thrushes with lower fat levels arrived at the study
   site earlier than fatter birds. Most migrant species captured were not
   sexually dimorphic or in breeding condition, so sexing was generally not
   possible. Our lack of knowledge on habitat use and migratory routes of
   austral migrants in the Chaco, combined with the Current high rate of
   habitat destruction in the region, makes an understanding of the
   migratory patterns of these birds important.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding bird communities of 19 reclaimed surface

   ha). Although dominated by a few Eurasian grass species, they supported
   diverse bird communities in which grassland-dependent species were
   prominent along with grassland-associated and successional scrub
   species. The mean abundances of species (relative to one another) on
   roadside and off-road counts were positively correlated. Red-winged
   Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna),
   and Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) were present at >90\%
   of piza americana), Eastern point count locations. Other common species,

Abstract = {{We studied the behavior of the Dusky Bush-Tanager (Chlorospingus
   semifuscus; Thraupinae) in Southwestern Colombia, where it seems to
   exhibit singing assemblages resembling leks. A lek mating system would
   be paradoxical in a genus noted for its active participation in
   mixed-species flocks, largely insectivorous diet, and stable pair bond.
   We used the bird's behavior and the relations between fruit
   availability, its diet, and its participation in mixed flocks to try to
   explain the social system. We found males singing in dense linear
   assemblages, regularly spaced along ridgetops, during early morning and
   late afternoon hours during much of the year, with a peak from May
   through August. Singing males occupied small circular territories, which
   usually were reoccupied the next year by the same males. The critical
   resource is likely the males themselves, although fruit availability may
   permit them to remain on territories for long periods; nesting areas are
   apparently far from the ridgetops. Participation in flocks occured
   year-round but was somewhat reduced during the singing season and in the
   singing hours. The evidence of pair bonds in this species, in which
   males participate at least in nest-site selection and feeding of young,
   excludes the possibility of a lek mating system in the strict sense.
   Nevertheless, the system of singing linear assemblies appears to have
   been superimposed upon the typical social system of the genus. This
   social system is unique in the entire nine-primaried oscine assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Energetic costs of nest construction are difficult to estimate for
   birds, and currently estimates are available for only a handful of
   species. In this paper, I estimate the minimum cost of nest construction
   by a pair of Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia). Data on the number of
   sticks, and mud pellets comprising a nest were used to determine the
   minimum number of trips required to construct the nest, and were
   combined with information on distances to the nearest sources of nesting
   materials, data on flight speeds, and bird morphometric measures to
   estimate costs of transporting nesting materials. For the Black-billed
   Magpie pair I observed, nest construction required a minimum of 2564
   trips for nesting materials, 276.2 km of commuting, 8.4 h of flight, and
   cost 209.1 kJ. Spreading this cost over the 40 d required to build the
   nest yields an estimate of 2.61 kJ/adult/day. I compared this value to
   published estimates of daily metabolizable energy intake for
   Black-billed Magpies, and calculated that breeding adults would need to
   increase their daily intake between 0.7\% and 1.0\% to cover the
   energetic costs of nest construction. In contrast, egg laying is
   estimated to require a full 23\% of the daily energy expenditure of
   female magpies, These values suggest the energetic cost of nest building
   in Black-billed Magpies is relatively insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{We examined nest-site selection by Spanish Imperial Eagles (Aquila
   adalberti) in Donana National Park (southwestern Spain) from 1984-1994.
   Spanish Imperial Eagles are large birds of prey that defend and occupy a
   territory year-round. Identifying a territory's nest-site
   characteristics represents a critical step in safeguarding this
   endangered species' habitat. We measured seven habitat variables
   describing microhabitat, vegetative composition, land use, and degree of
   human influence for 73 nest sites averaged for 14 occupied territories
   and 73 randomly selected sites for 14 unoccupied territories. Our best
   logistic regression model included two habitat variables representing
   microhabitat (height of nest tree) and human influence (distance to the
   nearest urban centre). The logistic regression model correctly
   classified 78.6\% of the occupied and 85.7\% of unoccupied territories.
   This analysis suggests that the presently occupied Spanish Imperial
   Eagle territories represent the majority of the remaining suitable
   habitat for this endangered species in and around Donana National Park.
   There is an urgent need to create suitable nest sites for Spanish
   Imperial Eagles that would include tall trees in small tree stands away
   from intense human activity.}},

   terrestrial bird surveys during the breeding season. However, there is
   relatively little information specifically addressing the methodology of
   bird surveys at other times of the year when birds are less vocal and
   are mobile over areas larger than territories. We tested a method for
   surveying forest birds in winter, based on the use of playbacks of
   mobbing calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapilla). When
   compared to pre-playback 5-min standard point counts, playbacks of
   mobbing calls of the same duration allowed the detection of more
   individuals and more species. Time of day, with or without playbacks,
   had no effect on the number of individuals detected or on species
   richness. We recommend the use of playbacks of mobbing calls of
   Black-capped Chickadees for surveying forest birds during the
   non-breeding season because of their efficiency.}},

   immobilize King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) in the field was
   tested in non-incubating and incubating adults and in chicks. We also
   compared the behavioral and physiological response to this anesthetic
   agent according to the position used for immobilization (dorsal: lying
   on the back; ventral: lying on the belly) and following repeated
   administrations at one or several day intervals throughout a prolonged
   natural fast. A 5-mg/kg dosage administered intra-muscularly allowed an
   efficient immobilization of 97\% of the adults for about one hour and
   after an induction time averaging 5 min. Birds kept in the dorsal
   position and without thermal insulation remained immobilized longer than
   those kept in the ventral position. Chicks were immobilized for 80 min
   after receiving a 4-mg/kg dosage. The anesthetized birds lost the pain,
   noise, touch and podal reflex but not the palpebral one and showed no
   major side effects. Penguins responded similarly to repeated injections
   and recovered without complications or adverse reactions. Five of eight
   incubating adults resumed incubation after having been anesthetized. We
   conclude that immobilization of King Penguins with tiletamine-zolazepam
   is safe and efficient, allowing routine health examination and
   interventions such as, for example, vein catheterization and adipose
   tissue biopsies.}},

Abstract = {{The Venezuelan Wood-Quail (Odontophorus columbianus) is an endemic
   species of Venezuela that dwells in the humid forests of the northern
   coastal mountain range and southeastern Andes. Its biology, ecology and
   conservation status are poorly known. The aim of this study was to
   establish quantitative relationships between the presence and absence of
   the species and habitat features in the humid forest of Henri Pittier
   National Park, Aragua State, Venezuela. Twenty-six habitat variables
   were recorded in 20 plots located at places where quails were observed
   while foraging and compared with those of 22 plots located at random in
   areas where quails were not observed. Principal component analysis and
   logistic regression were used to identify the relevant set of variables
   determining the presence or absence of the species. The best predictive
   variables were high frequency of non-palm monocots, high vertical
   foliage density, and low frequency of palms (Bactris spp). The logistic
   model allows one to predict the presence or absence of quails in similar
   areas to those of our study with probabilities of 0.80 and 0.86,
   respectively. This type of habitat analysis may help in the designing of
   future research and management plans for this and other elusive, poorly
   known species.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding performance of very old Common Terns (Sterna
   hirundo) at Bird Island, USA (41degrees40degreesN, 70degrees43degreesW)
   in 1999. We studied birds aged greater than or equal to 18 yr,
   comprising the oldest 5\% of the birds breeding at this site. We located
   24 of these old birds and measured their breeding performance, including
   laving dates, clutch sizes, egg masses, catching success, chick growth,
   chick survival, and overall productivity. We compared their performance
   with that of several reference groups, including a date-matched group of
   Young birds aged 6-9 yr and date-matched birds of all ages. Breeding
   performance declined with laying date in all groups. The old birds were
   more successful in raising chicks than any of the reference groups.
   Within the group of old birds, breeding performance remained high or
   improved with age, even after controlling for effects of laying date.
   Males and females were represented equally among the group of old birds;
   there was no evidence that performance was higher among old males or old
   females. If the Common Terns at this site experience any senescent
   decline in breeding performance within their 20-25 yr lifespan, this
   must be offset either by increased reproductive effort or by selective
   survival of high quality individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of cavity excavation by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides

   Forest in east Texas. We compared the race of natural cavity excavation
   between 1983 and 1990 (before artificial cavities were available) with
   the rate of cavity excavation between 1992 and 1999, a period when
   artificial cavities were regularly installed within active woodpecker
   cavity-tree clusters. Our comparison was restricted to cavity-tree
   clusters in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P
   taeda)-shortleaf (P echinata) pine habitats where woodpecker groups were
   present for the entire period between 1983 and 1999. Excavation rate of
   new cavities was significantly higher in longleaf pine habitat when
   artificial cavities were not available than during the subsequent period
   when artificial cavities were provided in all active cavity-tree
   clusters. In loblolly-shortleaf pine habitat, we did not detect a
   significant difference in the rate of new cavity excavation between he
   periods before and after the use of artificial cavities. We attribute
   the difference in results between habitats to a relative scarcity of
   cavities in loblolly-shortleaf pine sites due to a higher bark
   beetle-induced cavity tree mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of food availability for avian insectivores are desirable,
   but are complicated by the range of microhabitats insects occupy and the
   difficulty of comparing non-standard techniques across studies. We
   describe an efficient method for sampling wood-boring beetle larvae, an
   important food of many woodpeckers, beneath the bark of fire-killed
   trees. The method involves taking two 225-cm(2) bark samples from each
   tree, and provides enough information to rank most trees by relative
   wood-borer abundance. At two sites in the northern Rocky Mountains, we
   tested the reliability of this method by comparing its results to those
   of a more intensive sampling scheme. For 65 trees of four species, we
   collected eight bark samples at two different heights, 1.7 m and 6 m,
   and compared correlations between the smaller, ground-based sampling
   scheme (two bark samples) and the larger, eight-sample effort. With one
   exception, correlations for individual tree species ranged from 0.79 to
   0.95, indicating that the smaller sample gave rankings of insect
   abundance comparable to those of the larger sample. Correlation
   strengths differed between sites, suggesting that the larger sample
   Could be employed at future sites to fine-rune the smaller sampling
   scheme. Correlations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at one site
   were very low, suggesting that wood-borers may colonize ponderosa pine
   in a manner different from the other tree species studied. The strong
   correlations produced by this test indicate that, with limited effort
   and training, even small field crews (e.g., two workers) can use this
   method to rank the foraging resources contained in dead trees.}},

Abstract = {{We used a three-year point-count data set from Hoosier National Forest,
   Indiana, to evaluate alternative point-count sampling strategies for
   detecting songbird declines. Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that mean
   abundance estimates increased with increasing count radius (P < 0.0001,
   each species), and coefficients of variation (CVs) decreased. Mean
   abundance estimates increased with longer count duration (6-, 8-, and
   10-min) for only two of 13 species, and CVs did not necessarily
   decrease. The power to detect a 5\% annual Population trend increased
   with more survey points, more visits per point, and more years of
   surveys. Managers can use observer time most efficiently by employing
   counts of short duration. Counts using a larger radius will reduce CVs
   and therefore provide potentially better annual estimates of abundance
   and power to detect changes over a period of years. The design of the
   study and nature of the variability in bird abundance will determine
   whether increasing the number of points, or the number of visits per
   point, will have greater effect on power to detect a population trend.}},

Abstract = {{During March-June 2000 we evaluated the use of call-response surveys to
   monitor breeding Yuma Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris yumanensis) at
   the Cienega de Santa Clara, Colorado River Delta, Sonora, Mexico. We
   assessed the effect that time of day, stage of breeding season, and
   number of survey periods had on the average number of rails detected at
   a station. Conducting call-response surveys resulted in a significant
   increase in the number of detected rails and reduced the coefficient of
   variation of the average number or rails per station, which increases
   the statistical power to detect population trends. Using this technique
   also appears to reduce the variation of rates of responses by rails
   through the breeding season when compared to passive listening. There
   was no difference between the number of rails detected during morning
   and afternoon surveys. The established protocol developed by the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service for Yuma Clapper Rail surveys is adequate for
   monitoring, and it should continue to be implemented on a yearly basis
   at the Cienega de Santa Clara and other wetlands of the Colorado River
   Delta in Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted intensive surveys of breeding and wintering Snowy Plovers
   (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) in San Diego County from 1994 through
   the winter of 1999. We found Snowy Plovers using 11 sites within the
   study area for nesting and at least IS sites were used during winter
   months. Estimated breeding populatioris of Snowy Plovers within San
   Diego County fluctuated among years, and males always outnumbered
   females; fewer than 325 Snowy Plovers were present during any breeding
   season. Two sites consistently supported 65\% of nesting pairs during
   this study, both at military installations. Nesting sites with fewer
   than five breeding pairs were unlikely to produce fledglings. Nest
   success over the entire area ranged from 50-58\% and reproductive
   success was on average fewer than 0.5 fledglings produced per adult
   plover. Approximately 227-367 Snowy Plovers wintered within San Diego
   Country from 1995-1999, which is within the range of winter population
   estimates from the mid-1980s. Neither breeding nor wintering numbers of
   plovers in San Diego County have increased since the 1980s, and it is
   unlikely that populations can increase given the low rates of
   reproduction. In addition, the concentration of most nesting pairs at a
   few sites makes this population more vulnerable to local extirpation.}},

Abstract = {{Greater Rheas (Rhea americana) are ground-nesting birds chat have high
   rates of nest desertion commonly associated with egg predation. We
   studied whether male Greater Rheas selected concealed sites to decrease
   decectability of their nests. We analyzed the spatial distribution of
   nests and compared the microhabitat characteristics of nest sites vs.
   sites selected at random, and sites of successful nests vs. sites of
   deserted nests. We also used experimental nests (nests without male
   attention) to assess whether egg losses were associated With the
   microhabitat characteristics of the nest site. The distribution of nest
   sites differed significantly from a random pattern, and nest sites had a
   higher percentage of shrub cover, a lower percentage of grass cover, and
   a higher concealment (low overall visibility) than sites selected at
   random. However, none of the microhabitat characteristics that we
   analyzed were associated with nest failure or the rate of egg loss.
   Experimental nests that were more visible tended to suffer higher and
   faster egg predation than less visible ones. Our results indicate that
   Greater Rheas selected concealed sites for nesting, but they did not get
   any apparent benefit for selecting these sites. We propose that habitat
   alteration and the type of predation that this species suffers at
   present may have reduced the benefits of selecting concealed sites for
   nesting.}},

Abstract = {{Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) typically favor nest sites with 10-30\%
   vegetative cover, and cover >30\% may decrease nest success. Vegetation
   manipulations were performed in summer 1998 on Lime Island, Michigan, to
   determine if vegetative structure affects nest success of Common Terns.
   Three treatments (partial and complete herbicide and a control) were
   randomly assigned to 5 x 5-m plots. Our results suggest that Common
   Terns on Lime Island have the greatest nest success in areas that
   contain moderate amounts (about 40\%) of total standing vegetation cover
   and litter cover (about 50\%) that were associated with the partial
   herbicide areas. Although the greatest number of Common Tern nests were
   located in areas with 10-30\% standing cover and >65\% litter cover
   (complete herbicide), those areas had the lowest nest success.
   Researchers should not disregard the importance of areas that typically
   support fewer nests in greater amounts of standing vegetation cover when
   evaluating the nest Success of Common Terns.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory predicts that individuals should resort to
   kleptoparasitizing food when the net energy obtained from this behavior
   is greater than that gained from searching for food conventionally. We
   studied kleptoparasitism in the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) in
   southwestern Spain. Intraspecific kleptoparasitism in Cattle Egrets was
   rare. We recorded this behavior only when egrets foraged in large flocks
   and when potential victims had captured large prey items. In addition,
   we observed kleptoparasitism in feeding areas with high food
   availability. Food intake rates for both aggressor and victim, prior to
   the attack, were greater than that of undisturbed individuals. Victims
   with defensive behavior maximized their feeding rate by capturing the
   largest prey items and expending the least energy. Kleptoparasites'
   attack success depended mainly on the degree of the victim's resistance
   to releasing prey, which in turn was apparently determined by the
   victim's foraging success and condition. We conclude that intraspecific
   kleptoparasitism in Cattle Egrets is not an optimal foraging behavior,
   but rather is to establish the social status of dominant individuals
   within a foraging flock.}},

Abstract = {{Forced regurgitation by oral administration of tartar emetic has been
   used frequently to examine avian diets because it does not require
   killing birds directly, but indirect (delayed) mortality by this
   technique is not well studied. We examined the effects of tartar emetic
   on re-sighting rates of insectivorous migratory songbirds in Jamaica
   during the non-breeding season. The re-sighting rate of Black-throated
   Blue Warblers (Dendroica ceterulescens) experimentally treated with
   tartar emetic was significantly lower than for control birds. The
   re-sighting rates of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla),
   Black-and-white Warblers (Mniotilta varia), and Prairie Warblers
   (Dendroica discolor) treated with tartar emetic were also lower than
   those of birds that were banded and released without treatment.
   Pre-release mortality rates were low (<3\%), but two created
   Black-throated Blue Warblers were found dead up to 22 h after release.
   Our results suggest application of tartar emetic is an effective but
   invasive method for collecting diet samples from birds. Researchers
   should consider alternatives, and future administration of tartar emetic
   should be conducted conservatively and with acknowledgment of its
   occasionally lethal results.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the incubation behavior of a ground-nesting shorebird,
   the Snowy Plover (Charadrius a. alexandrinus) by developing a
   transponder system that recorded the identity of parents on their nest
   over 24 h. The system consisted of a small chip glued on the tail of the
   parent, an antenna that was buried under the nest, and a recording
   device that was buried nearby. The transponder system was both accurate
   and reliable, since only 0.2\% of records were false. The records of the
   transponder system were augmented by visual observations, and these data
   were analyzed by randomization tests. We found strong daily incubation
   routines: females incubated during the day, whereas males incubated
   mostly at night. Overall, the females spent significantly more time
   incubating the nest (11.3 h (median)/day) than the males (9.4 h/day). We
   discuss several hypotheses for the observed daily incubation routines of
   the sexes, and propose experimental studies to test these hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-seven wild female Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) were marked with
   nasal markers and radio transmitters (implanted subcutaneously on the
   back) just prior to breeding near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, in
   1999 and 2000, Retention rate, of both marker types were evaluated, and
   their effects on specific behavior categories were assessed by
   comparison of marked birds with unmarked control birds. Significant
   effects of nasal markers on behavior were detected; females often
   removed vegetation from nasal markers after diving, and consequently
   marked females tended to shake their head more frequently than unmarked
   birds. No nasal markers were lost during the study. Five females lost
   radios. producing an average retention time of 39 d. Daily retention
   rate was 0.997, being 0.85 when extrapolated to 60 d. The survival rate
   of 42 females radio-tracked consistently was constant for six 7-d
   intervals, suggesting no immediate adverse effect on survival. Because
   the technique is invasive, use of subcutaneous transmitters may not be
   appropriate for all applications, but it could be a preferred
   alternative to other transmitter-attachment methods for short-term
   cracking of waterfowl.}},

Abstract = {{New information on the interactions among Shiny Cowbirds (Molothrus
   bonariensis) and 12 host species in Argentina is presented. Observacions
   and experiments suggest that Brown Cacholotes (Pseudoseisura lophotes)
   remove cowbird eggs from their nests. I present data on care and
   provisioning of Shiny Cowbird chicks by nine species (including five
   icterids), all new or rarely reported in this role in host catalogs.
   Fifteen of 19 (79\%) of the nesting Argentinian icterids are reported as
   Shin Cowbird hosts, and seven (37\%) are known to rear chicks of this
   parasite to fledging (effective hosts). Saffron-cowled Blackbirds
   (Xanthopsar flavus) are frequent effective e hosts but now have a
   restricted distribution. The Pale-breasted Thrush ( Turdus leucomelas)
   was an important effective cowbird host in the area of Iguazu falls, and
   the Diuca Finch (Diuca diuca) is a frequent effective host in the
   Argentinian Patagonia.}},

Abstract = {{We used a modified fish trap called a ``single strip Dutch sleeve{''} to
   capture small rails in Spain. During 94 trap-days, We Captured 29
   individual Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus), three Spotted Crakes (Porzana
   porzana), and nine Common Moorhens (Gallinula chloropus). Use of bait
   such as fruits, vegetables, or cat food increased capture rate by 93\%,
   whereas inclement Weather (heavy rain or Wind) decreased capture rate,
   We had greater rates of capture and recapture compared to other studies
   using different methods. Advantages include ease of transport and
   placement, low injury rates to birds, the possibility of simultaneous
   captures, and a wide spectrum of target species. As improvements, we
   propose the use of playback rail vocalizations to increase capture of
   individuals and species, and the use of rigid, inaccessible receptacles
   to protect captured rails from predators.}},

Abstract = {{From 1936 to 1998 I kept notes on the Riverside Wren (Thryothorus
   semibadius) in southern Pacific Costa Rica. Early in this interval, the
   wrens lived chiefly along the shores of wider streams flowing through
   the forests and around marshy openings in the lowlands. With widespread
   deforestation, they tended to forage and nest farther from the
   watercourses. Their short, ringing songs sound above the clamor of
   mountain torrents. They ear small invertebrates. At all seasons they
   sleep alone or two or three together. in well-enclosed nests such as
   they occupy for breeding. Only the female incubates the two eggs, Laking
   long sessions and long recesses. The incubation period is 18 or 19 d.
   Both parents attend the young. The nestling period is 16 d. The parents
   lead newly emerged fledglings to sleep in a nest with their mother. For
   a year and a half, I followed the activities of a family of four that
   lived in our garden.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the best plumage and morphometric variables for ageing and
   sexing the Maul Parrotbill (Pseudonestor xanthophrys), an endangered
   Hawaiian honeycreep er found only on east Maul, Hawaii, by examining and
   measuring 30 museum specimens and 71 live birds captured in mist nets.
   Juvenal plumage was identified by the presence of pale-tipped wing bars
   on the middle and greater coverts, grayish olive dorsal plumage, and
   dingy white underparts and superciliaries. Birds undergoing first
   prebasic molt retained the juvenal remiges, rectrices, and wing coverts.
   Birds in first basic plumage possessed juvenal wing bars and a dull
   juvenal-like plumage. Subsequent molts were complete, and adults lacked
   wing bars. Adult males had bright yellow plumage on the cheeks, throat,
   and superciliaries, as did 27\% of adult females. All other adult
   females had less yellow in the underparts. The dorsal plumage of adult
   females was more variable than adult males and was either yellow-olive
   like the males or grayish olive. Adult males had longer wing, bill,
   tail, and tarsometatarsus and greater mass than adult females. Virtually
   all males and females could be distinguished by wing length.
   Morphometrics of immature birds were significantly smaller than for
   adult males. Only immature male wing chord was significantly larger than
   that of adult females. Although it was difficult to distinguish between
   immatures and some adult females based on plumage coloration or
   measurements, a cut-off point of 70.4 mm for wing chord separated 91\%
   of females from 93\% of males, regardless of age.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual differences in maximum diving depths and in the composition of
   the diet of the Antarctic Shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) were
   investigated at Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands,
   Antarctica, during the 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 breeding seasons. The
   mean maximum diving depth estimated by the capillary-tube depth gauge
   technique was 37.8 m which, when compared with other studies, reflects
   good food availability in shallow waters around Harmony Point. Females
   dived significantly deeper than males and also reached the maximum dive
   depth registered (112.6 m). The analysis of the stomach contents
   recovered when the individuals with capillary-tubes returned to the nest
   from foraging trips indicated that males ingested almost exclusively
   large Notothenia coriiceps specimens, whereas females preyed more
   intensively on smaller fish. The differences observed suggest that
   individuals of both sexes partitioned foraging depths and food
   resources.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{30-42}},

Abstract = {{The effect of investigator activity on Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa
   tridactyla) was assessed using the disturbance caused by an ongoing
   intensive study investigating chick growth and adult mass loss. Though
   the effects were small, investigator disturbance decreased adult nest
   attendance and increased daily chick loss rates. Whereas overall chick
   survival until day 18 post-hatch was significantly lower in the
   high-disturbance plot in the first year of the study, it was
   substantially higher in the second year. We hypothesize that changes in
   predator activity as an indirect consequence of disturbance were
   responsible for this pattern. Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) which
   nested near the high-disturbance plot and are the main predator of
   kittiwakes in our study area may have been more susceptible to the
   effect of disturbance than the kittiwakes themselves. There was
   otherwise no statistically significant impact of disturbance on chick
   growth, or on adult kittiwakes extending into the following year. Biases
   in studies of kittiwakes due to investigator disturbance may thus be
   negligible when the study is carefully designed. Future studies
   investigating effects of disturbance on birds should, however, include
   data concerning potential predators of the focal species and include
   more than one low-disturbance plot, and should be carried out over two
   or more years.}},

Abstract = {{We describe 14 nest predation events witnessed in the Republic of Panama
   during studies of avian nesting success. Eight predations were by birds,
   including two species of toucan and one forest-falcon. Four predations
   were by two species of snake, one was by monkeys, and one near-predation
   was by arm) ants (Eciton burchelli). In three cases, a fraction of the
   nest contents were removed by the predator on one visit before it
   returned later to consume the remaining items. Our observations,
   although limited to diurnal encounters, indicate that Neotropical birds
   are susceptible to a diverse array of potential predators. Detailed
   investigations using cameras are needed to quantify the potential
   importance of each predator species and to identify the occurrence and
   importance of nocturnal predation.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have attempted to calculate the energy intake rates of
   shorebirds. One method of doing this involves estimating the size of
   prey items in relation to the bird's bill length, and then using an
   average bill length to convert this value to actual prey length in order
   to estimate prey mass/energy content. Although this technique is used
   regularly no study has assessed under what conditions the method is
   reliable. Observer distance from the bird, prey type, size and
   orientation in the bill, bill length and shape, and light conditions may
   all affect the accuracy of the estimates. This study sought to establish
   the conditions under which the method is or is not reliable, using three
   different prey types ({''}thin{''} and ``fat{''} polychaetes, and crabs)
   and a long- and short-billed bird. It was found that if observers were
   calibrated, and their results were corrected using regression analysis,
   errors in estimates of food intake were much reduced. The time allowed
   to view the prey significantly affected the error in the result, with
   shorter viewing time causing greater errors, and observations made into
   the light were less accurate than those made with the light behind the
   observer. Large prey types, or even larger size classes of the same
   species, are estimated less accurately than small prey, and accuracy
   decreases as prey size increases as multiples of bill length. If
   separate calibration regressions are generated for large and small prey,
   food intake estimates are more accurate than if a single regression is
   used incorporating the full range of prey sizes. Sexual dimorphism in
   bill length can also increase error in the results.}},

Abstract = {{A Band-rumped Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma castro) banded in the Azores was
   recovered in the Gulf of Mexico south of Pensacola, Florida. Research in
   breeding colonies in the Azores indicates that two genetically distinct
   breeding forms of this storm-petrel exist, one that breeds in the cool
   season (August-January), another that breeds in the hot season
   (April-September). The individual recovered from the Gulf was a
   representative of the cool-season breeders. Only recently has it become
   known that Band-rumped Storm-Petrels are regular in the western Atlantic
   Ocean when not breeding. Based on recent reports (sightings) and records
   (salvaged specimens), probably they also are regular in the Gulf of
   Mexico. If the two forms are determined to be separate species, a new
   challenge exists, namely to determine if they are distinguishable other
   than from measurements and genetic analysis. Careful record keeping and
   willingness to donate specimens to research institutions by per sons in
   charge of rehabilitation facilities could help clarify this situation
   and others related to the distribution of pelagic birds.}},

Abstract = {{A common assumption made when conducting broadcast surveys for owls is
   that vocalizations of larger owls reduce the responsiveness of smaller
   owls. We tested this assumption by comparing the responsiveness of Elf
   Owls (Micrathene whitneyi) exposed to the taped calls df conspecifics
   and to imitations of Great Horned Owls (Budo virginianus). Elf Owls were
   more responsive to conspecific calls during courtship and incubation.
   but less responsive during the nestling stage, than they were to Great
   Horned Owl calls. This was because responsiveness to conspecific calls
   decreased through the nesting season, but responsiveness to Great Horned
   Owl calls was consistent throughout the nesting season. Singing Elf Owls
   switched from song to scold vocalizations more frequently after hearing
   a Great Horned Owl call (83.3\%) than when hearing a conspecific call
   (33.3\%). The responsiveness of Elf Owls to Great Horned Owl calls may
   benefit studies conducted throughout the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed birds on seven small (<3 km(2)) offshore islands in the
   Independent State of Samoa to investigate the distribution and abundance
   of landbirds relative to abiotic and biotic features of these islands.
   We recorded 17 of the 28 indigenous species of landbirds that reside in
   Independent Samoa. Species richness among the islands ranged from 3 to
   12 species. Other than the domestic chicken, none of the non-native
   species common on the large islands of `Upolu and Savai'i was recorded
   on offshore islands. Nu'utele, the third-largest of the seven islands,
   had the greatest proportion of native forest and harbored the most
   species of landbirds, including five not found on any other offshore
   island (Tooth-billed Pigeon {[}Didunculus strigirostris], West
   Polynesian Ground-Dove {[}Gallicolumba stairi], Pacific Pigeon {[}Ducula
   pacifica], Samoan Whistler {[}Pachycephala flavifrons], and Samoan
   Flycatcher {[}Myiagra albiventris]). The similarly sized Apolima, which
   is inhabited and extensively cultivated, had only six species, about the
   same as the much smaller but forested Namua. Manono, the largest island,
   also has the largest human population, and harbored 10 landbird species.
   These included two species not recorded on Nu'utele (Banded Rail {[}
   Gallirallus philippensis] and Purple Swamphen {[}Porphyrio porphyrio]),
   both of which prefer disturbed habitats to native forest. Habitat and
   human disturbance, rather than abiotic variables such as area and
   distance to the nearest island, are the primary factors influencing the
   distribution of birds on small offshore islands, especially those >1.0
   km(2).}},

Abstract = {{By radio-tracking and recording the movements of flocks. the
   distribution of feeding Red Knots (Calidris canutus rufa) was studied
   day and night at a migration stopover site near San Antonio Oeste, Rio
   Negro, Argentina in March and April 1998. By day, the birds fed in dense
   flocks of 500-4000 on an area of restinga or rock platform where there
   were beds of the small mussel Brachidontes rodriguezi. By night this
   site was deserted, and the birds were found widely scattered over nearby
   sandflats. It was evident that the birds were feeding at night because
   variation in the signal strength of the radio-transmitters indicated
   that the birds were active. Also fresh knot droppings were found in an
   area which only became exposed by the tide after dark. The reason for
   the change in feeding distribution may be that the restinga is close to
   terrestrial habitats that harbor night-adapted predators. Therefore it
   is avoided at night. By day, it may be safer because better visibility
   means that predators can be identified more readily. Alternatively, it
   could be that feeding opportunities become available at night that are
   better than on the restinga, and this is why the birds feed elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the extent of molt in Steppe Buzzards (Buteo buteo
   vulpinus),Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus), Levant Sparrowhawks
   (Accipiter brevipes), and Eurasian Spar rowhawks (A. nisus) caught
   during spring migration 1985-1988 in flat, southern Israel. Ten percent
   of yearling Steppe Buzzards (58 of 550) and four percent of yearling
   Marsh Harriers (3 of 77) were actively molting their remiges while on
   migration. These findings are contrary to suggestions that birds do not
   molt their flight feathers during migration when they should avoid extra
   energy expenditure and maintain flight performance. Active molt of
   primaries and secondaries, however, was not found among adult buzzards
   and harriers, or in any individual of the two Accipiter species. Molt
   strategies may be related to differences in flight mode during migration
   between species that primarily soar (buzzards and harriers) and species
   that flap more (sparrowhawks). Body condition was not related to the
   state of molt. This, and the fact that only yearling birds were in
   active molt of remiges, suggest that a delay in arrival on the breeding
   grounds may be a significant cost of molt during spring migration.}},

Abstract = {{Male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) are known to give alarm
   calls in response to the approach of a predator, and to encode
   information about the level of threat in their calling behavior. To
   determine whether such sentinel males alert females, we conducted a
   simple field experiment in which we measured the distances at which
   incubating females flushed from their nests in response to the approach
   of a human observer. Using a matched-pairs design, we measured flushing
   distances with a sentinel male present (mean 19.8 m), and when the same
   male was absent from his territory (mean 10.4 m). Female Red-winged
   Blackbirds flushed from their nests at significantly greater distances
   when males were present th;ln when males were absent. These results and
   those of other studies support the existence of a ``predator early
   warning system{''} in the Red-winged Blackbird.}},

Abstract = {{The percentage of otherwise successful nests containing greater than or
   equal to 1 unhatched egg in Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)
   varied inversely with colony size in southwestern Nebraska. Colony-site
   characteristics other than colony size had no significant effect on egg
   hatchability: The incidence of unhatched eggs at a colon), site did not
   var) significantly with year, mean date of first egg laying, mean
   incubation period, extent of ectoparasitism, or mean body mass of
   nestlings or adults. This suggests that increased hatching failure ill
   smaller colonies was unrelated to ectoparasitism by fleas and cimicid
   bugs, foraging success, or egg inattendance. Furthermore, because
   reproductive interference and incidence of brood parasitism do not
   increase in smaller colonies, these variables seem unlikely to account
   for the relationship between egg hatchability and colony size. More
   frequent matings between genetically similar individuals and reduced
   opportunities for females to seek extrapair fertilizations with outbred
   males or as fertility insurance might explain reduced egg hatchability
   in small colonies. Increased hatching success in larger colonies may he
   a benefit of coloniality; for Cliff Swallows.}},

   pileatus) is essential in managing viable populations of the species. In
   eight study areas in northeastern Oregon, survivorship of adult Pileated
   Woodpeckers was 0.60 after 6 mo, 0.47 after 12 mo, and 0.35 after 18 mo.
   Of three juveniles radio-tagged in late summer or fall, two survived to
   breed the next year. Of 13 juveniles radio-tagged as nestlings, 23-54\%
   survived 3.5 mo. In these populations adult mortality exceeded
   recruitment of young into the breeding population. Survival may have
   been influenced by transmitter attachments, habitat quality, or annual

Abstract = {{Creation of forested edges in some landscapes can increase the risk of
   nest pre dation and consequently lower the reproductive success of
   forest passerines. This edge effect has not been well studied in western
   coniferous forests, particularly in southeast Alaska. In a series of
   artificial nest predation experiments, conducted in southeast Alaska
   between 1994 and 1997, we tested the risk of nest predation among open,
   edge, and interior forest habitats associated with natural (wetland) and
   anthropogenically created (clearcuts and suburbs) openings in coniferous
   north-temperate rainforest. We also censused known (Steller's Jays
   {[}Cyanocitta stelleri] and red squirrels {[}Tamiasciurus hudsonicus])
   and probable nest predators (Common Ravens {[}Corvus corax] and
   Northwestern Crows {[}C. caurinus]). In general, higher nest predation
   was seen in habitats with the highest abundance of nest predators. Nests
   in wetland forest edges, where both jays and squirrels were detected
   frequently, were depredated more often than those in wetland openings or
   forest interior, where predators were less common. High nest predation
   was seen on the edges of suburbs where jays and crows were abundant, and
   in clearcut openings, edges, and interior forest, where squirrels were a
   common nest predator throughout. Type and abundance of predators
   differed among habitats and possibly with degree of forest
   fragmentation, edge type, and forest matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In the Fraser River Delta, scavenging of poisoned waterfowl by raptors
   during winter has led to secondary anticholinesterase poisoning. During
   the winters of 1996 and 1998, we used still and video photography to
   examine scavenging activity on waterfowl carcasses in agricultural
   fields. Carcass discovery was rapid for both study years; all but two of
   54 carcasses were found within 72 h, and 77.8\% were found within 24 h
   (primarily in the first 12 h after sunrise). Single duck carcasses
   attracted a mean of 16.6 individual scavengers (range 0-79). Seven
   different species fed on a carcass at least once during 1998, with Bald
   Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Northwestern Crows (Corvus
   caurinus) being the most common scavengers. In 1996, Bald Eagles arrived
   first in 26.7\% of the trials. In 1998, Northwestern Crows arrived first
   in 50.0\% of the trials with Bald Eagles and Northern Harriers (Circus
   cyaneus) each arriving first in 16.7\% of the trials. Results:
   demonstrate that individual poisoned duck carcasses can place numerous
   scavengers of a variety of species at risk for secondary poisoning due
   to high incidence of discovery and rapid exchange of information among
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{Killdeers (Charadrius vociferus) are considered a common species that
   inhabits a wide range of wetland and upland habitats throughout much of
   North America, yet recent information suggests that they may be
   declining regionally, if not throughout much of their range. To address
   this issue, we examined population trends of this species at multiple
   spatial and temporal scales using data from two major avian survey
   efforts, the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and Christmas Bird Count (CBC).
   A summary of BBS vends indicates significant longterm (1966-1996)
   declines in breeding populations across North America. Geographic
   regions driving this decline were Canada, western survey regions of the
   continent, and select southeastern states. In contrast, over the same
   time period, Killdeer populations increased in some midwestern states,
   particularly those in the Great Lakes region. Recent BBS trends
   (1986-1996) indicate highly significant declines across most areas of
   North America surveyed. Trends from CBC data (1959-1988) indicate
   declines at a smaller spatial scale. While the ability of current major
   avian survey efforts to detect population trends for Killdeer and other
   shorebird species warrants further examination, significant negative
   vends in Killdeer populations indicates the need to further investigate
   the status of this species.}},

Abstract = {{We radio-tagged Black Rails (Laterallus jamaicensis) and located active
   nests at two sites in Florida from May 1992 to August 1996. We collected
   telemetry locations from 1-6 h daily during the egg-laying and
   incubation period. Home range estimates differed significantly between
   sexes: males used 1.3 ha and females used 0.62 ha. Nests were found at
   all stages of egg-laying and incubation using radio telemetry and visual
   nest searching. Nests were located during each month from May through
   August. Nests were constructed over moist soil in low (less than or
   equal to1 m) dense herbaceous vegetation. Black Rails preferred nest
   sites near hyper-saline patches of bare sand. The Mayfield estimate of
   nesting success was 43\%, nest failures were caused by flooding and
   predation. Imported red fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) were observed
   constructing mounds under three nests and killed one hatchling before it
   emerged from the egg. Water level and hydrology may have the greatest
   impact oil nest-site selection and nesting success of Black Rails.}},

Abstract = {{We review the extralimital occurrence of Cave Swallows (Petrochelidon
   fulva) in the United States and Canada since the 1960s. Nineteen (29\%)
   of 65 occurrences not associated with an incursion in late autumn 1999
   have been verified with photographs or specimens. Spring specimens of
   the West Indian subspecies P. fulva fulva are from Alabama and Nova
   Scotia the subspecies of a Cave Swallow salvaged in Mississippi in
   spring is uncertain, Autumn specimens of the southwestern subspecies P
   fulva pallido are from North and South Carolina. Cave Swallows measured
   and photographed at Cliff Swallow (P pyrrhonota) breeding colonies in
   Arizona and Nebraska were P. f pallida, as well as one bird photographed
   at a Cliff and Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) colony in Louisiana along
   the Mississippi line. photographs of Cave Swallows in spring at
   California and in late autumn at New York were P. f. pallida. Subspecies
   could not be determined for six other records verified by photographs.
   Most of 46 sight observations of Cave Swallows have been reported at
   similar locations, seasons. and times as the verified records.
   Extralimital Cave Swallows in the United States and Canada have occurred
   along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and in {[}lie interior, especially
   during spring and late autumn. and extralimital occurrences in the 1999
   incursion matched the pattern in other years. The majority of birds on
   the Gulf coast occurred before the 1990s, mainly in spring, and on the
   Atlantic coast and in the interior during the 1990s, mainly in late
   autumn. The pattern of extralimital Occurrence is consistent with
   changes in the breeding and winter status of the two subspecies. In
   Texas, breeding and overwintering populations of P. f. pallida have
   rapidly increased since the mid 1980s, in contrast to the slight
   increase of breeding populations of P f. fulva in southeastern Florida.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is one of the most abundant
   shorebirds in northwestern Mexico however, little is known about its
   winter ecology ill this area. We, patterns of male Western Sandpipers
   during the winters of 1995-1996 (1995) and 1996-1997 (1996) at Estero
   Punta Banda in Baja California, Mexico. We resighted 54 birds in 1995
   and 56 birds in 1996, Birds arrived later in 1995 (median 1 December)
   than in 1996 (median 24 October). The median departure dates (6 March
   1996 and 20 February 1997) did not differ between years. We observed two
   patterns of residency, Wintering birds in 1995 arrived on 17 November
   (median) and departed on 17 March (,median), with length of stay of
   120.0 +/- 4.2 d; and in 1996 arrived on 12 October (median) and departed
   oil 8 March (median), with length of stay of 146.9 +/- 4.3 d. Transient
   birds in 1995 arrived on 7 December (median) and departed oil 17
   February (median), with stays of 33.7 +/- 4.3 d; and in 1996 arrived on
   23 October (median) and departed on 3 December (median), with stays of
   33.7 +/- 4.1 d. Residence time was independent of sighting effort. Both
   wintering birds and transients exhibited site fidelity between years.
   Both categories were independent with respect to age, trapping month, or
   Near. The mid-season departures were not correlated with either age or
   the banding period. Older birds were more likely to depart earlier and
   switch their residency pattern front wintering to transient. While the
   ecological significance of variation in residency patterns remains
   unknown, evidence from this and previous studies suggest that such
   variation may be relatively common, with important implications for
   studies of shorebird populations and conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of color bands on adult birds have been investigated in many
   studies, but much less is known about the effects of bands on birds
   handed at hatch. We captured Semi-palmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla)
   chicks at hatch on the Alaskan North Slope and attached 0-3 bands to
   them. The chicks were resighted and reweighed during the subsequent two
   weeks. The number of chicks banded varied from 18 to 21 among
   treatments; 6-9 were resighted, and 6-7 were reweighed, per treatment.
   The proportion resighted varied from 0.33 to 0.45. The estimated
   resighting probability, given that we encountered a brood. was 82\%. We
   tested for effects Of the bands on survival and mass gain by analyzing
   whether the proportion of chicks resighted, or their mass, varied with
   the number of bands. We found no evidence that bands affected the chicks
   and were able to rule out (with 95\% confidence) a decline in
   survivorship Of more than 13\% and a loss of mass of more than 10\%.
   Although bands had little if any effect on chicks in our study, we
   believe their effects should be evaluated whenever survivorship or mass
   gain atc estimated using color-marked chicks.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying productivity of bird populations often involves calculating
   nest success from samples of nests found during a breeding season.
   Female reproductive output (annual or lifetime) is important to
   demographic modeling of birds, but nest success is a poor metric to
   compare productivity. among areas or populations. Based on preliminary
   review, we hypothesized that avian literature poorly distinguishes
   annual reproductive success from nest success regardless of species'
   breeding strategies, and that the influence of renesting and Multiple
   brooding on Asian productivity is infrequently recognized. We
   investigated the reporting of nest success, annual reproductive success,
   renesting, and multiple brooding in 356 articles across 81 journal-years
   for nine journals that frequently publish ornithological literature. We
   found 54\% of 356 articles reporting productivity estimators used
   variations of nest success. However. only 10\% of articles reported
   estimates of annual reproductive output. We found that 28\% of articles
   reported the breeding strategy Of the species studied, and 47\%,
   acknowledged renesting or multi-brooded species. There was no temporal
   increase in acknowledgment of species' breeding strategy, renesting, or
   multi-brooding. Our review indicated little distinction between nest
   success and annual reproductive success. To accurately, support
   conservation evaluations, we believe use of nest success in assessing
   avian productivity must be critically examined.}},

Abstract = {{To learn more about mid-Pacific migration, we radio-tagged 40 Pacific
   Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis fulva) in spring 1999 on their wintering
   territories in Hawaii. The birds departed in late April. and with aerial
   monitoring we relocated 10 of them in Alaska. Seven individuals were in
   or near the Nushagak River lowlands in southwestern Alaska. Nesting
   Pacific Golden-Plovers were discovered there in 1994 disjunct from the
   previously known breeding range. The remaining three radio-tagged birds
   were found north of Bethel on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Our results
   Suggest that breeding is continuous from the Nushagak region west
   through the uplands north of Bristol Bay to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
   Thus, plovers wintering in Hawaii apparently nest across a wide area of
   Alaska. We present a revised Alaska breeding distribution map for the
   species which differs significantly from AOU Check-list boundaries. The
   temporary attachment of transmitters (they, are shed during summer
   molting) had no apparent effect or) survival within our sample
   population. Birds that had carried transmitters returned to their winter
   territories in Hawaii at a rate nearly identical to banded plovers not
   radio-tagged.}},

   Here we analyze Quebec checklist data from the breeding season for

   at frequently visited ({''}standard{''}) sites. Checklist trends from
   the breeding season For standard sites corresponded much more closely to
   magnitudes of BBS trends than checklist trends based on all sites,
   although in both cases, checklists accurately reflected direction of BBS
   trend in >80\% of species. Checklist trends from migration seasons for
   all sites and for standard sites were similar to each other. and did not
   correspond as well to BBS trends, probably because different populations
   were sampled in the two seasons. Checklist programs can be improved for
   population monitoring purposes by encouraging frequent reporting front
   standard sites, and by collecting recommended ancillary data that allow
   analysts to select data most appropriate to their research questions.}},

   the use of artificial mid-canopy nests and assessed corvid abundance
   using a variety of techniques including point-count surveys, transect
   surveys, and the broadcast of corvid territorial arid predator
   attraction calls. Point counts of corvid abundance had the strongest
   correlation with predation on artificial nests containing eggs. The
   relationship between nest predation rate and corvid abundance was
   strongest when study plots were used as replicated measures of landscape

Abstract = {{We assessed the effect of nest visits by researchers oil the activity of
   nest predators and predation rate of eggs in a High Arctic Greater Snow
   Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica) colony. The study was conducted in
   years of moderate (1996) and low (1997) overall nest predation rate, We
   first compared activity late (number of presences per It) and behavior
   of nest predators in the colony with and without investigator
   disturbance. In one year out of two, activity rate and time spent in the
   colony were higher during nest visits than under undisturbed conditions
   for Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus) and Parasitic Jaegers
   (Stercorarius parasiticus). Moreover, presence of investigators
   significantly increased (4.8 times) the probability of nest attack by
   predators in one Year. Nevertheless, the immediate revisit technique
   showed that the percentage of goose eggs robbed by predators in
   monitored nests was low (<0.7\%) during a nest visit. In addition, we
   found no significant difference in mean Clutch size at the end Of
   incubation or nesting success between nests that were visited repeatedly
   (8 visits) and those less disturbed (<3 visits), Although some predators
   can be attracted by and Lake advantage of the presence of investigators,
   our results indicate that nesting parameters estimated for this snow
   goose colony are not biased by nest visits. However, the effect of
   investigator disturbance could be more important in other arctic nesting
   bird species that are unable to successfully defend their nest against
   predators or when predation pressure is very high.}},

   multiple song types with immediate variety and song types are shared

   one subspecies of Mangrove Warbler (Dendroica petechia bryanti) to that
   of a widely studied Northern Yellow Warbler subspecies (D. p. aestiva).
   Songs from these two subspecies are significantly different in length

   analysis separates their songs entirely. These results, when taken

Abstract = {{We evaluated the magnitude of use of waste tips by Kelp Gulls (Larus
   dominicanus) nesting at Isla de los Pajaros, a large and growing colony
   in Patagonia, Argentina, and we assessed the difference in use between
   tips with urban and fishery waste. We marked with color dye 1347 adult
   breeding Kelp Gulls to determine if they fed in urban and fishery tips
   and to estimate the number of birds which used those tips during
   incubation. Kelp Gulls were present during 100\% and 64\% of counts at
   the fisher, waste tip and the urban waste tip. respectively. The number
   of adult gulls was always larger at the fishery waste tip (mean +/- SD =
   1694 +/- 664) than in the urban waste tip (mean +/- SD = 59 +/- 68).
   Considering the total number of gulls flying from the colony to the tips
   and the proportion of marked gulls in the tips, we estimated that at
   least 54-69\% of the birds of the colony were present at the tips. The
   use of fishery waste may have contributed to the increase in the number
   of Kelp Gulls breeding at Isla de los Pajaros, and the quality,
   abundance, and predictability of food disposed at the fishery waste tip
   could foster the use of this site relative to natural food sources
   located closer to their breeding colon,: Removal of artificial food
   sources may be assessed at the Puerto Madryn and other Paragonian waste
   tips to reduce conflicts between human and gull populations.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the use of three direct methods (fat scoring, condition
   indices, and multiple regression of external morphological variables) to
   estimate total body fat (TBF) in Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter
   striatus) and Cooper's Hawks (A. cooperii). All three methods explained
   more than 82\% of the variation in actual TBF values, and all three
   methods required the use of multiple equations to account for the
   categories of species, age, and/or srs. We also evaluated an indirect
   method that estimates TBF bu the difference between actual mass and
   estimated lean mass. We estimated lean mass using a multiple regression
   of external morphological variables, and this technique was fairly
   accurate (r = 0.94). The methods evaluated here, though reasonably
   precise, may not be accurate enough to reliably compare estimated TBF
   between individual birds. using multiple regression to directly estimate
   TBF from mass and tarsus length measurements is the recommended
   technique because (1) it provides continuous estimates of TBF: (2) it
   requires measuring only two external morphological characters, both of
   which are less subjective than fat scores; and (3) it is more
   explanatory than the other two methods which use external
   characteristics as predictors. Our results also suggest that comparing
   groups of birds using condition indices may yield misleading results
   because these indices can relate to TBF differently for species, age,
   and or sex classes.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying incubation patterns has often involved long observation
   periods in the field, video cameras, or the use of other electronic
   devices that sometimes require the partial destruction of clutches and
   insertion of artificial eggs. In this study: we used an inexpensive,
   nondestructive method involving temperature probes combined with data
   loggers to examine the incubation rhythm of female Black-throated Blue
   Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens). The method provided detailed records
   of on-off patterns fur females for selected 24-h periods during
   incubation. Female warblers spent an average (+/- SE) of 64.0\% of
   daylight hours incubating in bouts lasting 20.5 +/- 1.5 min and made 2.4
   +/- 0.1 departures from the nest/h on trips that lasted 10.6 +/- 0.7
   mill. incubation bouts were longer and females spent more time
   incubating per hour in the mornings and late afternoons than at mid-day.
   Older females had longer incubation bouts and tended to have shorter
   incubation periods than did yearling females, suggesting that
   experienced individuals were more effective incubators. Because of its
   ease of use and because nests with probes were not depredated at a
   higher rate than controls. we suggest that the temperature probe/data
   logger method is an efficient and effective way to quantify incubation
   rhythms for open-cup nesting birds.}},

Abstract = {{The study of birds killed at the WCTV television tower in north Florida
   over a 29-yr period is one of the longest of its kind. A total of 44,007
   individuals in 186 species was collected, and over 94\% of the total
   number of individuals were Neotropical migrants with the Red-eyed Vireo
   (Vireo olivaceous) the most frequent. Two factors changed during the
   study period: tower height and scavenger control. Analysis of these
   factors suggest that towers approximately 94 m or lower may not pose as
   great a threat of avian mortality as caused by towers 200 m or greater.
   Absence of scavenger control corresponded with a 71\% decline in the
   number of individuals found beneath the tower. Any study of avian
   mortality at communication towers must directly address the problem of
   removal of injured and dead birds by scavengers to make an accurate
   measure of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Of 233 Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis) banded as nestlings in three
   study areas of Montana over 16 years, 15 (6.4\%) were recovered.
   Recovery rate increased with duration of study and cumulative number
   banded. Mean age at recovery, for all Ferruginous Hawks banded in
   Montana was 390 days. Analysis indicated 50\% of banded hawks were dead
   by between 0.35 and 0.70 yr and 95\% were dead by between 1.5 and 3 yr
   of age. Survival estimated at one year was higher if hawks recovered by
   radio-tracking were excluded. Mean distance from the natal nest of all
   recoveries of Ferruginous Hawks banded in Montana was 824 km, Eight
   recoveries were of recently fledged hawks <1 km fr om the natal nest,
   but tftr remainder were recovered greater than or equal to 1500 km from
   the natal nest. Recoveries that were outside natal 10-minute blocks (n =
   7) occurred in northern Mexico, central New Mexico, southern California,
   and Texas; most (86\%) were southeast of the natal nest. Six hawks died
   front unknown causes. five from predation, two from conflicts with power
   lines or towers, and two from injuries. Predation occurred more often
   within than outside natal 10-minute blocks. Recovery locations suggested
   that breeding populations of Ferruginous Hawks remain segregated during
   winter. Mortality from electrocution and collision may be important for
   some populations, especially those that winter in populated areas of
   California and Mexico.}},

   close matches to the density estimated by intensive territory mapping of

   broods of varying sizes may receive different quantities of food for
   reasons not entirely related to the parental quality of the adults. To
   control for variation in brood size, researchers often divide feeding
   visitation rates by brood size to yield a per-nestling feeding rate.
   This presents problems, however, if adults adjust food load size in
   response to variation in blood size. We examined the relationship
   between brood size and parental care in the herbivorous House Finch
   (Carpodacus mexicanus) by considering not only visitation rates but also
   food load sites. As brood size increased, the overall visitation rate
   increased but both per-nestling visitation rate and per-nestling food
   load rate decreased. The relationship between brood size and
   per-nestling care was similar regardless of whether we considered
   visitation rate or actual food loads, suggesting that in the House Finch
   per-nestling visitation rate serves as a reasonable index of total mass
   of food received by the nestlings. However, we urge caution in assuming
   that per-nestling visitation rate is an adequate measure of parental
   care in other species.}},

Abstract = {{Hourly mass gain during migratory stopover in spring and fall was
   estimated for 48 species at three sites on Long Point, Ontario.
   Estimates were based on regression of size corrected mass at first
   capture on time of day. Mean mass gain for all species and sites in fall
   was 0.61\% of lean body mass/h, well over the mean estimated gain
   required to maintain daily energy balance (0.27\% of lean body mass/h).
   In spring, mass gain was 0.50\% of lean body mass/h at two sites but
   only 0.17\% at the extreme tip of Long Point, where cold lake
   temperature in spring probably affects insect abundance. While most
   species fared well in fall, thrushes did not, perhaps due to poor
   habitat for ground foraging on Long Point. Except for the eastern tip of
   Long Point in spring, the study sites compare favorably in mass gain to
   two other stations in the northern U.S. where similar analyses have been
   done.}},

Abstract = {{Scavenging of carcasses may bias estimates of mor talin following the
   use of pesticides. To assess carcass survival, we monitored bird
   carcasses in crop stubble, grassland, roadside, and wooded habitats in
   east-central South Dakota in earl! spring. Survival rates differed among
   habitat types in 1997 but not in 1998. Survival rates did nor differ
   among species of carcass in 1997 or 1998. Within 5 d, 66\% of carcasses
   had been scavenged in both 1997 and 1998. To assess potential hazards of
   secondary poisoning, we used infrared-triggered camera systems to
   identify predators and scavengers of live birds and bird carcasses.
   Mammals (n = 164), particularly striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) (n =
   105), were the most commonly photographed predator and scavengers. The
   number of avian predators and scavengers photographed (n = 39) was
   relatively low. Because scavenger activity call be high, we recommend
   that searches for carcasses should be conducted within 24 h of pesticide
   application to ensure accurate estimates of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The O'ahu `Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis) is an endangered
   monarch flycatcher endemic to the Hawaiian Island of O'ahu. One of the
   main causes of the decline of this forest bird is low nest success. This
   study investigated whether introduced rodents might be important nest
   predators in `Elepaio habitat by conducting artificial nest experiments
   before and during a rodent control program. In each experiment, 20
   artificial nests with two quail eggs each were placed on the ground and
   in trees, then checked at 5, 10, and 15 day intervals. The size,
   appearance, location, and odor of artificial nests were considered in
   order to make the experiment more realistic. Rodent control decreased
   predation on artificial tree and ground nests by 45\% and 55\%,
   respectively. Predation on ground nests was higher than predation on
   tree nests before rodent control, but afterwards predation was low on
   both ground and tree nests and did not differ between them. Survival of
   artificial tree nests after rodent control (80\%, 0.985 daily) was
   similar to survival through incubation of `Elepaio nests (82\%, 0.989
   daily), indicating the artificial nests provided a realistic measure of
   predation on `Elapaio nests. Automatic cameras wired to nests documented
   the identity of the predator in 10 events; in every case it was a black
   rat (Rattus rattus). Black rats appear to be the primary nest predator
   in O'ahu `Elepaio habitat, and rodent control is a valuable management
   technique that can he used to increase the reproductive success of
   `Elepaio.}},

   (Bubo virginianus) ht comparing data from 75 owl nests with data
   recorded at random sites derived from computer-generated map
   coordinates. The authors concluded that owl nests differed significantly
   from random sites for nearly all of the eight habitat variables that
   they measured. I consider some of these conclusions tentative because
   Smith et al. (1999) ignored the fact that owls do not build their own
   nests and thus are not free to nest wherever they choose. Although Smith
   et al.'s approach is adequate for assessing selection of some
   macrohabitat features, a more appropriate way to, assess nest-site
   selection per se would have been to compare characteristics of owl nests
   with those measured at a similar number of suitable but unused stick
   nests in the same study area where the owls nested.}},

Abstract = {{Marks (2001) is critical of our study of nest-site selection in Great
   Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) because we compared our data from owl
   nests with data from random points rather than from unused stick nests.
   We argue that Great Horned Owls have so many options for nesting in
   eastern forests that there is little constraint on nest-site selection.
   Therefore. their choice of nest sites is deter mined largely by
   vegetation characteristics in the surrounding landscape, and comparison
   of owl nests with random points is the best way to assess nest-sits
   selection. Furthermore, we believe that use of unused nests as controls,
   as advocated by Marks, is biased because control nests will have many of
   the same characteristics as nests used by owls.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1990s Agriculture Canada's Permanent Cover Program (PCP)
   converted over 445,000 ha of cropland to perennial vegetative cover. The
   wildlife benefits of the PCP have not been the subject of previous
   research. We conducted grassland bird surveys on 629 PCP sites and 564
   cropland sites across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba between 25 May
   and 3 July 1998. PCP sites showed higher avian species richness than
   cropland, and nine of 10 commonly detected grassland bird species
   occurred at higher frequencies in PCP than cropland. PCP sites were
   characterized by taller, denser vegetation and less bare ground than
   cropland sites. Hayed and grazed PCP sites differed significantly in
   their vegetative structure and avian community composition, but did not
   differ in species richness or evenness. Mean bird species richness at
   both cropland and PCP sites was significantly lower in the aspen
   parkland ecoregion than in the mixed and moist-mixed grassland
   ecoregions. Logistic regression identified 18 geographic and vegetative
   variables that significantly influenced the occurrence of individual
   species, but models for only two species predicted both presence and
   absence with greater than 50\% accuracy. Avian productivity on PCP lands
   must be determined to appraise definitively the quality of this habitat

Abstract = {{Studies on small wintering birds often monitor body mass variation over
   days or seasons. Typically, birds are weighed manually or data are
   obtained using an electronic balance which displays the bird's mass
   during visits to a feeder. The problem with these techniques is that
   they require the manipulation of the animals and/or are labor intensive.
   We built an automated system which combines a transponder-based radio
   identification device (RID) and an electronic balance fitted with a
   weighing perch. This setup permits daily mass variation in birds to be
   monitored automatically without human presence. The system provides
   reliable estimates of inert masses (r(2) = 1). We also used it to
   monitor bird masses in an aviary. For five days birds were caught
   periodically and weighed manually to measure their ``real{''} masses for
   comparison with the system's estimates. Again a strong relationship was
   found between calculated and real masses (r(2) = 0.92 and r(2) = 0.89
   using two different balances). This system offers great promise and
   could be adapted to many forms of field work.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behavior and resource use of four syntopic species of
   antwrens (Drymophila) was studied at Intervales State Park (24 degrees
   17'S, 48 degrees 25'W) in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest.
   Ochre-rumped Antbirds (D. ochropyga) foraged mainly by probing for
   arthropods in dead leaves. The Ferrugineous Antbird (D. ferruginea) and
   Bertoni's Antbird (D. rubricollis) gleaned or sallied for insects mainly
   on live foliage in bamboo tickets. Dusky-tailed Antbirds (D. malura)
   used many kinds of substrate such as live leaves, dead leaves or twigs,
   and tended to hang while gleaning insects from herbaceous vegetation.
   Foraging speed during prey search was significantly slower for D.
   ochropyga, whereas differences in attack rate among other species were
   not significant. Niche overlap was measured for 11 substrate-maneuver
   combinations; D. ferruginea and D. rubricollis had large overlap (82\%).
   Sympatric and syntopic coexistence of these four antwrens may be
   maintained by habitat and substrate specialization through exploitation
   of dead leaves and bamboo thickets.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted point counts three dines during the 1994 breeding season at
   48 stations across the northwestern United States, and used cumulative
   totals from the three visits to rank the sites by two potential indices
   of conservation value: species richness and overall abundance of birds.
   We then recalculated each of the indices (1) using data from only a
   single visit to each site and (2) using data from only two visits.
   Rankings based on only one or two visits revealed that eliminating one,
   and even two of the visits had relatively minor effects on species
   richness rankings but affected rankings based on overall abundance more
   substantially. We also evaluated how effectively one or two visits to
   each site detected particular species of management concern. We conclude
   that when resources are limited, species richness based on point counts
   conducted during just one ol two visits to potential conservation sites
   may provide a reliable index for prioritizing conservation efforts. When
   the primary objective is to determine the presence or absence of a
   particular species, however, at least two visits may be warranted.
   Finally, we conclude that, in general, researchers must be careful when
   using overall abundance as an index for establishing conservation
   priorities, as values may fluctuate substantially throughout the season.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of a banded population of American Goldfinches (Carduelis
   tristis) showed that frequencies of recaptured birds wearing at least
   one of nine different colored leg bands did not differ from expected
   frequencies over a 6-yr period. In a similar analysis, the likelihood of
   a bird becoming part of a local breeding population over a 4-yr period
   was independent of the color of its bands. For nine colors (yellow,
   orange, red, green, light blue, dark blue, black, pink, and white)
   analyzed separately, returning or breeding birds did not carry a
   particular color more often than expected. The use of colored leg bands
   in this breeding population did not appear to affect return or breeding
   frequencies of birds wearing at least one of a particular colored leg
   band. A trend towards returning and breeding males being less likely to
   carry a yellow band bears further study since yellow is the color of
   plumage characteristics associated with dominance during the nonbreeding
   season and mate choice in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Backpack radio-tags can be used to monitor survival of raptors for
   several years after fledging, but may reduce survival if a poor fit
   results from subjective judgments. We present an attachment method that
   can use bird measurements to predict harness sizes. Relationships
   between body mass of Saker Falcons and harness size predicted the size
   for smaller falcon species. Harnesses were fitted when birds had reached
   full size in the nest, which required age estimation at a previous visit
   to predict a fledging date. Equations based on wing length provided
   objective aging of nestlings. A pump-pressured water gun aided capture
   of young falcons and toggle-loops restrained the feet during marking.
   Saker Falcons with radio-tags and others marked only with leg bands and
   implanted transponders had the same recapture rate (7\%) in autumn,
   indicating similar survival. This retrap rate should be adequate to
   estimate harvest rates and population sizes for Saker Falcons.}},

Abstract = {{The little-known Pale-mandibled Aracari is endemic to wet forests of
   western Ecuador. I quantified population density, feeding ecology,
   reproductive biology, and vocalizations. Population density in the study
   area was one group (nine individuals) per 333 ha. They were observed to
   consume fruits of 34 species of plants, of which Lauraceae and Palmae
   were the most important. Pale-mandibled Aracaris fed their young fruits
   from at least eight species of plants, insects from five orders, adult
   and nestling birds, and bird eggs. Nests were made in cavities within
   live trees, typically Carapa guianensis, and clutches consisted of at
   least two eggs. At one nest, incubation lasted approximately 17 d.
   Nestling care in one nest lasted at least 44 d, and was shared by the
   female, the male and at least one helper. Pale-mandibled Aracaris
   roosted in groups of up to seven individuals, Ninety-five percent of
   primary forest in the range of this species had been cut by 1988, and
   less than 1\% of its original habitat lies within protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{We gathered data on the habitat and general characteristics of 24 nest
   mounds (14 active, 10 inactive) of Micronesian Megapodes (Megapodius
   laperouse senex) in the Palau Islands of western Micronesia. Most (92\%)
   mounds were found in strand forests near beaches. Active mounds in this
   habitat were composed mostly of sand and averaged (+/- SD) 108.8 +/-
   20.6 cm in height, 6.2 +/- 0.7 m in width, and 7.3 +/- 1.2 m in length
   (n = 10). In contrast, mounds in uplands were made of organic matter and
   were smaller in size (82.0 +/- 17.0 cm in height, 3.6 +/- 0.4 m in
   width, and 3.7 +/- 0.6 m in length; n = 2). Mounds were usually located
   at the bases of one to three large live trees. Historic and current
   patterns of megapode distribution and abundance in Palau correspond well
   with the distribution of strand forests in the archipelago, suggesting
   that the species' occurrence is linked with this habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Gadwalls (Anas strepera) hatched at Mono Lake, California, exhibit two
   types of severe foot damage, one manifested by the formation of hard
   white nodules on the plantar surface, the other by necrosis, which
   results in deformed and eroded webs and, in extreme cases, loss of
   podotheca and toes. Unknown in Gadwalls elsewhere or in other waterbirds
   at Mono Lake, these conditions may be evident in ducklings only three
   weeks old. They presumably stem from infections incurred after ducklings
   abrade their feet on the harsh lake substrate. The causative agent(s) is
   unknown.}},

Abstract = {{We studied survival immediately after banding of Greater Snow Geese
   (Chen caerulescens atlantica) captured in mass banding drives on Bylot
   Island (Nunavut, Canada) during the late brood-rearing period. Shortly
   after release, the banding sites and the surrounding areas were checked
   for dead banded birds. Logistic regression was used to model
   post-banding survival in relation to mass and age at banding, size of
   catch, banding year, and their interactions. Between 1993 and 1996, 6577
   adults and 6736 juveniles were banded, of which 6 adults and 192
   juveniles (goslings) were found dead. Apparent survival immediately
   after banding was high for juveniles (0.971 +/- 0.002) and close to 1.00
   for adults. The post-banding survival of juveniles decreased with catch
   size and increased with mass at banding, although the magnitude of the
   latter effect varied among years. Age at banding also affected survival
   in interaction with banding year and catch size. Post-banding survival
   was lowest for the youngest goslings captured in the largest catches in
   some years. Our analysis suggests that banding has a negligible effect
   on post-banding survival of juvenile snow geese when catch size does not
   exceed 600 individuals and goslings are heavier than 1400 g or older
   than 34 d, and has virtually no effect on adults.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Although the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is a significant insect pest
   of eastern deciduous forests in the United States, relatively little is
   known about its effects on forest bird communities. We used six Breeding
   Bird Census sites from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to assess
   changes in bird species richness and individual species density in the
   years surrounding a gypsy moth outbreak. Individual species' responses
   were variable among states, and only a few species showed consistent
   responses to outbreaks across sites. Yellow-billed Cuckoos (Coccyzus
   americanus) and Black-billed Cuckoos (C. erythropthalmus) appeared two
   years prior to an outbreak and then disappeared immediately after an
   outbreak on four of the sites and increased in numbers on another site.
   Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), which are usually associated with
   open habitat, increased temporarily after outbreaks and then returned to
   pre-outbreak densities within 5 yrs after the outbreak. At the community
   or guild level, there was a significant reduction in species associated
   with closed-canopy forests during the outbreak year(s) compared with the
   average of all other years (before and after the outbreak). There were
   no other general responses by the avian communities to the outbreaks,
   including associations with habitat preference, foraging guild, or
   nesting substrate. This study suggests that the effects of gypsy moth
   defoliation on the avian community are likely to be short-term (assuming
   that tree mortality is not severe) and spatially variable. The minimal
   nature of these effects also suggests that compared with pesticide
   options for gypsy moth control, allowing the gypsy moth to defoliate,
   when feasible, is preferable when managing for forest birds.}},

Abstract = {{Although significant numbers of the federally endangered Red-cockaded
   Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) occur at military installations, little
   research has been initiated to determine what effects military
   activities have on the birds. From 1994-1996 we collected data at Ft.

   selected military activities on reproductive success of the birds. Noise
   and vibration levels were recorded at or directly adjacent to active
   woodpecker clusters that received significant use by the military on a
   regular basis (i.e., firing of small arms and artillery). Identical data
   were collected at active clusters that were not normally used by
   military personnel and that we perceived to be relatively free of such
   disturbances. Surprisingly, we found no significant differences in noise
   or vibration levels between treatments and controls. There also were no
   significant differences between treatment and control sites with regard
   to the numbers of eggs, nestlings, adults, return rates of adults
   feeding young, or masses of nestlings and adults. Habitat assessments
   revealed no differences in basal area or midstory density; however,
   understory was significantly more pronounced at treatment sites.}},

Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Use of coastal beaches by nonbreeding shorebirds along the Pacific coast
   of North America is poorly understood because survey efforts have
   targeted large bays and wetlands where birds concentrate. Consequently;
   we studied coastal shorebird distributions and community composition by
   conducting monthly surveys at 40, 0.5-km linear plots along sandy
   beaches of coastal northern California from January through April 1996.
   We recorded 12 species, whose ranked abundances were consistent between
   winter (January-February) and spring (March-April). However, five of the
   six commonest species were more abundant in winter than spring. Among
   beaches, we detected a mean of 2.6 +/- 2.3 (SD; range: 0-9) species and
   12.0 +/- 14.1 (range: 0-62) individuals. Number of species correlated
   positively with total shorebird abundance. Most species abundances
   varied greatly among sites; nine taxa had aggregated spatial
   distributions, one species was hyper-dispersed, and two species were
   randomly distributed among beaches. Species composition of the shorebird
   community was highly nested, partly because abundant species were more
   widespread in their occurrence than less-numerous taxa. More species and
   individuals occurred at sites near Humboldt Bay; probably because high
   tides forced birds off their principal feeding areas within the bay to
   adjacent beaches. Variation in shorebird use of beaches suggests that
   some areas are more important to wintering and migrating shorebirds than
   other locations. Although current levels of human activity in coastal
   northern California do not appear to influence distributions of
   nonbreeding shorebirds, we suggest that monitoring and management plans
   be considered to minimize potential negative impacts of recreational
   activities, which are certain to increase with human population size and
   recreational use of beaches.}},

Abstract = {{Farallon de Medinilla is a small island in the western Pacific that is
   leased by the U.S. military from the Commonwealth of the Northern
   Mariana Islands as an impact area for training exercises. We spent 5.5 h
   on the island surveying its avifauna on 4 Nov. 1996 and observed a total
   of 17 species including seabirds, migratory shorebirds, and resident
   landbirds. Of special interest was the first island record of the
   endangered Micronesian Megapode (Megapodius laperouse) and breeding
   colonies of Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) and Masked Boobies (Sula
   dactylatra). Locations of individual megapodes and seabird colonies were
   mapped and breeding information recorded. Historical records and
   photographs indicate that since the island has been used as an impact
   area its vegetative structure has changed fi om a medium-height,
   relatively closed canopy forest, to primarily open areas with
   intermittent patches of low forest. Alterations of native vegetation
   likely resulted in changes in the density, distribution, and species
   composition of the island's avifauna, although these changes are
   difficult to quantify.}},

Abstract = {{Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) nest were both clumped (high density) and
   solitary (low density) at Windermere Basin, Lake Ontario in 1992. Our
   objective was to measure egg fate and chick survival up to 14-16 d of
   pairs nesting in these two dispersion patterns. We first measured the
   distance to nearest neighbor for 100 randomly selected clutches, and
   defined low-density nests as those at a distance greater than 2 SD (m)
   away from the nearest clutch. Two sites contained nests at high density
   (HD1 \& HD2), while low density nests (LD) were dispersed throughout the
   study site. We randomly selected 20, three-egg clutches in each of the
   three groups. Nearest neighbor distances of HD1 (1.08 +/- 0.71 m) and
   HD2 (2.09 +/- 1.03 m) clutches were similar and significantly different
   from nearest neighbor distances of LD clutches (21.9 +/- 37.3 m). There
   were no differences ill clutch initiation dates or C-egg volumes among
   the 60 clutches of the three study groups. LD and HD1 clutches
   experienced heavy egg and subsequent chick loss, while losses of eggs
   and chicks at HD2 were negligible. The evidence for type of predator was
   largely circumstantial, but for eggs that were destroyed and chicks that
   disappeared, the loss patterns suggested primary predation by Ruddy
   Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and Black-crowned Night-Herons
   (Nycticorax nycticorax), respectively. The locations and timing of egg
   and chick losses indicates that opportunistic behavior of these avian
   predators nullifies any predatory avoidance advantages of high-density
   nesting once the predator(s) identify the food resource.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the accuracy of 50-m fixed-radius, 100-m
   fixed-radius, and variable circular-plot point counts to estimate the
   actual density of breeding Cerulean Warblers (Dendroica cerulea) during
   the 1997 and 1998 breeding seasons, in Ontario, Canada. Density
   estimates were compared to actual densities as measured from intensive
   field observation of pairing and nesting behavior. Estimates of density
   from each of the techniques were positively correlated with actual
   density in both years. Both the technique used to census a population as
   well as the actual density of the population itself affected the
   accuracy of the derived density estimations. In both years, the 50-m
   fixed-radius technique overestimated density. In contrast, the 100-m
   fixed-radius technique and variable circular-plot technique
   underestimated density; the degree of the underestimate of the 100-m
   fixed-radius increased as actual density increased. There was no
   correlation between the degree of underestimation and actual density for
   the variable circular-plot technique. Although all three methodologies
   provide relative measures of density, the variable circular-plot
   technique provides the best absolute assessment of Cerulean Warbler
   density and is considered most suitable fur broadscale surveys.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a technique for setting mist nets horizontally from canopy
   platforms, detailing materials needed, installation, and use of the net
   system. Using a control cold, the operator pulls the net outward from
   the platform along a cable, and rolls it inward around a
   manually-operated spindle to remove captured birds. Because nets are not
   raised from the ground, disturbance to vegetation is minimized. Set-up
   time averaged 5 min/net after climbing to the platform, and we used a
   maximum of two nets from a platform. High winds (>40 km/h) and light
   rain closed canopy nets more often than ground nets, and canopy nets
   were less effective before leaf-out in spring. In 1751 net-hours, 121
   birds of 25 species were captured, and 14 birds (27\%) were recorded
   escaping the nets. The method seeks to parallel conventional netting so
   as to allow comparisons between strata, making this technique useful for
   studies that require simultaneous mist-netting in forest canopy and
   understory levels.}},

   size of the plot, duration at the plot, and number of plots were varied,
   one variable at a time. A total of 459 individuals of 24 species was
   recorded on 18 plots sampled for a maximum of 10 min with unlimited
   distance. When increasing either the plot size, sampling length, or
   number of plots, the number of species detected increased at a
   decreasing rate, but without reaching an asymptote. The estimated
   density decreased with increasing plot size, increased with sampling
   length, and did not change with increasing plot number. However, the
   precision substantially improved. riots of 40-m radius counted for 10
   min detected 78\% of the species found in larger plots and rendered an
   overall bird density of 34 individuals/ha, almost twice as many as the
   only comparable study found. On average, more than 75\% of all species
   detected were within 40 In of the observers, using a 4-min sampling
   period at five plots. The migrant omnivorous flycatcher Elaenia albiceps
   was the most abundant species (22\% of total counts), followed by the
   hummingbird Sephanoides galeritus, the tapaculo Scelorchilus rubecola,
   the treecreeper Aphrastura spinicauda, and the parakeet Enicognathus
   ferrugineus. These species, which ir ere the most common in other
   studies conducted in similar temperate South American forests, showed
   species-specific responses to changes in the sampling variables.}},

Abstract = {{I provide a detailed description of an arthropod sampling technique,
   ``branch clipping,{''} and evaluate its efficacy in measuring food
   availability for three foliage-gleaning migratory warbler species
   wintering in Jamaica. I incorporated foraging observations into the
   sampling protocol to facilitate a match between the distribution of
   branch-clip samples and the distribution of warbler foraging attacks
   over available microhabitats. Where the match was imprecise, I weighted
   blanch clip samples accordingly. Foraging observations indicated that
   most for-aging maneuvers used by the warblers were directed at pre),
   located on foliage, which are likely to be well sampled by branch
   clipping. Published diet analyses permitted the elimination of prey taxa
   and sizes that were not eaten by the warblers, and suggested that nearly
   all of the items eaten were captured by branch clipping.
   Habitat-specific warbler attack rates, which can be used as independent
   evaluations of food availability measurements, closely matched prey
   density as estimated by branch clips across three habitat types (citrus
   orchard, coffee plantation, and dry limestone forest). These data
   suggest that branch clipping effectively measured food availability for
   foliage-gleaning warblers in Jamaica. The method is probably also well
   suited for other foliage-gleaning species, particularly in habitats and
   seasons in which birds feed largely on prey residing oil or flying near
   leaf surfaces. Branch clipping is probably ill suited for species that
   feed heavily on either large, fast filing insects (e.g., Odonata), or on
   large masses of flies (e.g., Chilonomidae) that seldom land on forest
   foliage.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted roadside and trail-side point count surveys to determine
   whether grassland bird abundance differs along ditched and non-ditched
   sampling points in southwestern Saskatchtewan. Savannah and Vesper
   Sparrows were more abundant along roads, while Baird's Sparrows,
   Chestnut-collared Longspurs, and Sprague's Pipits were more abundant
   along trails. Clay-colored Sparrows, Horned Larks, and Western
   Meadowlarks were detected equally along roads and trails. The lower
   abundance of Sprague's Pipits along roads ma) be attributed to the
   20-30\% reduction of suitable habitat associated with the road
   right-of-way within a point count of 100-m radius. Larger differences
   for Baird's Sparrows and Chestnut-collared Longspurs (42 and 56\% less
   abundant along roads, respectively suggest that these species tend not
   to establish territories adjacent to roadside ditches. Our results
   indicate that roadside studies designed to estimate the abundance of
   grassland songbirds should either include trailside counts or interpret
   roadside data based on the affinity of a species for roadside habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a 2-yr study of the nestling diet of Red-cockaded
   Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) at three locations to determine how it
   varied among sites. We photographed 5939 nest visits by adult
   woodpeckers delivering food items for nestlings. In 1994, we located
   cameras near three nest cavities on the Lower Coastal Plain of South
   Carolina and near two cavities at the Savannah River Site, which is on
   the Upper Coastal Plain. In 1995, cameras were installed on the Savannah
   River Site and in the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, Georgia. The
   cameras recorded activity bringing 33 different types of food to
   nestlings. Wood roaches (Blattoidea, Blattellidae, Parcoblatta spp.)
   were the most common food composing 50\% of the diet overall. They were
   also the most common prey at each location and for all but one of the
   woodpecker groups studied. Wood roaches were recorded in 26\% of the
   visits photographed on the Lower Coastal Plain and 62\% of the nest
   visits on the Upper Coastal Plain in 1994. In 1995, wood roaches were
   recorded in 57\% and 50\% of the visits on the Upper Coastal Plain and
   Piedmont, respectively. Woodpeckers on the Lower Coastal Plain used
   blueberries (Vaccinum sp.) and sawfly larvae (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae,
   Neodiprion sp.), two dietary items not commonly used at the other
   locations. Adults at two locations providing snail shells to nestlings
   possibly as an additional source of calcium. Morista's index of diet
   overlap (C) ranged from 0.04 to 0.99 for breeding males and females in
   the same group, from 0.63 to 0.99 among groups at the same location, and
   from 0.68 to 0.96 among locations. Because diet overlap of Red-cockaded
   Woodpecker nestlings at different geographical locations was within the
   range that occurred among group at the same location, we conclude that
   nestling diets are similar across the Geographical area studied, and
   that it varies little from year to year.}},

Abstract = {{We modified a figure-8 leg-loop harness designed for small passerines to
   attach successfully 1.8-g radio transmitters over the synsacrum of
   migrant Soras (Porzana carolina). Because of the short caudal region of
   Soras, addition of a waist loop was critical to securing the transmitter
   while leg loops were maintained to center the package. Thin gauge
   (0.6-mm diameter) elastic thread proved ideal for transmitter attachment
   and allowed for freedom of movement and girth expansion associated with
   fattening during a 6-10-wk stopover. Of 110 Soras radio tagged during
   three field seasons, only a single mortality was observed and only a
   single bird last its transmitter. Migration from the study area was
   confirmed for 76 (69\%) and suspected for another 25 birds (total 92\%).}},

Abstract = {{Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) reproduction and
   turnover (when an owl died or shifted territories, and was replaced by
   another owl) were monitored at 51 locations on Simpson Timber Company
   lands, northwestern California, from 1991-1995. We tested for
   differences in proportions of five stand age classes and reproductive
   success between Sported Owl pair sites with (greater than or equal to 1
   turnover) and without turnovers. Owl pairs at sites without turnovers
   fledged more young, showed more consistent reproductive success, and
   were surrounded by a greater percentage of 21-40-yr-old stands than were
   owl pairs at sires with turnovers. We hypothesize that pairs with high
   mate fidelity and survival were more reproductively successful because
   those pairs had previous breeding experience together. By investigating
   turnover along with habitat features, we now have an indication of the
   relative quality of various habitats for Spotted Owls on managed,

Abstract = {{Managing for the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis)
   on federal lands requires burning large tracts of mature pine forests
   every 3-5 yr. Many cavity trees that serve as potential nest sites for
   primary and secondary hole-nesting birds are destroyed by fire. We
   assessed the efficacy of a nest box program for the Great Crested
   Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) at Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife
   Refuge, an area intensively managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. During
   1996-1998, we installed and monitored 330 (30 in each of 11 sites) nest
   boxes in mature (>60 yr) longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) tracts that
   were burned either in April-June (warm season) or December-March (cool
   season). Prescribed-burned, sites were nearly devoid of snags; we
   estimated only 0.8/ ha in cool-season burns and 1.7/ha in warm-season
   burns. Great Crested Flycatchers built nests in 20\% of the boxes
   available to them. Clutch sizes were larger in warm-season burns than in
   cool-season burns, but fledging success (fledglings/nest hatching
   greater than or equal to 1 egg) was lower. Twenty-two of 59 Great
   Crested Flycatcher nests were depredated and the proportions in each
   burn class were similar. We recommend the installation of nest boxes for
   Great Crested Flycatchers in prescribed-burned pine forests, but
   additional research is needed in these habitats on nest depredation
   rates and causes.}},

Abstract = {{The nonindigenous Eurasian Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) most
   likely invaded southeastern Florida from the Bahamas in the early 1980s
   and had established a breeding population in Dade County by 1982, In the
   decade after its arrival in Florida, the Eurasian Collared-Dove
   dispersed northward, initially along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and
   established local populations throughout the state. By 1996, the species
   was recorded at 46 (82\%) of 56 localities surveyed on the Christmas
   Bird Count in Florida. The strong dispersal capability of the Eurasian
   Collared-Dove, which was documented during its colonization of Europe in
   the mid-1900s, suggests that rapid colonization of North America by the
   species is highly probable. Populations established in Texas and North
   Carolina during the early 1990s may be products of dispersal of doves
   from Florida. The species presents two potential biological threats to
   native avifauna: competition for resources and transmission of diseases.}},

Abstract = {{While testing a commercially manufactured wildlife video system, we
   developed a method for using this technology to monitor, continuously
   the reproductive behaviors of wild birds during rile nesting period. Two
   passerine bird nests, Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and
   Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), were monitored using
   miniature video cameras at thr nests. Cameras were connected to a 24-h
   time-lapse video recorder located up ro 18 m from each nest. System
   installation required approximately 20 min and nests were monitored for
   20 and 15 d, respectively. Significant events recorded on videotape
   included: egg laying, incubation, egg hatching, nestling rearing,
   fledging, mammalian depredation of inviable eggs after fledging, and
   reptilian depredation of nestlings prior to fledging. This technology
   reliably provided a highly detailed, non-intrusive means of observing
   nesting behavior and predation events equally well during da! and night
   operations and under extreme environmental conditions. Each commercially
   manufactured video system and associated equipment used in this study
   cost approximately US \$4000.}},

Abstract = {{Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) nests (n = 415) were monitored to
   completion on an expansive alkaline flat in north-central Oklahoma in
   1995-1996. We reported Mayfield Method nesting success but relied on
   apparent nesting success to compare differences in successful (hatched)
   and lost (depredated/flooded) nests in five 1000-ha areas, by
   microhabitat type, and inside versus outside electric-fence predator
   exclosures. Apparent nesting success differed by area in 1996 and over
   both years. Predation differed by area only in 1995, and flooding did
   not differ by area. Apparent nesting success and predation differed by
   microhabitat type in 1995 and over both years. Differences were observed
   among depredated and flooded nests inside versus outside electric-fence
   predator exclosures. Canids and gulls were primary predators. Nests
   associated with habitat improvements (1995) and near driftwood debris
   (1996) encountered higher predation, and nests near driftwood debris
   were more susceptible to flooding both years. We identified an area on
   the alkaline flat with the highest nesting success and lowest predation
   where future conservation efforts for Charadriiformes could be
   implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The Red-cockaded Woodpecker population in Louisiana suffered massive
   habitat loss in the early 1900s resulting from Large-scale clearcutting.
   We examined post-harvest aerial photographs of Fort Polk, Louisiana,
   from the 1930s to determine the extent of remnant forest and compared
   these remnants to current Red-cockaded Woodpecker clusters.
   Additionally, descriptive data-age, dbh, location-were gathered for all
   cavity trees within our study areas. Analysis of the photographs made it
   clear that the harvesting of the 1920s did not completely denude the
   landscape: trees remained in dense stands along streams and in scattered
   groups on some upland sites. These remnant trees corresponded to current
   woodpecker nest sites: on the two study areas, 84\% and 100\% of
   woodpecker clusters in 1997 were located on sites that contained trees
   from the 1930s. Over half of the current cavity trees on one site and
   over three quarters on the other sire are remnant trees which survived
   the clearcutting. Those trees are the foundation of the habitat
   available to the Red-cockaded Woodpecker population on the sites today.
   and based on the nesting habits of this bird, the remnants probably
   provided the needed habitat to support a continuous or near-continuous
   Red-cockaded woodpecker population in the area through the post-harvest
   recovery period and up to the present day.}},

Abstract = {{We summarize data on the breeding biology (based on seven nests) of the
   White-tailed Sabrewing (Campylopterus ensipennis; Trochilidae) at
   Tobago, West Indies. Breeding occurred during the dry season
   (February-April). Nests were placed 1.75-11 m high in small dicot trees,
   bamboo and palms in the forest interior, usually near streams. Two white
   eggs were laid in bulky (7-35-cm high), cup-shaped nests: one nest
   contained spines from a palm (Bactris sp.). The camouflaged nestlings
   were quiet. During the late nestling period, a female made 1.27 feeding
   trips/h (10.25 h of observation) to the nest; feeding sessions averaged
   0.93 min with an average of 2.0 regurgitations/nesting, and recesses off
   the nest averaged 44.26 min. The female fed on arthropods and nectar,
   and rigorously defended the nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Bill measurement is important in many feeding studies. Traditionally,
   two alternative bill measures have been proposed: bill length measured
   from the tip to skull (i.e., total culmen), mainly used in Europe, and
   bill length measured from the tip to the anterior edge of nostrils, used
   both in Europe and America. However, the correlation between both
   measures as well as the analysis of what they are in fact measuring have
   not been explored yet. The aim of this paper is to test in the Citril
   Finch (Serinus citrinella) whether measurement of bill length from the
   tip to the anterior edge of nostrils and total culmen are measuring
   different components of bill length (e.g., ramphotheca vs. premaxilla),
   and to assess which is the best measure in relation to their measurement
   error. This is specially relevant in granivorous birds for which total
   culmen length differs from ramphotheca length. The correlation between
   bill length to nostrils and total culmen was moderate (r = 0.75).
   Multiple regression of total culmen (dependent variable) on the bill
   components included ramphotheca length (R-2 = 52\%) and marginally
   premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2 change = 6\%, P = 0.06). When using
   bill length to nostrils as dependent variable it also included
   ramphotheca length (R-2 = 60\%) and premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2
   change = 16\%, P 0.001). Measurement error was low for bill length to
   nostrils (ME = 1.6\%) but high for total culmen (ME = 26.3\%), making
   the latter measure not reliable. The replicability of total culmen is
   probably decreased in granivorous birds, compared to other passerines,
   by the fact that in these species the abrupt edge of the ramphotheca
   differs from the point at which the culmen meets the skull, which
   hinders the location of the end of culmen. All of this highly recommends
   that, specially in granivorous birds, the length of bill should be
   measured from nostril. Our results also show that both bill length
   measures are mainly measuring ramphotheca.}},

Abstract = {{Incidental to a study of the breeding biology of other cavity-nesting
   species, we obtained data on an Apical Flycatcher (Myiarchus apicalis)
   female that remained for 6.5 yr (September 1990-February 1997) in the
   same area in the Cauca Valley, southwestern Colombia. The female was
   banded in September 1990, when incubating a two-egg clutch. Between
   September 1990 and April 1991 she made four nesting attempts, three of
   which were successful and produced eight young. Our work had two
   interruptions, but the female was recorded in the same pasture in 1993,
   1995, and 1997, and we assume she remained there all the time. All nests
   were built in nest boxes, and were lined with fur, feathers, snake skin,
   and pieces of plastic, a typical trait of Myiarchus flycatchers. Mean
   clutch size was 2.6 eggs. The nestling period was 16-17 d, and
   fledglings left the nest at 80\% of adult body mass.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, we discovered a population of the poorly known and critically
   endangered White-winged Nightjar (Caprimulgus candicans) in Yata'i
   (Butia paraguayensis) palm cerrado at the Mbaracayu Forest Nature
   Reserve, Paraguay. We provide the first description of the dislay of C.
   candicans, as observed in December 1995. The display, which appears to
   function primarily for mate attraction, took place in small arenas and
   consisted of a regular flight pattern between perches. Noises that
   accompany the display appear to be mechanical in origin. The modified
   shape of the outer remiges of male C. candicans suggests a role in the
   production of this display noise. Male territories were situated
   exclusively on the upper slopes of ridges in open grassland with a low
   palm density (termed campo sucio). Territories appeared to be relatively
   clustered, thus suggesting either a lek-mating system or male
   aggregation due to the use of specialized habitats as encounter sites
   for mating. Improved knowledge of the species behavior, breeding
   systems, and habitat use will facilitate its location at other sites and
   the development of habitat-based conservation management plans.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated the: annual population of Western Sandpipers (Calidras
   mauri) and Dunlin ( Calidris alpina pacifica) stopping over on the
   Copper River Delta during peak spring migration 1992-1995. Our
   calculations required four components: total daily shorebird numbers,
   the daily proportion of each species, average length of stay, and the
   detection probability. For the 21-d period 26 April-16 May, annual
   population estimates for Western Sandpiper ranged from 1.2-4.1 million
   birds per year. Dunlin estimates for this same period ranged from
   0.3-0.9 million. For both species, numbers were highest in 1993 and
   lowest in 1994. Power analysis determined that 15 yr of aerial surveys
   are needed to detect a 10\% decline in Western Sandpiper numbers. Based
   on the proportion of birds in the Pacific Flyway stopping over on the
   Copper River Delta, we estimated the Western Sandpiper Pacific Flyway
   population was >2.8 million in 1992 and >4.3 million in 1995. These data
   indicate that the Copper River Delta continues to support the largest
   spring concentration of shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere.}},

Abstract = {{During April-July 1997, we censused birds in three woodlands near
   Arnprior, Ontario, Canada using conventional point counts (n = 12) and
   point counts supplemented with ``pishing{''} (n = 12), a well-known
   method for attracting various bird species. Overall, 3.6 (19\%) more
   species were detected per census using pishing. Irrespective of
   statistical significance of individual species, 45 (74\%) of the 61
   species were detected on more days using pishing, whereas 5 (8\%)
   species were detected on more days using the conventional method. A
   higher number of males and a higher number of visually detected species
   were recorded using pishing as compared to the conventional method, and
   these differences did not change with date. Fishing did not affect
   number of females detected nor number of species aurally detected. More
   individuals were detected using pishing as opposed to the conventional
   method, but the difference declined with date. Overall, 0.8 fewer
   unidentified individuals per census were recorded using pishing. Our
   results indicate that pishing in conjunction with conventional point
   count methods increases detectability and positive visual identification
   of passerine species in woodlands.}},

   form a foundation for the nest cup, at the mouth of the cavity
   effectively decreasing the size of the entrance, and outside the nest
   cavity as if in a pathway. Eggs implanted with thermocouples provided
   records of egg temperature from which the females' incubation patterns
   were determined. Females roosted in the nest cavity and began diurnal
   incubation 3 days after beginning the clutch. Constancy of incubation
   was 71.0\%, and mean egg temperature during full-time incubation was
   34.4 C. Diurnal attentive bouts lasted a mean of 45.2 min and

   the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We tested for differences in
   nest survival throughout the breeding season and throughout the: nesting
   cycle. We compared the Mayfield cumulative survival curve with a
   modified version of the Kaplan-Meier with staggered entry. In addition,
   we compared the group of nests found during nest initiation with those
   found later in the nesting cycle. There was no evidence nest survival
   varied through the breeding season or with different stages of the
   nesting cycle. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve agreed with
   the Mayfield calculation. We found no evidence of heterogeneity.
   Validation of Mayfield assumptions is important because the method is
   widely used, allows for statistical comparisons, and is critical for
   estimating seasonal fecundity in bird populations.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal abundance of Neartic shorebirds in the Gulf of Maranhao,
   Brazil, was studied by censusing three sites from April 1991-March 1992.
   Censusing was conducted on Cajual Island and Panaquatira Beach at 15-d
   intervals and at 30-d intervals on Raposa Beach. Bird movements were
   analyzed by comparing census data from the Gulf of Maranhao with those
   presented by McNeil (1970) for northeastern Venezuela and by Spaans
   (1978) for Surinam. During fall migration, there were marked
   similarities in the abundance peaks of short-billed Dowitchers
   (Limnodromus griseus) and Willets ( Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) in both
   Surinam and the Gulf of Maranhao, which might indicate that these
   species reach these sites by non-stop flight across the Atlantic.
   Sanderlings (Calidris alba), Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius
   semipalmatus), Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres), Black-bellied
   Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris
   pusilla), and Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) reached their fall peak much
   later in Maranhao than in Surinam. which suggests that these species
   reach the Guyana coast first, migrating later to the Gulf of Maranhao.
   During northward migration, Willets and Whimbrels did not show a spring
   migration peak in the Gulf of Maranhao, whereas a spring migration peak
   was recorded in Surinam, which suggests a route to the Guyana coast and
   from there across the Atlantic Ocean to North America. Red Knots
   (Calidrus canutus). Sanderlings, Ruddy Turnstones and Black-bellied
   Plovers all had spring migration peaks in the Gulf of Maranhao,
   suggesting some transoceanic flight of these species from the Maranhao
   coast to North America. Semipalmated Plovers and Short-billed Dowitchers
   showed a small spring migration peak in the Gulf of Maranhao. whereas no
   migration peak was observed for Semipalmated Sandpiper. This suggests
   that these species start their movements towards the northernmost
   portion of South America earlier.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the growth of late-hatched, competitively disadvantaged
   nestlings to that of their first-hatched, larger nestmates in 12
   asynchronously hatching broods in a Wyoming population of House Wrens
   (Troglodytes aedon). Upon hatching, late-hatched nestlings weighed, on
   average, 48\% as much as their heaviest nestmate (range 38-60\%).
   Late-hatched nestlings gained significantly less mass per day (0.23 g,
   on average) than first-hatched nestmates between the ages of 3 and 7
   days when mass gain is most rapid. Late-hatched nestlings also showed a
   strong tendency to grow tarsi more slowly than first-hatched nestmates
   over the same time period (mean difference: 0.16 mm/d). Primary feathers
   of late-hatched nestlings, however grew slightly but not significantly
   more slowly those of first-hatched nestmates (mean difference: 0.05
   mm/d). Reduced rates of mass gain and tarsus growth but normal rates of
   feather growth have been observed in competitively disadvantaged
   nestlings in several other passerine species in which broods hatch
   asynchronously. Maintaining normal feather growth may be an evolved
   strategy which allows late-hatched nestlings to fledge and travel with
   older nestmates and hence survive to independence. Alternatively, normal
   rates of feather growth may simply result from the nutrients required
   for feathers (i.e., proteins) being more available in the prey of small
   passerines than the nutrients required for other body components (e.g.,
   calcium for bones).}},

Abstract = {{Photographs that clearly disclose avian-nest predators are difficult to
   obtain, particularly when predators are small and exhibit subtle
   depredatory behavior. We exposed House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) eggs
   injected with Rhodamine B dye in camera-monitored ground nests for 12-d
   periods at 76 sites within mixed-hardwood forest stands in central
   Massachusetts, June-July 1997. Dye-injected eggs enabled us to recognize
   with certainty when eggs were breached at the nest because their
   contents were fluorescent pink and readily detected photographically.
   Eleven potential predator species were identified disturbing nests, of
   which eight were confirmed as predators. Eastern chipmunks (Tamias
   striatus) were the most frequent predators detected, along with fisher
   (Martes pennanti), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta
   cristata), Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), an Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus),
   and a white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). White-footed mice were
   the most commonly detected species disturbing nests, but were
   photographed only once actually destroying an egg. The visual cue
   provided by dye-injected House Sparrow eggs confirmed depredatory
   behavior by eastern chipmunks, Black-capped Chickadees, an Eastern
   Towhee, and a white-footed mouse.}},

Abstract = {{Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) marked with small radio-transmitters
   in 1995 and 1996 at a breeding site in south-central British Columbia,
   Canada, were subsequently detected in fall at Mono Lake (California) and
   Great Salt Lake (Utah). At least 50\% of all marked birds were detected
   on Mono Lake, and data collected in mid-October suggested that this
   proportion was consistent across years. These observations largely
   confirm a fall migration pattern that had been previously based on
   leg-band returns. Radio-tracking also confirmed that some movement
   occurred between Mono Lake and Salton Sea. In terms of the number of
   marked birds detected, the internal antenna-type transmitter produced
   superior results over other (attachment) protocols but their short range
   (<2 km) means that they will be effective only at sites where the birds
   are both abundant and concentrated such as Mono Lake, Great Salt Lake.

Abstract = {{We used aerial surveys and reports from experienced birders and
   biologists to identify potentially important sites for wintering
   shorebirds in coastal Florida. We visited 273 sites in November and
   December 1993 to assess use by shorebirds and, based on abundance and
   number of species, we selected the 60 most important sites. We visited
   these 60 sites at least 3 times between 16 Dec. 1993 and 1 Mar. 1994 and
   recorded 25 species among an estimated 30,501 shorebirds wintering at
   the sites. Dunlin (Calidris alpina), Western Sandpipers (C. mauri),
   Sanderlings (C. alba), and dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.) were the most
   commonly observed species. Coastal Florida was winter host to >3\% of
   the estimated North American population of Wilson's Plovers (Charadrius
   wilsonia), Piping Plovers (C. melodus), and American Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus palliatus). Fifty-three of the 60 most important sites were
   on Florida's west coast. St. George Sound, Tampa Bay, and Florida Bay
   contained sites with the highest numbers and most species of shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{Population viability analyses for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus)
   are highly sensitive to survival estimates, especially those of adults.
   Thus, the discrepancy between the previous adult survival estimate for
   the Great Plains Piping Plover population (0.664, SE = 0.057) and
   estimates from other regions and closely related species prompted us to
   re-ex amine banding data for Great Plains plovers. We used published
   data plus three additional years of band resightings, data from banded
   juveniles, and a new modeling approach to estimate local annual survival
   rates of adults and immatures for a breeding site in central North
   Dakota in 1984-1994. Mean adult survival was 0.737 (SE = 0.092), and the
   temporal variance was 0.040-0.045. Immature survival was 0.318 (SE =
   0.075), but true immature survival is probably higher, mostly due to
   unknown but likely high dispersal rates. Based on our revised survival
   estimate for adult Piping Plovers and projections from published plover
   population models, it is likely that the feasibility of recovering the
   Great Plains population is greater than previously thought.}},

   the breeding season (late February to late March) when snow covered the

   43\% of targeted birds when female magpies were fertile and incubating.

Abstract = {{We examined vegetation characteristics around nest sites of the Hermit
   Thrush (Catharus guttatus) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) for three
   summers in the northern- and mixed-hardwood forests of northern
   Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to test the hypothesis
   that nests with greater concealment are less vulnerable to depredation.
   Because these two ground-nesting passerines differ in terms of nest
   structure and behavior near the nest, they present an opportunity to
   examine how these two factors influence reproductive success in
   sympatric species. Depredation was the most common source of nest
   failure for both species, with Ovenbirds having higher nest success for
   data pooled across years. Side (but not overhead) concealment was
   correlated positively with nest success for the Hermit Thrush but not
   for the Ovenbird. Side and overhead concealment did not differ between
   the Hermit Thrush and Ovenbird. We found a substantial proportion of
   nests in ground pine (Lycopodium obscurum). Hermit Thrush, but not
   Ovenbird nests in ground pine were significantly more concealed than
   nests in other sites both from the side and overhead. Vegetative
   concealment at the nest microsite may be more important to the open-cup
   nest of the Hermit Thrush than to the domed nest of the Ovenbird.
   Because flushed Ovenbirds perform a distraction display and Hermit
   Thrushes do not, Ovenbirds may have an incentive to choose nest sites
   that offer less than maximum concealment.}},

Abstract = {{Obligate brood parasitic birds may improve their reproductive success if
   they cause the failure of nests that they had not parasitized, because
   many host species renest soon after failed nesting attempts and
   replacement nests may be available for future parasitism. Presently
   there is conflicting evidence on a key correlate of this
   parasite-predator hypothesis, namely whether parasitized nests survive
   at higher rates than non-parasitized nests. Using data collected by
   volunteers for the Cornell Nest Record Program and by examining nest
   survival in a northeastern population of Song Sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia) where parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) was
   common, I found that parasitized sparrow nests in the nestcard sample
   were more likely to survive at the early stages of the nesting cycle
   than non-parasitized nests. In addition, while overall reproductive
   success in the focal study population did not differ significantly
   between parasitized and non-parasitized hosts, non-parasitized nests
   were significantly more likely to fail due to predation prior to
   hatching than non-parasitized nests. Whether the correlation between the
   presence of parasitic eggs and decreased predation occurs due to
   cowbirds causing the failure of non-parasitized nests or, alternatively,
   preference for safe host nests and/or the protection of parasitized
   nests by parasitic females, will require direct observations and
   experimental manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{We trapped Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus) during fall
   migration, using House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), European Starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris), and Ringed Turtle Doves (Streptopelia risoria) as
   lures. Adults and males initiated attacks on sparrows more frequently
   than juveniles and females. Adult females initiated attacks on starlings
   and doves more often than adult males, but there was no such difference
   between the sexes in juveniles. Females actually struck all three
   species of lure more frequently than males, and juvenile females struck
   lures more frequently than adult females. There was no age difference in
   the incidence of strikes by males. Larger (longer-winged) juvenile males
   and females attacked starlings more often than smaller juveniles, but
   there were no size differences in strikes on prey in any age and sex
   group of hawks, suggesting that sexual dimorphism in size is not a
   result of selection for differences in prey size. Females struck
   disproportionately larger lures than males, presumably because they are
   less efficient at capturing smaller prey. Juveniles attacked doves as
   frequently as starlings, and there was little age difference in the
   incidence of strikes, suggesting that inexperience in judging the size
   of prey is an inadequate explanation for the many attacks that fail to
   result in strikes.}},

   occurring in two stages. Males arrive on territories before females and
   begin the first stage by building a stick foundation in a suitable
   cavity. In the second stage, females build a soft cup-like structure
   into the stick base. However, descriptive data from over 300 h of
   observation of House Wren nest construction in New York demonstrate that
   female House Wrens actually carry significantly more sticks to nest
   cavities than do males. Because females perform a behavior previously

Abstract = {{Survey stations to measure Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
   activity in low-elevation forest are often preferentially placed on
   stream channels because they provide wide visibility and the greatest
   chances of visually detecting birds and thus behaviors possibly
   associated with nesting. Detections of birds flying along stream
   channels to access nesting habitat farther inland will inflate estimates
   of activity associated with the adjacent forest. We compared numbers and
   types of murrelet detections between 12 paired stations within 100 m of
   each other on streambeds and in similar habitat in adjacent forest
   during 8 Jun-10 Jul. 1997 in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia. Circling
   and below-canopy flight, thought to be indicative of nesting, were
   observed at all streambed survey stations and at less than half of
   paired forest stations. Numbers of such ``occupied{''} detections were
   six times greater at streambed than forest sites. Size of opening at
   survey stations accounted for much of the difference in detection rates
   between forest and streambed stations, but numbers of total, visual, and
   occupied detections, specifically those of circling birds, were lower at
   forest than streambed stations even after the effect of opening size had
   been considered. Correlations between opening size and numbers of
   detections at streambed but not at forest locations, also indicated that
   differences between streambed and forest stations were not solely a
   function of opening size. Observations at one pair of stations where
   murrelets were using a flight corridor over the forest station indicated
   chat a corridor effect may not be confined to streambed locations.
   Results indicated that placement of survey stations on stream channels
   is appropriate if the goal is to determine murrelet presence or the
   occurrence of occupied detections in an area. However, if a comparison
   of murrelet activity between habitat types is the objective, then forest
   stations with comparable opening sizes may be needed to provide unbiased
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of wetlands to agriculture and development negatively impacts
   waterfowl. Greentree reservoirs are forested tracts that are
   purposefully flooded to increase hunting opportunities for sportsman and
   to provide shelter for waterfowl such as Mallards (Anas platyrhynchus).
   These human-made wetlands can also make natural foods such as acorns and
   invertebrates available to Mallards. Food habits analysis conducted in
   1959 indicated acorns composed 24\% of the volume of diets of Mallards
   collected from a variety of habitats including agricultural fields,
   naturally flooded bottomland forests, and greentree reservoirs in
   Arkansas. However, changes that may have occurred in food use by
   Mallards in bottomland hardwood habitats in Arkansas since last examined
   are unclear. We examined foods used by Mallards in greentree reservoirs
   from November 1990 to February 1991 in southeastern Arkansas. Seventeen
   species of plants and 21 families/orders of animals occurred in the diet
   of Mallards. Mallards consumed 65\% plant matter, primarily seeds of
   narrowleaf foresteria (Foresteria angustifolia), Nuttall oak (Quercus
   nuttallii), Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum), and rice
   (Oryza sativa). Invertebrate taxa, constituting 6\% or more of the
   sample by both volume and mass, included the orders Coleoptera, Diptera,
   and Isopoda. Diets of Mallards present in greentree reservoirs in our
   study indicate Mallards still use natural foods, though agricultural
   seeds were in close proximity to natural foods.}},

Abstract = {{We describe sexual dichromatism in the plumage of juvenile Brown-headed
   Cowbirds (Molothrus ater obscurus) collected in Ventura County,
   California in 1991. The dichromatism was based on two colorimetric
   features. The first was the contrast between the greater underwing
   coverts and the remiges, with males having darker coverts, and therefore
   greater contrast between their underwing coverts and remiges. The second
   was the color and extent of pale feather edges on the underside of the
   distal portion of the carpometacarpal joint, with males having wider,
   slightly darker feather edging. Five observers were used to test the
   reliability of these characters in a sample of museum wings from
   cowbirds of known sex. They were 88-94\% accurate at determining the sex
   of 33 juvenile cowbirds (17 males, 16 females) using these two
   colorimetric characters. This technique was slightly more reliable than
   wing chord (84.8\% accurate) and tarsometatarsus (also 84.8\% accurate)
   measurements in differentiating the sex of our sample individuals.}},

Abstract = {{For six years we examined the reproductive biology of Common Moorhens
   (Gallinula chloropus) nesting in an impounded cattail (Typha spp.) marsh
   in South Carolina, USA. The egg-laying period averaged 78 days. Most
   (52\%) of 82 nests were started in May. The moorhens appeared to be
   single-brooded. Mean clutch size was 6.55, the same as that reported
   from field studies in Britain, but significantly smaller than that
   calculated from South Carolina oology data. Common Moorhens occasionally
   built their nests on those of Boat-tailed Grackles (Quiscalus major),
   and in one instance a moorhen laid an egg in a grackle nest. About 18\%
   of moorhen nests were parasitized by other moorhens, which usually added
   one or two eggs. Over four years, we estimated that 68\% of 54 moorhen
   nests produced at least one fledgling, an estimate close to that
   reported by researchers in Britain. Most nest mortality probably was
   caused by snakes, because large mammals and avian predators rarely were
   noted in the study area. The relatively high reproductive success of
   Common Moorhens appears to be related to the species' use of extensive
   stands of cattails growing in a sheltered area with controlled water
   levels. The moorhens also may benefit from the presence of American
   alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), which discourage large mammals,
   and from Boat-tailed Grackles, which mob avian predators.}},

Abstract = {{Data collected in a 40-ha reedbed of southers France were used to
   compare the efficiency and limitation of mist-net and point-count
   techniques in estimating the composition and structure of a bird
   assemblage dominated by the Bearded Tit (Panurus biarmicus), the
   Moustached Warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon), and the Reed Warbler
   (Acrocephalus scirpaceus). Null model analyses were used to determine
   the effect of spatial variability on estimates of species richness and
   relative abundance with the two sampling techniques. A 50-m net line
   operated during 5 h or two 50-m radius point counts of 10 min conducted
   6 wk apart provided a similar estimation of species composition and
   relative abundance. While a sampling effort of 10 net lines or 13 point
   counts would permit the detection of a 25\% difference in the relative
   abundance of most species (whether over time or among sites), the
   analyses on community structure suggest that 26 net lines or 13 point
   counts are necessary to sample adequately the structure of the bird
   assemblage (proportion of individuals from each species) in the 40-ha
   reedbed. This minimum sampling effort, however, is strongly influenced
   by the variance in number of individuals sampled, which differed among
   bird species. For instance, removal of highly mobile species such as the
   Bearded Tit, reduced by half the minimum sampling effort. To provide a
   reliable estimate of species richness and relative abundance, point
   counts must be based on both visual and auditory cues (30\% of the birds
   sampled were silent), and be carried out at different periods to cover
   the early breeding season of any abundant species. While point counts
   are less demanding in the field, manipulation of netted birds permits
   the documentation of various aspects of their biology, which compensated
   for the increased time and effort needed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the Hermit Thrush's wide distribution and exceptional singing
   ability, its vocal behavior is poorly known. In recorded samples from
   Arizona and New England, we show that males have repertoires of 6 to 12
   discrete song types. Those types can be presented in highly regular
   sequences, but the order varies among males, perhaps depending on
   context or motivation. Arizona and New England songs differed in several
   frequency and temporal features, such as the duration and frequency of
   the introductory whistle and the remainder of the song, suggesting
   regional differences in Hermit Thrush songs. How these geographic
   differences in song are influenced by song development and dispersal
   should be a focus of future research.}},

Abstract = {{Community-level indices of reproductive success are useful for measuring
   or monitoring demographic effects of habitat alteration on birds. We
   present a time-efficient method to estimate the relative reproductive
   activity of the forest songbird community. A recording of mobbing calls
   of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) was broadcast at
   preselected stations during the breeding season. These calls attracted
   individuals of many bird species present in the vicinity, allowing
   visual detection of reproductive activity (e.g., adults carrying food or
   presumed pairs). In mature deciduous forests of northern New Brunswick,
   50 bird species responded to the playbacks. playbacks significantly
   increased the probability of visual observations of birds compared to
   silent observations conducted before broadcasting mobbing calls. In
   coniferous forests of central Quebec, playbacks attracted 24 species and
   also provided a significantly greater opportunity to make visual
   observations of individual birds. In New Brunswick, mobbing playbacks
   facilitated more observations of reproductive evidence relative to point
   counts. Observation periods were brief and a 306-ha plot (1.75 x 1.75
   km, 64 points spaced 250 m apart) could he surveyed by foot in less than
   32 observer-hours. The proportion of individuals of a given species
   showing evidence of reproductive activity was used as an index of
   reproductive success. Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica
   caerulescens) and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) had a reproductive
   index consistent with their true nesting success as derived from
   intensive nest monitoring on the same plots.}},

Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{484-492}},

Abstract = {{Researchers often use nasal saddles or discs to identify individuals in
   studies of waterfowl ecology, but previous studies showed that these
   markers may have detrimental effects on reproductive behavior and
   success of Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis). To our knowledge, a
   non-intrusive, external marker that is easy to observe does not exist
   for breeding Ruddy Ducks. We evaluated effects of a modified nasal
   marker on behavior of female Ruddy Ducks during pre-laying, laying, and
   brood rearing. There was no evidence that nasal markers had an adverse
   influence on nesting patterns of pre-laying and laying females. During
   brood rearing, however, nasal-marked individuals spent more time
   scratching their bills and less time alert than unmarked controls.
   Although bill scratching was more frequent, nasal markers did not appear
   to influence overall reproductive behavior during nesting and or brood
   rearing, bur. we do not know whether reduced vigilance behavior affected
   survival of young during brood rearing. This nasal marker is a
   relatively non-intrusive and visible alternative for studying the
   short-term reproductive ecology of female Ruddy Ducks and possibly other
   Oxyurinae or anatids not commonly studied because of unique nasal
   morphologies (i.e., partially divided nasal septa and small nasal
   openings) which make them difficult to mark. Additionally, this marker
   may have application for species wintering in colder regions where nasal
   markers are at risk of icing. Nevertheless, we strongly suggest that
   researchers evaluate possible effects of these markers as part and
   parcel of future studies.}},

   Sexes did not differ in survival. The probability of reproducing
   successfully, based on the number of pairs accompanied by independent
   young the following dry season, was only 8\% and no territory produced
   more than one successful nest, if any. In one year (1997) reproduction
   was significantly better (25\%) than the other years, perhaps associated
   with lowered predation during an extremely dry wet season. We suggest

   (Troglodytes aedon) to identify wintering sites of individuals coming

   States, especially Florida. In contrast, birds breeding west of the
   Appalachian Mountains (n = 23) into the eastern Great Plains may winter
   anywhere from South Carolina and Florida west into Texas. It also
   appears that individuals from the same breeding populations winter in
   different sites. The few recoveries (n = 4) of birds from breeding sites
   on the western Great Plains indicate that at least some individuals from
   this region travel not due south but rather southeast during migration
   and winter in the eastern half of the southern U.S. No long-distance

   1.7-7.6 males/km(2) in the unmanaged forest. The proportion of males
   that used alternate drumming sites within activity centers ranged from
   2\% to 44\% and was positively correlated with drumming male density.
   The number of alternate sites used within activity centers also
   increased with density; males used up to five alternate sites during a
   high-density year. Distances between alternate drumming sites and
   primary sites were not correlated with density but were greater on the
   unmanaged forest. The spatial orientation of multiple alternate sites
   relative to the primary site within each activity center suggested the
   use of alternate sites was a directional response. The actual direction
   of the response was not consistent among activity centers in the study
   area indicating it was not a result of prevailing abiotic factors such
   as wind, climate, or geomorphology. Similarly the placement of alternate
   drumming sites was not directed toward nearest neighboring males. We
   discuss potential causes of the behavior, its adaptive significance, and
   implications to commonly used survey techniques for Puffed Grouse
   populations.}},

   Overall, 36.4\% of Yellow Warbler nests (n = 66) were parasitized by
   Brown-headed Cowbirds. Although parasitized and nonparasitized nests
   were equally likely to fledge at least one warbler, in nonparasitized
   nests, warblers had larger clutches, hatched more young, and tended to
   fledge more young. Frequency of parasitism was not influenced by nest
   height and, on a weekly basis, was not correlated with number of warbler
   nests initiated. Overall, 39.1\% of Yellow Warbler nests were lost to
   predators, but complete predation was not affected by nest height. On a
   weekly basis, percent complete predation of warbler nests increased with
   number of active nests. No significant relationship existed between
   frequency of complete predation and frequency of parasitism in Yellow

   characteristics of 32 Red-breasted Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) nests
   in the high-elevation coastal forests of northern Vancouver Island,
   British Columbia. Nests were located in western white pine (Pinus
   monticola), hemlock (Tsuga sp.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
   snags. Nest trees were significantly taller and had a greater DBH chan
   random snags. Nest height was positively correlated with tree height.
   All nests were in dead trees. The orientation of nest cavity entrances
   did not differ from random orientations. When choosing nest sites,
   Red-breasted Sapsuckers are likely balancing predation risk (decreasing
   at higher nest heights) and adequate nest space and insulation (greater
   with increasing diameter at lower nest heights).}},

Abstract = {{Not accounting for collar loss when using observations of collared geese
   to estimate survival can result in an underestimation of the survival
   rates and a loss of precision. As part of a study of goose populations
   in the Western Canadian Arctic, we determined collar retention rates for
   ``small{''} Canada Geese (mainly Branta canadensis parvipes) and Greater
   White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons) that had been collared in one year
   and recaptured in a subsequent year. We recaptured 5.3\% (133/2504) of
   the Canada Geese and 7.3\% (373/5098) of the Greater White-fronted Geese
   that we collared. Annual retention rates for thin (0.08 cm),
   double-wrapped collars placed on Canada Geese were low for males (0.650
   +/- 0.052 SE) but significantly higher for females (0.826 +/- 0.044).
   Retention rates of thick (0.16 cm), single-wrapped collars placed on
   Greater White-fronted Geese were high for males (0.982 +/- 0.007) and
   even higher for females (1.000 +/- 0). Retention rates did not vary with
   collar age, but our study probably did nor continue long enough, or have
   large enough samples, to adequately assess this. Retention rates for
   Canada Goose collars depended on manufacturer, with rates as low as
   0.282 +/- 0.111 for males and 0.566 +/- 0.114 for females for collars
   produced by one supplier. Our data suggest that collar loss was a
   significant problem for Canada Geese, but not for Greater White-fronted
   Geese. We recommend that other researchers using observations of
   collared individuals to calculate survival should also assess if
   estimates need to be adjusted because of collar loss.}},

Abstract = {{Birds with both eastern and western distributions occur in the Black
   Hills of western South Dakota. This forest is mostly ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) and is managed for timber. Logging alters forest
   characteristics and the bird community. We studied habitat relations of
   breeding songbirds at the stand- and site-level scares in ponderosa pine
   and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides)/paper birch (Betula papyrifera)
   forest. Sixty bird species were observed less than or equal to 50 m from
   count points. Species richness was greater in aspen/birch than in
   ponderosa pine. Species richness was generally lower in ponderosa pine
   with >40\% overstory canopy cover (OCC) than in ponderosa pine with less
   than or equal to 40\% OCC and than aspen/birch of any structural stage.
   Seven bird species were associated with the ponderosa pine, while four
   species were associated with aspen/birch. Bird associations at the
   stand-level were further refined by OCC and diameter-at-breast-height
   (DBH) structural stage of each forest type. Habitats for most birds in
   the Black Hills can be managed using current forest inventory
   descriptions that include OCC and DBH. However, Red-naped Sapsuckers
   (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis),
   White-breasted Nuthatches (S. carolinensis), Ovenbirds (Seiurus
   aurocapillus, and Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana) were strongly
   associated with site-level vegetation characteristics. Snag density,
   snag condition, and deciduous trees beneath the ponderosa pine canopy
   should be included in forest inventories to better quantify habitats for
   these birds.}},

Abstract = {{The timing, pattern, and extent of the first prebasic wing molt of
   White-winged Crossbills (Loxia leucoptera) were determined during a 6-yr
   banding study in interior Alaska. Hatching-year birds were not caught in
   substantial numbers until May, and all crossbills molted from juvenal to
   first basic plumage between September and December. A subsample
   consisting of 65 males and 55 females in first basic plumage was used to
   determine the pattern and extent of wing covert molt. On average, birds
   molted three greater coverts (GC) and retained two juvenal medial
   coverts (MC) per wing. The number of molted GCs was negatively
   correlated with that of juvenal MCs. Twenty-three percent of the
   individuals molted no GC, and no crossbill replaced all these feathers.
   The pattern and extent of covert molt was similar in males and females
   and was symmetrical in 69\% of the individuals, but differed by one or
   two feathers in the remaining birds. Males in first basic plumage and
   with partially red or pink contour feathers molted more GCs and retained
   fewer MCs than males without contour feathers of these colors, although
   both groups apparently were of the same age. Remex molt was found in
   only one bird, which also showed partial proximal secondaries (=tertial)
   replacement.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether regular researcher Visits affected egg hatchability
   or nest predation for three ground-nesting bird species that incur high
   levels of nest predation, primarily by small mammals. Frequently Visited
   finch-lark (Eremopserix verticalis and E. australis) nests suffered
   similar predation to nests visited infrequently, suggesting that regular
   visits had no additive effects on nest survival. A comparison of
   finch-lark nests visited for the second time either one or two days
   after the first visit found that predation during the first 24 h (7.4\%)
   was lower than predation during the second 24-h period (9.9\%),
   suggesting that the act of visiting a nest did not increase the risk of
   predation. Daily predation rates on Namaqua Sandgrouse (Pterocles
   namaqua) and finch-lark nests showed no observable trend with an
   increasing number of visits over time, indicating that frequent visits
   had no cumulative effect on predation probabilities. Nests of both
   Grey-backed Finch-lark (E. verticalis) and Black-eared Finch-lark (E.
   australis) discovered at the egg stage did not fledge significantly
   fewer young than nests discovered at the nestling stage, suggesting that
   investigator disturbance had no effect on egg hatchability. These
   results from the southern hemisphere subtropics support the findings of
   limited north-temperate studies that largely mammalian nest predation
   does not increase after researcher disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated nest-site selection of sympatrically breeding skuas
   (Catharacta spp.) and Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) in the Antarctic
   Peninsula. We evaluated habitat preferences of nesting skuas and gulls
   in a patchy landscape by counting the numbers of nests in each of ten
   habitat types. Additionally we evaluated the importance of 11 habitat
   variables (known to be influential to the reproductive success of marine
   birds) on nest-site selection by skuas and gulls. Both skuas and Kelp
   Gulls did not used habitat types in proportion to their availability.
   Skuas tended to nest in highlands with a north-northwest aspect, and in
   depressed areas with stable substrata. Kelp Gulls nested exclusively on
   coastal cliffs and pebble beaches, with no difference in tendency to use
   either habitat. Skua and gull nest sites were differentiated by
   elevation, percent of vegetation cover, slope, and microtopography.
   Grasses (for Kelp Gull), mosses (for skuas), and rockiness were the main
   variables predicting differential use of the available environment.
   Factors such as type of nest materials, proximity to foraging areas,
   social interactions, and presence of other species, among others,
   probably also affect nest-site selection for both skuas and gulls at
   Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula.}},

Abstract = {{The scientific value of avian research specimens is immense, but the
   accumulation rate of this resource is too low to meet either present or
   future needs. This may be due, in part, to the fact that few students
   are currently being taught to prepare specimens. Modern specimen
   preparation is a routine but detailed and meticulous process in which
   comparatively few are expert. I summarize methods far obtaining bird
   specimens and preserving them both for the short term and for the long
   term as high duality scientific research specimens. The preparation
   method outlined preserves skin, partial skeleton, stomach contents and
   two duplicate tissue samples for every specimen, maximizing the
   scientific usefulness of each bird. The resulting skins and skeletons
   augment current samples, simultaneously increasing the sample sizes
   available for studies involving either type of specimen. These methods
   allow a diverse array of data to be taken from every individual, and are
   thus suitable for general preparation or focused, single-species
   research projects. These archival quality methods assure that, if
   prepared as outlined, the skin and skeleton specimens possess a useful
   life of half a millennium or more. I suggest that this is an
   unparalleled opportunity to make a personal, signed, long-term
   contribution to science with relatively little time investment.}},

Abstract = {{From 1992 to 1997, I monitored population size and productivity of
   Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) nesting along 80 km of coast on the eastern
   side of the Gulf of California, Mexico. During the study period, the
   number of nesting pairs increased by an estimated 5-14\%. The percentage
   of successful pairs varied significantly among years, ranging from 50\%.
   In three of the six years, the productivity of breeding pairs exceeded
   the estimated level necessary to maintain Osprey population size in at
   least parts of the species' range. However, three of the last four years
   were characterized by low reproductive success and by a higher
   proportion of late clutches. In 1997, the most unproductive of the six
   years, 38 of 40 (95\%) nesting pairs failed to produce any fledgling.
   That same year; however, the observed productivity of 10 pairs on two
   nearby islands was 15 times higher than on the mainland. In 1994, 1995,
   and 1996, successful pairs were significantly clumped, indicating that
   in the study area, nesting success was strongly influenced by local
   factors. The results of this study warrant further research to identify
   the source(s) of annual and spatial differences in nesting success.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Ontario is the only Great Lake where a significant number of
   Red-throated Loons are seen during fall migration. Observations from
   Hamlin Bench State Park, New York during fall months, 1993-1997, were
   used to analyze their movements. Annually an average of 7750
   Red-throated Loons were counted moving mostly west on the south shore of
   Lake Ontario. Their median date of occurrence was 22 November with the
   peak period of migration from 17 November to 1 December. The earliest
   migrants appeared in mid-October and became extremely rare after
   December. The seasonal timing on Lake Ontario corresponds to that
   observed on the Atlantic Ocean at Avalon, New Jersey. Their occurrence
   on Lake Ontario was analyzed with respect to local and mid-arctic
   weather conditions. The variable which best correlates with their
   appearance is mid-arctic temperature. On average, large flights (>200
   loons pet day) began on Lake Ontario 3 d after the invasion of a cold
   air mass is centered approximately 1100 km to the north, After this
   event, the period of sustained flight was maintained for 7-16 d when
   80\% of migration takes place. The fall arrival pattern of Red-throated
   Loons on Lake Ontario implies that migration lakes place under any type
   of weather conditions, but local temperature, wind direction, and the
   movement of cold fronts are all weakly correlated to their migration.
   Inland fall sight records of Red-throated Loons from American Birds
   suggest that the main inland migration route is through western
   Pennsylvania. This is consistent with observations of Red-throated Loons
   leaving the western end of Lake Ontario. A smaller part of the inland
   migration is east of Lake Ontario based on these records.}},

Abstract = {{Surveying birds during the non-breeding season in prairie environments
   can be difficult because birds are less visible and vocal during this
   period than they are during the breeding season. We compared the
   effectiveness of using fixed-radius point counts and rope-dragging
   transects for surveying non-breeding birds and determining their
   relative abundances in the Florida Everglades, from November 1997
   through January 1998. Effort (person work hours) was compared using
   species-effort and abundance-effort curves. Relative abundances of total
   birds, American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Sedge Wren (
   Cistothorus platensis), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and
   Seaside Sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) were greater using
   transects. Abundances of other common species were similar using both
   techniques. More species were detected on transects than on point
   counts. When considering effort involved, transects detected more total
   species, but point counts detected a greater total number of birds.
   Overall, transects took more effort to cover similar amounts of habitat.
   Differences in detection using these two techniques may be attributed to
   species-specific behaviors. Research focused on non-breeding season bird
   communities should consider using rope-dragging transects in appropriate
   habitat because point counts may underestimate abundances of some
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate population models for the endangered Interior Least Tern
   (Sterna antillarum) cannot be generated without;age-specific survival
   estimates. Our purpose was to estimate chick survival from hatching to
   fledging, for Least Terns nesting at two sites on the Lower Mississippi
   River in Missouri, using mark-recapture methodology. We banded 110 Least
   Tern chicks during 1995 on sand island nesting colonies situated at
   river kilometers (Rkm) 1431 and 1481 on the Lower Mississippi River. We
   used Program JOLLY to compute survival point estimates, their associated
   variances, and goodness-of-fit tests for Jolly-Seber open population
   models (Pollock et al. 1990). The mean daily survival rate for Least
   Tern chicks at Rkm 1431 was 0.951 (SE = 0.03) with 95\% confidence
   intervals of 0.899-1.003. Mean daily survival rate for Least Tern chicks
   at Rkm 1481 was 0.972 (SE = 0.03) with 95\% confidence intervals of
   0.911-1.034. Estimated survival of Least Tern chicks throughout the
   entire 17-d fledging interval was 0.43 at Rkm 1431 and 0.62 at Rkm 1481.
   Based oil survival rate estimates and number of known pairs producing
   chicks we estimated 0.72 and 1.0 fledglings/pair were produced at Rkm
   1431 and Rkm 1481, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the efficacy of 400-m line transects and sets of three point
   counts at detecting avian richness and abundance in bottomland hardwood
   forests and intensively managed cottonwood (Populus deltoides)
   plantations within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We detected more
   species and more individuals on line transects than on three point
   counts during 218 paired surveys conducted between 24 March and 3 June,
   1996 and 1997. Line transects also yielded more birds per unit of time,
   even though point counts yielded higher estimates of relative bird
   density. In structurally more-complex bottomland hardwood forests, we
   detected more species and individuals on line transects, but in
   more-open cottonwood plantations, transects surpassed point counts only
   at detecting species within 50 m of the observer. Species richness and
   total abundance of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants and temperate migrants
   were greater on line transects within bottomland hardwood forests.
   Within cottonwood plantations, however, only species richness of
   Nearctic-Neotropical migrants and total abundance of temperate migrants
   were greater on line transects. Because we compared survey techniques
   using the same observer, within the same forest stand on a given day, we
   assumed that the technique yielding greater estimates of avian species
   richness and total abundance per unit of effort is superior. Thus, for
   monitoring migration within hardwood forests of the Mississippi Alluvial
   Valley, we recommend using line transects instead of point counts.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all previous studies of saltmarsh-nesting Common Terns on the
   east coast of the United States have concluded that tidal saltmarshes
   were suboptimal or marginal breeding habitats. Questioning that
   conclusion, we analyzed patterns of both saltmarsh and nonmarsh colony
   use (stability, movement, establishment, abandonment, and size) obtained
   during 5 yr of annual helicopter censuses of all Common and Roseate
   terns breeding on Long Island, New York. We found 1900-3600 pairs at
   10-33 saltmarsh and 22-30 nonmarsh sites; there were few biologically
   important differences between Common Terns nesting at marsh and at
   nonmarsh sites. We did find that (1) marsh sites and colony sizes
   increased through the study period; (2) both marsh and nonmarsh colonies
   grew with duration of occupancy; (3) smaller marsh and nonmarsh colonies
   (<50 pairs) usually lasted only 1-2 yr, while larger colonies were
   equally likely to persist far 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 yr; (4) numbers of marsh
   and nonmarsh sites used each year were generally unrelated to population
   sizes; (5) 5-yr sites composed only 10.6\% of total marsh and 17.6\% of
   total nonmarsh sites; (6) the mean sizes of both newly established and
   about-to-be-abandoned colonies were smaller than the mean sizes of all
   others when averaged between but not within years; (7) most previously
   occupied sites, once abandoned, remained so for only 1 yr, and most new
   sites were occupied for only a single year; (8) annual turnover rates
   were 32\%-49\% for both marsh and nonmarsh sites; (9) marsh and nonmarsh
   breeding populations were correlated each year, allowing estimation of
   the total Long Island population to within +/- 4\% by censusing only the
   20-25\% in saltmarshes. Roseate Tern data were few, especially in
   marshes, obviating marsh-nonmarsh comparisons, except that Roseates
   failed to persist in saltmarshes, and their overall mean colony sizes
   across the same numbers of years' occupancy were usually smaller than
   Commons', although their turnover rates were roughly the same. We
   conclude that saltmarsh-nesting Common Terns are well adapted to marsh
   nesting and that they have probably been doing so for perhaps hundreds
   of generations. We hypothesize that it may have been a relict population
   of saltmarsh-nesters that saved the species from extirpation in the late
   1800s. In contrast, Roseate Tern's failure to exploit extensive
   saltmarsh habitat seems yet another factor abetting its precarious
   status in northeastern North America.}},

Abstract = {{Quail eggs and artificial nests have become a common way of assessing
   predation risk for nesting passerine birds. However, the technique is
   biased against small predators that are unable to destroy large,
   thick-shelled quail eggs but that are capable of breaking small
   passerine eggs. To avoid this bias, many researchers use eggs made of
   modeling clay that can be readily marked by small predators.
   Unfortunately, modeling clay has an odor that may influence predator
   behavior. To determine if clay eggs suffered higher rates of predation
   than quail eggs and whether clay had an odor that influenced predators,
   we placed 135 artificial ground nests containing either clay, quail, or
   quail eggs scented dth a clay odor. Nests filled with quail eggs had
   higher cumulative survival (63\%: n = 45) than those with clay eggs
   (27\%: n = 45). However, clay odor did not attract predators, as nests

   techniques for the study of Amazona parrots in northeastern Mexico. We
   describe two of these techniques considered novel and employed for nest
   inspections and sampling crop contents of nestlings. Inspections
   included modification of nests and use of a video probe. Crop sampling
   of chicks was done using a plastic cylinder from 20 days of age until
   fledging. The techniques did not cause nest abandonment or increase in
   chick mortality. We obtained information that has substantially advanced
   understanding of the biology and conservation needs of these species. We
   hope these techniques will aid future studies and facilitate comparisons
   among diverse species.}},

Abstract = {{I studied the reproductive success of the Wood Stork (Mycteria
   americana) in a seasonally inundated savanna in the southern Ilanos of
   Venezuela. Two breeding colonies were occupied by Wood Storks during the
   1989-1990 nesting season. Storks arrived at the colonies in October, and
   most of the clutches were laid during the second half of November. The
   nesting period extended to mid-March. Of the 840 Wood Stork nests
   counted, 30.9\% produced at least one chick of fledging age. One of the
   colonies was abandoned during the incubation period, whereas the other
   produced 435 fledglings (0.66 per nest). Predation by Crested Caracaras
   (Polyborus plancus) and eggs falling from the nest during early stages
   were the main causes of nesting failure. The entry of humans into Wood
   Stork colonies during early stages of nesting (October-November)
   increased egg/chick predation by Crested Caracaras, while parents were
   off their nests. Limited visits when young were half grown (after late
   January) did not result in large disturbance effects. As Wood Stork
   colonies in the study area are managed for ecotourism and receive heavy
   human visitation, measures to minimize human disturbance of colonies are
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Fumigation chambers are commonly used to remove avian ectoparasites
   without harming host birds. Although several fumigants are commonly
   used, we know of no systematic comparison of available fumigants, and
   there is no agreement as to which is best. We compared the efficiency of
   four fumigants that have been supported in the literature: chloroform,
   di-ethyl ether (ether), ethyl acetate, and CO2. We conducted two types
   of experiments using chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera). First,
   fumigants were ranked according to the speed with which they immobilized
   lice. CO2 immobilized lice most quickly, and ether the slowest. Second,
   fumigants were ranked according to the percentage of immobilized lice
   that detached from a suspended feather. Chloroform detached the most
   lice, and CO2 the least, with ether and ethyl acetate intermediate.
   Third, of those lice detaching, the mean time to detachment was the
   quickest under CO2. Finally: chloroform, ether, and ethyl acetate all
   kill lice; however CO2 only anaesthetizes lice, and lice quickly revive
   when exposed to fresh air.}},

   are a useful tool for quantifying the effects of other, more invasive
   techniques such as attaching ECG units. Artificial eggs are also
   potentially useful in physiology and energetics studies because they are
   simple to use, are relatively inexpensive to construct and operate, and
   are comparatively non-invasive to the birds. Nevertheless, some
   limitations of the operation and application of artificial eggs are

Abstract = {{An adult female Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus alter) was filmed as she
   killed all six nestlings of a Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus).
   Although several previous accounts provided strong indirect evidence of
   cowbird attacks on host nestlings, this is the first unequivocal
   evidence of such behavior to be reported. This behavior may enhance
   cowbird reproductive success by facilitating host renesting, thus
   providing an additional opportunity for nest parasitism. If so, this
   behavior has parallels to the infanticide documented for a number of
   species of mammals and birds.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{58-70}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Residents and wintering Nearctic migrants were sampled by point counts
   in 40 small to medium-sized (0.07-8.65 ha) shade coffee plantations with
   an overstory of Inga vera in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic.
   The purpose of the study was to determine the relative importance of
   plantation area, isolation, and habitat structure to avian distribution
   and abundance. Variation in abundance was unrelated to plantation area
   for all migrant species (n = 7), whereas the local abundance of four of
   ten resident species increased significantly with area. Elevation was
   the only variable that significantly contributed to the total number of
   species per plantation (fewer species at higher elevation), and no
   habitat variables significantly contributed to variation in the total
   number of migrant species. In contrast, significantly higher numbers of
   resident species were found in larger and older plantations at lower
   elevations, characterized by numerous stems greater than or equal to 3
   cm DBH, little or no pruning of overstory branches, and maximum canopy
   cover at 12.0-15.0 m. Coffee plantations with high levels of structural
   and floristic diversity should be encouraged for avian conservation, and
   even the smallest plantations, if not too isolated by treeless areas,
   can contribute to avian abundance and diversity in tropical agricultural
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the Peruvian Diving-Petrel (Pelecanoides garnotii) was
   studied from 211 stomach pumpings collected on San Gallan and La Vieja
   Islands, on the central coast of Peru. Planktonic invertebrates were the
   dominant food items representing 85.3\% and 91.1\% of the items ingested
   on San Gallan and La Vieja, respectively. The remainder of the stomach
   contents was fish. Euphausia mucronata was the principal prey, composing
   22.1\% by mass of the food ingested on San Gallan and 30\% on La Vieja.
   Fish larval stages represented 23.6\% and 19.4\% of the ingested food
   mass on these islands, respectively. Peruvian anchovy was present in
   only 3.2\% of the stomach contents on San Gallan and 7.8\% on La Vieja.
   Prey consumption varied seasonally probably due to changes in resource
   availability. Planktonic invertebrates were the main prey in summer,
   while there was a high proportion of fish larval stages during in
   winter.}},

   significantly affect (1) probability of a nest box being chosen for
   nesting, (2) date of nest initiation, (3) clutch sizes of early or late
   nests, or (4) mortality rates of nestlings. Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) parasitized few nests (4\%) and showed no preference
   for clean boxes vs those containing old nests. Nest-dwelling

   Rubbermaid(R) plastic file box was modified by adding a hinged
   plexiglass door with foam weatherstripping and a barrel bolt to one end,
   and a plastic dome and bullseye lever on top. The resulting 1.2-kg box,
   weighing 3 kg including a 1.8-kg balance or 4 kg with a I-kg ceramic
   floor tile added for stability in windy conditions, proved effective
   during three seasons of near-daily use in a tern colony.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of radio-marked ducklings are few, and none have examined the
   effect of radio transmitters on survival and body mass of Wood Duck (Aix
   sponsa) ducklings. We evaluated the effect of 1.6-g prong transmitters
   on survival and mass of captive reared, wild-strain Wood Duck ducklings
   during their first 2 wk of life. No differences in either survival (P >
   0.9) or body mass (0.20 less than or equal to: P less than or equal to
   0.34) were detected between radio-marked and unmarked ducklings. This
   transmitter and attachment method seem to be a viable technique for
   radio-marking free-ranging Wood Duck ducklings.}},

Abstract = {{During six summers from 1986 through 1995, we searched cultivated fields
   in Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
   and Texas for Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus) during the breeding
   and premigratory seasons. We observed 2208 Mountain Plovers on 416
   cultivated fields, 96.9\% of which were observed in seven counties in
   four states. We located 52 nests on cultivated fields: 50\% on fallow or
   bare fields (greater than or equal to 95\% bare), 23.1\% on wheat
   fields, 1.9\% on both wheat and forb stubble fields, and the remainder
   on fields of mile (13.5\%), forbs (7.7\%), and corn (3.8\%). Of 46 nests
   found on cultivated fields, 31 failed; 70.9\% were destroyed by farm
   machinery, and known losses to predation were only 3.3\%. Mountain
   Plovers nested and appeared to rear young (30 chicks observed) on
   cultivated fields in southern latitudes, particularly on fields used for
   winter wheat. Cultivated fields will play an important role in the
   conservation of the Mountain Plover, as it is considered for threatened
   or endangered status, but comparative research is needed to clarify that
   role relative re use of native habitat.}},

Abstract = {{During 1995-1996, we used tape playbacks of rail calls to study the
   effects of temporal and environmental factors on the probability of
   detecting California Black Rails (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus)
   at Suisun Bay, California. Detection probability was assessed in a
   relative sense from the number of rails detected per survey during
   surveys repeated over the same routes under differing temporal and
   environmental conditions. Detections were lower during winter compared
   to the breeding season, due to a decline in response (as opposed to a
   decline in number of rails). Temporal and environmental variables
   explained 15-20\% of the variation in detection probability during the
   breeding season. Number of detections varied considerably among days on
   the same route. On average, detection probability was relatively stable
   between late-April and early June, but increased from mid-June to early
   July, probably because of the appearance of young-of-the-year. Detection
   probability was greatest, and variation least, from sunrise to about 1.5
   h thereafter, and likewise for the 1.5-h period preceding sunset.
   Detections declined abruptly 0.75 h after sunset and were similarly low
   during the 1.5-h period before sunrise. Other variables having
   significant and independent effects on detection probability were tide
   height, moon phase, cloud cover, and air temperature; detections
   decreased with increase in tide height and cloud cover, and increased
   with increase in air temperature and moon light (during the preceding
   night). Time of day had the greatest effect on detection probability
   Studies of relative abundance of California Black Rails should be
   designed to standardize environmental factors and be repeated over the
   same route during the breeding season before the appearance of
   fledglings.}},

Abstract = {{We tested whether interested volunteers with low to moderate skill
   levels could be trained to identify and count a subset of forest birds,
   by song or call, well enough to provide credible data. Paired novice and
   experienced observers performed five simultaneous, unlimited distance
   10-min point counts of 12 (1995) or 13 (1996) target species. We found
   no differences in either counts of individual species or in the suite of
   species present between experienced-experienced pairs and
   experienced-novice pairs. Nevertheless, novices tended to count fewer
   birds of most target species than experienced observers. These
   differences were significant for Red-eyed Vireo, Rose-breasted Grosbeak
   and Scarlet Tanager in 1995 but only for Rose-breasted Grosbeak in 1996.
   Of the nine novices who participated in both years, all improved their
   pre-training ability to identify the target species (from a tape)
   between 1995 and 1996. The counts of Red-eyed Vireos (the only species
   with a sample size large enough to test) were significantly lower than
   the counts of the experienced observers in 1995 bur not in 1996. We
   conclude that trained and tested novice observers can provide credible
   data for a carefully selected subset of species.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance that stimulates aspen regeneration and
   expansion in the western United States. We investigated the impacts of
   burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the
   western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure,
   breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were
   compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each
   pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site.
   Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag
   densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45
   diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus
   sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected
   significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds
   (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected
   significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers
   (Vermivora celata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and
   chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned
   aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many
   other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect
   meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned
   aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird
   species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs,
   but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition
   in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.}},

Abstract = {{Decoy traps have been widely used to trap waterfowl, but trap bias has
   rarely been examined. Likewise, researchers often radio-mark animals
   with the implicit assumptions that (1) radio-marked individuals are
   representative of the population and (2) transmitters do not alter
   behavior or other measures of interest. In this paper, we quantified
   possible trap bias, and combined effects of capture and radio-marking,
   on attributes and reproduction of female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta).
   We found no difference in the age distribution or size of decoy-trapped
   versus nest-trapped female pintails. However, radio-marked females
   tended to lq fewer eggs than unmarked females. When analyses were
   restricted to first nests only, clutch-initiation dates did not differ
   between radio-marked and unmarked females. The number of ducklings
   hatched did not differ between radio-marked and unmarked females.
   Although we did not detect age or size differences between birds caught
   in decoy traps and those nest-trapped, it is unclear if either group is
   completely representative of the population. However, pintails were
   difficult to capture with decoy traps and the method was time and labor
   intensive. Om results suggest that the combined effects of trapping and
   marking may negatively affect some aspects of reproduction in pintails.}},

   analyses selected wing chord and tail length as the most parsimonious
   subset of variables for discriminating sex. This two-variable model
   correctly classified 80\% of females and 97\% of males used to develop
   the model. Validation of the model using 19 individuals from Louisiana
   and Virginia resulted in 100\% correct classification of males and
   females. This model provides criteria for sexing monomorphic Acadian
   Flycatchers during the breeding season and possibly during the winter.}},

Abstract = {{We modified a subcutaneous anchor attachment and achieved transmitter
   retention times that exceeded those reported previously for other
   attachments used on alcids. Traditional suture and epoxy attachment
   methods were used on Xantus' Murrelets in 1995 and 1996, while the
   modified attachment was used for Xantus' Murrelets in 1996 and 1997 and
   Marbled Murrelets in 1997. Modifications included use of an inhalant
   anesthetic, placing the anchor in a more cranial position on the back,
   application of marine epoxy, and place ment of a single subcutaneous
   non-absorbable suture at the caudal end of the radio to hold the radio
   in place initially. We located 22 of 56 (39\%) Xantus' Murrelets
   radio-marked using suture and epoxy during aerial surveys in 1995 and
   1996. Of birds radio-marked using the subcutaneous anchor attachment, we
   located 92 of 113 (81\%) Xantus' Murrelets marked in 1996 and 1997 and
   all 28 (100\%) Marbled Murrelets marked in 1997 during aerial surveys.
   The maximum confirmed duration for the subcutaneous anchor transmitter
   attachment was 51 d for Xantus' Murrelets and 78 d for Marbled Murrelets
   versus 41 d for the suture and epoxy attachment wed on Xantus'
   Murrelets. Recapture rates of radio-marked Xantus' Murrelets were
   similar to recapture rates of unmarked Xantus' Murrelets. Our
   post-release observations indicated negligible short-term physical
   effects from the attachment procedure, while telemetry data and
   examination of recaptured murrelets indicated no evidence of infection
   or other long-term physical effects. Breeding behavior of some murrelets
   was not disrupted; however, further evaluation of potential effects of
   this attachment technique on breeding and behavior is needed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied nest site and habitat characteristics associated with 75
   Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) nests in Connecticut, northern New
   Jersey, and southeastern New York. Nest sites were categorized as either
   urban (30) or rural (45) and were compared to data from available
   habitat (24 random sites for microhabitat; 70 random sites for
   macrohabitat). Urban nest trees were significantly larger in diameter
   and taller than rural nest trees, and accordingly, nests were higher in
   urban nest trees as well. Urban nest sites were significantly different
   than random sites for all eight habitat variables, but rural nests were
   significantly different for only five variables. Urban nests were
   significantly different than rural nests for five of eight habitat
   variables. Only urban owl nests had significantly lower site basal area,
   higher conifer composition, and lower shrub cover. Both urban and rural
   owl nests showed lower canopy cover and closer proximity to forest edge,
   paved roads, human habitation, and water than random sites. Although
   both urban and rural Great Horned Owls demonstrated habitat selection
   (use different from availability),urban owls showed a stronger degree of
   selection, probably because of the greater complexity of habitats
   available in the urban landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We made regular field observations over three winters of first-year
   Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus smithsonianus), Thayer's Gulls (L.
   thayeri), and Glaucous-winged Gulls (L. glaucescens) in order to
   document the timing of first prebasic molts. The first prebasic molt of
   North American Herring Gulls starts between September and February. Most
   resident birds on the Atlantic coast undergo extensive first prebasic
   molt by late November, while some migrants wintering in California do
   not start molt until January or later. The onset of first prebasic molt
   in 90\% of Thayer's Gulls is not until January or later, and some birds
   migrating north in March appear to be still in juvenal plumage.
   Initiation of first prebasic molt in Glaucous-winged Gulls spans late
   October to March, such that some birds have largely finished molting
   before others start. Our findings differ from or clarify those of
   previous authors. We suggest that differences in molt timings within and
   among taxa of large gulls reflect the nature of their migrations.
   Largely resident or short-distance migrant populations can start molt up
   to several months earlier than those populations that undertake longer
   migrations. Most molt studies rely heavily upon specimens. However,
   while museum collections may have adequate series of passerines, this is
   rarely true of larger birds such as gulls. Critical field observations
   of species that lend themselves to field study, in combination with
   documentary photographs and judicious collection of voucher specimens,
   can more easily provide adequate samples to follow molt in a population.}},

Abstract = {{During a 7-yr study on Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) in
   southern Spain, I banded 1072 birds. Of these, 0.6\% had natural leg
   injuries when first captured. Of 412 plovers that were recaptured or
   resighted in years following banding, 1.9\% had injuries caused by the
   metal band, the most common of which was foot loss. All these birds had
   the metal band on the tarsus, and no plover with metal band on the tibia
   was recaptured with injuries. Though foot losses did not prevent
   breeding, and leg injuries probably had little effects on population
   dynamics, it is recommended that metal banding of shorebirds on the
   tarsus should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and White
   Ibis (E. albus) is well known from sites in North America, the
   Caribbean, and the Venezuelan Ilanos, but few data are available on the
   status or breeding patterns of die populations that inhabit South
   American mangroves. From 1992-1997, we monitored the status of a colony
   off: ruber in an area of mangrove in northern Brazil. The breeding
   population numbered 2000-3400 pairs. We did not find any significant
   population fluctuations between years; apparently, most birds attempted
   to breed each year, in contrast with freshwater-breeding populations.
   Clutch size was 1.97 +/- 0.17, lower than at more northern saltwater
   sites. The low variability of clutch size was surprising, Whole nest
   failure from catastrophic events such as storms, human predation, and
   nest desertion was responsible for most egg and nestling mortality.
   Partial mortality was rare. Singleton eggs and nestlings were frequently
   abandoned by adults following the loss of an egg or nestling. We
   conclude that this population pursued a strategy of brood survival
   rather than brood reduction which is usually observed in Eudocimus. This
   may have resulted from stable resource availability at this site. Given
   that northern populations often do not breed in unfavorable years,
   selection appears to have favored adult survival over reproductive
   capacity in this species. Human disturbance was intense, and it can
   threaten ibis populations both through direct predation and induction of
   nest desertion.}},

Abstract = {{The size and shape of the black bib in Black-capped Chickadees varies
   among individuals and may signal information about age and sex, as found
   in other species with similar plumage badges. By photographing and
   measuring bibs of wintering adults in an Ontario population in 1994 and
   returning adults in 1995, we correlated bib area, perimeter, and amount
   of white breast feathers interdigitating into the lower edge of the bib
   (raggedness) with age and sex of birds. Only bib area showed any
   tendency to be sexually dimorphic; females tended to have smaller bib
   areas than males. By contrast, raggedness of the bottom of the bib
   appears to be related to age, rather than sex; raggedness was greater in
   hatching-year birds than in after-hatching-year birds. Bib morphology of
   individuals also showed year effects, independent of age. Individual
   birds from 1994 that were rephotographed in 1995 had more ragged bibs in
   1995. Hatching-year birds in 1995 also had more ragged bibs than 1994
   hatching-year birds. Consistent differences between years in the degree
   of bib raggedness suggest that bib morphology could reflect differences
   in resources at the time of molt.}},

Abstract = {{Although drumming (striking the substrate with the bill rapidly and
   repetitively) and tapping (striking the substrate regularly and at
   slower rates) are thought to play important roles in waodpecker
   communication, questions remain concerning the specific function(s) of
   these signals. To gain insight into the possible functions of drumming
   and tapping by male and female Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes
   carolinus), we examined the use of these signals among different
   contexts and breeding stages. Only males were observed drumming, and
   rates were highest prior to pairing. Such timing suggests that drumming
   may be used to attract potential mates. Males also drummed during
   territorial intrusions by and boundary disputes with conspecific males,
   suggesting an aggressive or territorial function. Overall, drumming
   rates were relatively low ((x) over bar = 0.35/h), perhaps because a
   frequently used ((x) over bar = 12.5/h) vocal signal (kwirr call) serves
   similar functions and may encode more potential information. Male and
   female Red-bellied woodpeckers tapped and mutual tapped at low rates
   ((x) over bar = 0.36/h and 0.09/h, respectively). These signals were
   used only at nest cavities, and rates were highest during the
   pre-pairing and post-pairing/pre-nesting periods. Such use suggests that
   tapping and mutual tapping play a role in establishing and maintaining
   pair bonds and in nest site selection.}},

Abstract = {{Using mist nets. we examined the distribution of resident and migratory
   birds in nine Carolina bays (<1.0 to >80 ha) in Bladen County, North
   Carolina. We analyzed the influence of bay area, isolation, and
   landscape on species richness and relative abundance. Area accounted for
   greater than 60\% of the variation in species richness among bays.
   Adjacent habitat also strongly influenced species richness (R-2 = 0.47).
   When considered individually, adjacent landscape was the only variable
   that weakly influenced relative abundance (R-2 = 0.28). The situation of
   bays within a broad habitat matrix and uniqueness as forested wetland
   depressions attracted a diversity of species. This study establishes
   Carolina bays as breeding habitat for several Neotropical migrants
   regarded as interior specialists and experiencing population declines

Abstract = {{Historically the Swallow-tailed Kite (Elanoides forficatus) bred in the
   United States in at least 16 eastern states. Currently it is restricted
   to seven southeastern states, with most of its breeding range in
   Florida. Breeding Bird Surveys indicate a declining trend for this
   Neotropical migrant in most of Florida. Using a rapid survey technique
   at the Lower Suwannee NWR on 25-27 Mar. 1997, we scanned for kites from
   16 sampling stations above the forest canopy, using 10x binoculars for
   45 min per station. An effective detection distance of 2.4 km provided
   almost complete coverage of kite habitat (excluding salt marsh) on the
   refuge (14,620 ha) and in a 1.6-km buffer (13,526 ha). A mobile
   observation platform, extended to heights of 30-34 m provided an
   unobstructed view above the forest canopy where foraging bouts, feeding,
   courtship displays, and other activities by this species occur. This
   technique was found to be efficient in obtaining an estimate of
   potential breeding pairs. An estimated 19 breeding pairs were observed,
   with possibly five additional pairs, a density of at least one pair per
   1173-1407 ha. There was no opportunity to search for nests so we were
   unable to correlate number of active nests with the number of kites
   observed, and linear nature of study area might concentrate birds,
   including nonbreeders, so our density of kites may or may not be typical
   for other areas. The refuge has a mosaic of 11 different habitats (7
   forest types, freshwater and salt marshes, open water and
   urban/suburban) providing much linear edge to the matrix of different
   plant communities that range in height from less than 1 m to greater
   than 30 m. Such structure provides quality habitat for Swallow-tailed
   Kites.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that terms can be affected by
   kleptoparasitism from gulls. During 1992 and 1993 we studied
   kleptoparasitism at a mixed-species colony of Kelp Gulls (Larus
   dominicanus), Royal Terns (Sterna maxima), and Cayenne Terns (S.
   eurygnatha) at Punta Leon, Chubut, Argentina. Robbing behavior did not
   involve aerial chases. Kelp Gulls remained at the ternery periphery and
   stole food from adults flying low over the colony with food intended for
   chicks, from adult terms on the ground transferring food to their
   chicks, or from chicks. The percentage of food robbed by Kelp Gulls from
   both tern species was 8.8\% of food brought to the colony (n = 1131).
   Robbing efficiency was 58\%. Kelp Gulls robbed significantly more food
   from Royal than Cayenne Terns (10.6 vs. 3.6\%, respectively). The
   percentage of robbing attempts was also larger on Royal than Cayenne
   Terns (18.9 vs. 5.7\%). Robbing efficiency, however, was similar for
   both tern species (56 and 63.2\% for Royal and Cayenne Terns,
   respectively). Kleptoparasitism on Royal Terns within the colony was

Abstract = {{From 557 recoveries of nestling Great Horned Owls banded in Saskatchewan
   and 152 banded in Alberta, 176 from Saskatchewan and 51 from Alberta
   were recovered in an exact month >12 mo post-banding. The mean dispersal
   distance was 149 km (Saskatchewan, 154 km and Alberta, 131 km). For the
   five months, April-August, considered to best reflect natal dispersal,
   the mean dispersal was 75 km; separate median distances for each of
   these months ranged from 39 to 50 km, equivalent to the width of ten owl
   territories in average habitat.
   I compared calendar years of peak snowshoe hare numbers, 1958-1960,
   1967-1970, and 1978-1981, with intervening years of low hare density,
   and with 1985-1994 when no hare cycle was apparent. At times of low hare
   density, owls of all ages travel great distances in fall and winter in a
   remarkably consistent southeast direction. Median dispersal distances
   were 43 km in high hare years, 56.5 km in low hare years and 72 km in
   noncyclic years. But in high hare years the only three owls to travel
   >100 km went northwest or northeast, opposite to the direction in low
   hare years.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Artificial nests monitored with automatically triggered cameras were
   used to determine the intensity of nest predation and the identity of
   nest predators in linear remnants and large remnants of woodland in the
   wheatbelt of New South Wales, Australia. Nests were constructed from
   wire, grass, and bark to mimic those of the Red-capped Robin (Petroica
   goodenovii) and were stocked with eggs made from modelling clay. The
   incidence of predation was significantly higher in linear remnants (62\%
   predation) than in large remnants (34\%). Forty-seven independent
   photographic events were recorded, and nine species of bird accounted
   for all predation. Two species of predator, the Grey Shrike-thrush
   (Colluricincla harmonica) and the Grey Butcherbird (Cracticus
   torquatus), were responsible for 70\% of predation and were detected at
   nests in both linear and large remnants. The remaining seven species of
   predator were detected only at nests in linear remnants. Bird surveys
   conducted in the same sites revealed that of the species of predator
   identified from photographs all, with two exceptions, were present in
   both linear remnants and large remnants. However, the abundance of
   identified predators was significantly higher in linear remnants. This
   study suggests that linear strips of vegetation, despite providing
   habitat in which birds can live, or a conduit through which they can
   move, may have limited value as breeding habitat. The current enthusiasm
   for protection and creation of corridors should not be at the expense of
   restoration and sympathetic management of large areas of native
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Early hatching and intense begging by nestling Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) have been hypothesized to reduce host incubation
   attentiveness, thereby extending the incubation periods of host eggs and
   ultimately increasing the competitive advantage of the cowbird chick. We
   tested this hypothesis by adding newly hatched cowbirds to Yellow
   Warbler (Dendroica petechia) clutches one day prior to their predicted
   hatch date, and observing whether the presence of the cowbird nestling
   brought about changes in parental behavior during the hatching period.
   The presence of a cowbird nestling did not significantly alter female
   nest attentiveness relative to control clutches. The presence of a
   cowbird nestling did not significantly increase the rate at which either
   the female or male Yellow Warbler delivered food to the nest. Female
   Yellow Warblers tended to feed food delivered to the nest by the male to
   a cowbird nestling more frequently than to a warbler nestling, but the
   difference only approached significance. The presence of a cowbird
   nestling resulted in significantly longer Yellow Warbler incubation
   periods for only the third egg to hatch in the clutch. Host clutches
   with a cowbird nestling experienced decreased hatching success and
   increased frequency of egg disappearance, but the difference in nestling
   mortality only approached significance. Our data indicate minimal
   alteration of host behavior by the cowbird nestling during the hatching
   period. Although the detrimental effect of the cowbird nestling is
   measurable by the end of the hatching period, its full effect,
   especially for small hosts, does not manifest itself until later in the
   nestling and fledgling periods.}},

   overestimation, while those based on total gosling counts may result in

Abstract = {{We used radio telemetry from 1990-1994 to compare reproduction of 185
   female pheasants in a diverse landscape with 25\% perennial grassland
   habitat in Pale Alto County, Iowa, with that of 72 pheasants on an
   intensively farmed landscape with 9\% grassland in Kossuth County, Iowa.
   Median dates of the beginning of incubation of first nests were almost
   identical on the areas, hut median incubation date of renests was
   earlier at Pale Alto (22 June) than at Kossuth (5 July). Mean clutch
   size in first nests was 12.6 eggs, which was greater than clutch size of
   9.9 for renesting attempts. Success of first nests was 57.3\% at Pale
   Alto and 44.8\% at Kossuth, whereas success of renests was 45.6\% at
   Pale Alto but only 26.9\% at Kossuth. Linear logistic regression
   revealed that nest success averaged 62.3\% in undisturbed blocks of
   habitat such as CRF versus 44.8\% in small, linear, or disturbed
   habitats, regardless of the study landscape. Hen success averaged 70.6\%
   at Pale Alto and 52.2\% at Kossuth, and it varied more among years at
   Kossuth. Pheasant nest success was higher in a diversified agricultural
   landscape with large blocks of undisturbed habitat. When nesting is
   restricted to small or disturbed habitat fragments pheasant reproduction
   is probably reduced enough to limit the potential rate of population
   increase.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a leg-noose for capturing adult Black-legged Kittiwakes
   (Rissa tridactyla), a cliff-nesting, colonial seabird. The capture
   device consisted of an adjustable wire base secured to the rim of the
   nest. The base is simple to construct, and we describe three design
   options. The base held open a circular noose that was used to snare a
   kittiwake around the tarsometatarsi. A spool of line attached to the
   noose permitted the capturer to move away from the colony, encouraging
   the birds' return. Using this device, we captured 75 kittiwakes in 1996
   and 1997. In particular, the leg-noose proved invaluable in the safe
   capture and recapture of specific individuals for our study that could
   not be captured by noose-pole. This leg-noose concept is versatile and
   could be adapted for capture of other nesting avian species.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{404-413}},
Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{Due to projected demands for hardwood timber, development of
   silvicultural practices that provide for adequate regeneration in
   southeastern bottomland hardwoods without causing undue harm to wildlife
   resources is critical. Group-selection silviculture involves harvesting
   a small group of trees, which creates a canopy gap (usually <2 ha in
   size). Our objectives were to determine the extent of use of
   group-selection harvest gaps by fall migrant birds, to compare
   experimentally use of three sizes of gaps (10-m, 20-m, and 40-m radius),
   and to compare use of locations within gaps (center, edge, and adjacent
   forest). We captured 210 birds of 36 species in 1692 mist-net. hours.
   Total captures were greater in 40-m radius gaps than in 20- and 10-m
   radius gaps and were greater in gap centers than at gap edges and
   adjacent forest. Forest interior/interior-edge Neotropical migrants and
   interior-edge short-distance migrants were captured most often in the
   centers of the largest gaps. We captured no interior-edge short-distance
   migrants or field-edge birds of any migratory group in the adjacent
   forest. A threshold gap size determining use by migrant birds may exist
   between 20 and 40 m in radius. Though reasons for greater capture
   success in gaps are unclear, forest interior Neotropical and
   short-distance migrants apparently shifted their habitat preferences
   during fall to include forest gap habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the abundance and productivity of songbirds in prescribed
   burned and unburned mature (>60 yr) pine forests at Piedmont National
   Wildlife Refuge, Georgia, during 1993-1995. We estimated species
   abundance, richness, and evenness using data from 312 point counts in 18
   burned sites and sis unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features
   in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated
   productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting
   species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn
   sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and
   unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts,
   we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were
   detected greater than or equal to 10\% of the counts in either habitat
   class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred
   unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for
   burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over
   unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned
   sites. Productivity; estimates were low in burned sites. One or more
   eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an avenge of only
   0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the
   most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45\% in the
   Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64\% in the Summer Tanager
   (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are
   unknown, future research should address this issue.}},

Abstract = {{The American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) is a sexually dichromatic falcon
   that exhibits considerable individual plumage variability. For example,
   the anterior extent of the black dorsal barring in juvenile males has
   been used throughout North America as one of several aging criteria, but
   recent data demonstrate that the variability among individual
   Southeastern American Kestrels (F. S. paulus) exceeds that accounted for
   by age. The objective of this study was to search for geographic
   patterns in the variability of juvenal plumage, particularly those
   characteristics considered indicative of age. Nestling kestrels (n =
   610) were examined prior to fledging during the 1997 breeding season at
   nest box programs across a large portion of the North American breeding
   range. From south to north (1) the crown patches of both males and
   females become more completely rufous, and (2) shaft streaks on forehead
   and crown feathers become more pronounced, especially in males. Male
   Southeastern American Kestrels differed from other males (F. s.
   sparverius) in that the anterior extent of dorsal barring averaged less
   but was more variable. The variability observed in North America appears
   to be part of a dine extending across the species range in the Western
   Hemisphere, where tropical subspecies are small and have reduced dorsal
   barring. Both body size and, especially in males, dorsal barring
   increases with increasing north and south latitude. We suggest that this
   geographic pattern is adaptive in terms of thermoregulation, and that
   differences in the sex roles may explain why males become less barred
   with maturity while females do not.}},

Abstract = {{We used high-frequency surveillance radar as a non-intrusive method to
   census nocturnal burrow-nesting Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus
   aleuticus) on the world's largest colony, Triangle Island, British
   Columbia. In the largest subcolony, West Bay, the radar unit was
   operated 2200-0510 h nightly from 30 Apr.-11 May 1996 during the onset
   of hatching. Radar images were stored on video cassette for subsequent
   image analysis. We report total nightly activity based upon cumulative
   samples from the tapes at 30-s intervals to determine the percent of
   bird activity within a fixed area. Estimates of the average image size
   of an individual bird were used to develop conservative counts of birds
   in the sample area. Activity at the colony began approximately 1.5 h
   after sunset and ended at least 15 min before sunrise. Activity levels
   increased over the study period and showed considerably nightly
   variation. Nightly activity was continuous at low levels through the
   sampling period from 30 Apr. to 3 May. Late evening peaks of activity
   around 2300 h were evident and tended to increase in intensity from 3
   May onward. Nightly activity at the colony was correlated with the
   number of chicks hatched the following day. The maximum estimate of
   individual birds detected was 156,327 on 10 May. Radar has great
   potential to elucidate patterns of seasonal activity We contrast and
   evaluate the use of radar and traditional methods based on burrow counts
   and identify several major advantages for radar in long-term population
   monitoring and seabird research programs.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of audio-lures on capture patterns of migrant Northern
   Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) was assessed. The majority of new owls
   were captured within 12 m of the lure and capture frequencies decreased
   with increasing distance away from the lure. Recaptures tended to occur
   farther away from the audio-lure than new captures. Capture locations of
   foreign retrapped owls, however, were not significantly different than
   new owls. Although capture locations did not differ between adult and
   immature owls, there was a detectable size bias in the distribution of
   capture locations. Smaller owls tended to be caught farther away from
   the lure than larger owls. Our results demonstrate that when an
   audio-lure is used, a small number of mist nets is sufficient to capture
   substantial numbers of Northern Saw-whet Owls. However, studies
   targeting recaptures may benefit from the use of more nets spaced over a
   larger area.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to trap and mark individuals is important for the ecological
   study of wild populations of the Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis spp.).
   Techniques for the live-capture of Houbara Bustards used on breeding
   birds or at high population densities may not be suitable for
   non-breeding birds at low density. We review eight trapping methods, six
   of which have been used with varying success on wild Houbara Bustards in
   northern and central Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates, and in
   Kazakhstan. Baited cages and nets were ineffective at low bustard
   densities. Lines of snares are worth using in areas where the movements
   of Houbara Bustards are predictable. Snares carry a low risk of causing
   injury or death and may be most effective at higher Houbara Bustard
   densities, for use on breeding bustards faithful to nest or display
   sites and which can be attracted to decoys, or for the recapture of
   radio-tagged birds. Cannon nets, clap nets, and net guns also require
   that Houbara Bustard location can be predicted or influenced, but carry
   greater risk of injury to the bird and therefore little advantage over
   the use of snares. The use of trained falcon may carry a high risk of
   injury to Houbara Bustards, but this is markedly reduced when the falcon
   is fitted with claw and beak covers, and where the terrain allows the
   falconer to move rapidly to the site of capture. Unrestrained falcons
   should not be used for the live capture of Houbara Bustards. The use of
   disarmed falcons is justified only where other capture methods are
   forbidden, or when recreational falconers can be persuaded to co-operate
   with researchers. Unfledged Houbara Bustard chicks are most easily
   caught by hand.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the performance of two models of satellite transmitters and
   two types of attachments to track Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens
   atlantica) from their Arctic breeding grounds to their wintering areas
   along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Six birds were fitted dth
   a Toyocom T-2038 attached with a back-mounted harness (141 g, vertical
   upward antenna) in 1993, 5 with a back-mounted Telonics ST-10 (116 g,
   horizontal antenna) in 1994, and 11 with a Telonics ST-10 fixed on a
   neck collar (99 g, vertical downward antenna) in 1995. The transmitters
   represented 3.5-5.2\% of goose body mass. All transmitters operated on a
   84-96 s repetition period with a duty cycle of 8 h on and 16 h off and
   were tracked using the Argos system. Six birds tall dth harness
   attachment were shot by hunters; 12 could not be tracked for the entire
   migration because of mortality, radio loss, or radio failure; 4 tall
   with neck collar attachment reached the wintering grounds. Overall, we
   obtained 2.4-7.2 locations/goose/day with a greater number at higher
   latitudes than at lower ones. In 1993, 75\% of locations had a quality
   class (LC) greater than or equal to 1, while only 18-20\% of locations
   were similarly classified in 1994-1995. We could not evaluate the
   relative effect of the antenna orientation and the intrinsic
   characteristics of the transmitters on the PTT performance and location
   quality. The difference between true and estimated locations ranged on
   average between 1.4 km for LC 2 to 23 km for LC B. Geese fitted with
   harnesses spent more time in comfort movements than unmarked birds. We
   recommend that harnesses be avoided for geese. Satellite telemetry is
   adequate to track long-distant movements of migrants or to locate
   unknown critical areas (breeding, wintering, etc.) but not for detailed
   studies on habitat use or local movements.}},

Abstract = {{We contrasted the estimated age class of recaptured Harlequin Ducks
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) (n = 255) based on bursal depth with
   expected age class based on bursal depth at first capture and time since
   first capture. Although neither estimated nor expected ages can be
   assumed to be correct, rates of discrepancies between the two for within
   year recaptures indicate sampling error, while between-year recaptures
   test assumptions about rates of bursal involution. Within-year between
   year, and overall discrepancy rates were 10\%, 24\%, and 18\%,
   respectively. Most (86\%) between-year discrepancies occurred for birds
   expected to be after-third-year (ATT) but estimated to be third-year
   (TY). Of these ATY-TY discrepancies, 22 of 29 (88\%) birds had bursal
   depths of 2 or 3 mm. Further, five of six between year recaptures chat
   were known to be ATY but estimated to be TY had 2 mm bursas.
   Reclassifying birds with 2 or 3 mm bursas as ATY resulted in reduction
   in between-year (24\% to 10\%) and overall (18\% to 11\%) discrepancy
   rates. We conclude that age determination of Harlequin Ducks based on
   bursal depth, particularly using our modified criteria, is a relatively
   consistent and reliable technique.}},

   1996 and one of 18 nests in 1997. Because of the possibility of reuse,
   investigators monitoring Willow Flycatcher nests should consider
   re-examining previously used nests if a new nest can not be found for a

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{214-229}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Growth rates of young geese are among the fastest of any bird with
   precocial young. Gosling growth also varies significantly in response to
   even small variations in the quantity and quality of food. As such, it
   is important to be able to assess gosling age precisely to separate
   age-dependent growth from other factors. In some studies, where goslings
   are individually marked at hatching, gosling age can be assigned
   precisely (age = encounter date - marking date). However, this process
   is time-consuming and expensive, and the encounter rate of marked
   goslings can be low. In such cases, some researchers have made use of
   one or more body size measures as a surrogate for true age. We examined
   the utility of using body size to estimate gosling age, using a large
   data set for which true age is known. We show that some characters, most
   notably feather length, are highly correlated with true age, but using
   these characters to predict gosling age may introduce significant biases
   into typical analyses, which may reduce statistical power to an
   unacceptable degree.}},

   Mauritius Kestrels, one located in a traditional location and the other
   in a new nest cavity at the edge of agricultural fields and other
   non-native vegetation. Kestrel home ranges were determined by radio
   tracking. Habitat types were identified using overstory canopies only.
   Native vegetation composed 12-41\% of kestrel home range area, with
   exotic woodland, agricultural land, and scrub composing 15-40\%.
   Kestrels were observed taking prey from non-native habitats, and both

Abstract = {{The bright coloration of plastic leg bands used in avian research has
   been shown to affect the social interactions of birds by augmenting the
   ornamentation that traditionally mediates intersexual mate choice and/or
   intrasexual competition for mates. With ultraviolet (UV) vision and
   plumage reflectance playing a role in the mating decisions of some
   species, it would seem important to examine the UV reflectance
   properties of colored bands, as these bands may be providing strong and
   meaningful UV color signals that are invisible to the human eye and are
   potentially unaccounted for in most avian behavioral studies. In this
   study, we used a fiber optic spectrometer and a UV/visible light source
   to collect spectral reflectance data for the commonly used types and
   colors of bands and showed that none exhibit peak reflectance values
   throughout the range of UV wavelengths that is visible to birds.
   Instead, UV reflectance of colored bands at these wavelengths is
   comparable to levels of background reflectance found elsewhere in the
   avian visible spectrum. Consequently, colored bands lack discrete US'
   color signals and can safely be used in studies of wild birds with a
   minimal risk of influencing intraspecific signaling that is based on
   ultraviolet ornamentation. However, caution must be exercised when using
   these bands under experimental conditions, as certain treatments (e.g.,
   indoor lighting, one-way glass, sunscreens) may mask the background
   levels of UV reflectance that still contribute to the overall band
   color, effectively inducing a color change in the bands that could
   provide unnatural visual cues to the birds and unintentionally influence
   their social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We documented extrusion and loss of abdominally implanted radio
   transmitters with percutaneous antennas from adult female Harlequin
   Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). Birds were captured during wing molt
   (late August to mid-September) in 1995-1997. Of 44 Harlequin Ducks
   implanted with radios and recaptured, 7 (16\%) had lost their
   transmitters and 5 (11\%) had radios in the process of extruding. Most
   (11 of 12) extrusions and losses occurred in birds implanted with radios
   in 1996 and recaptured in 1997. We suggest that transmitter extrusions
   and losses were due largely to changes in transmitter design made
   between 1995 and 1996. Transmitters implanted in 1996 were cylindrical
   rather than spherical, had a flat end with an abrupt edge, and the lower
   portion of the antenna was reinforced. Radio losses occurred after the
   7-mo monitoring period and caused no apparent harm to the birds.
   Investigators using implanted radios with percutaneous antennas for
   long-term projects should be aware of the potential for radio extrusion
   and should minimize the problem by using transmitters that have no sharp
   edges and that are wide, rather than narrow.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial nests are widely used in avian field studies. However, it is
   unclear how well predation rates on artificial nests reflect predation
   rates on natural nests. Therefore, we compared survival rates of
   artificial nests (unused natural nests baited with House Sparrow eggs)
   with survival rates of active bird nests in the same habitat at the same
   sites. Survival rates of artificial nests (27.7\%) were significantly
   lower than nest survival rates of natural nests (58.6\%). Logistic
   regression analysis indicated that the inclusion of an index of nest
   concealment in addition to nest type (natural or artificial)
   significantly increased the amount of the variability in nest predation
   accounted for by the regression. However, because the relationship
   between nest survival and nest type (natural or artificial) was still
   highly significant even with nest concealment included in the model, we
   conclude that higher rates of nest predation on artificial nests were
   not entirely due to the greater conspicuousness of artificial nests. We
   suggest that lack of parental defense is an additional contributing
   factor responsible for higher predation rates on artificial nests and,
   therefore, is likely to be a potential confounding factor in future nest
   predation experiments using artificial nests.}},

Abstract = {{We studied within-year survival of Snail Kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis)
   over a 3-yr period to determine the time required for survivorship of
   juvenile kites to become similar to adults. We also were interested in
   how the risk of mortality changes over time for each age class, which
   carl further our understanding of what factors influence survival.
   Juvenile Snail Kites experienced a period of relatively high risk for
   their first four months after fledging, after which survivorship became
   similar to adults. This initial period of high risk corresponded to the
   time that fledglings were becoming independent of their parents,
   foraging on their own, and dispersing into unfamiliar areas. Adults
   experienced their highest risk, which was less than that of juveniles,
   during the winter and early spring. We offer several hypotheses about
   why this period of highest risk for adults might correspond to a time of
   lower food availability and/or increased risk of predation.}},

Abstract = {{We describe traps designed for the trapping of particular individual
   parent birds during the nestling phase of the breeding cycle. These
   traps have been used successfully with large cup-nesting birds (egrets)
   and small cavity-nesting birds (House Sparrows). The common features
   shared include a dropping wire door that prevents escape and an
   electronic radio-release triggering mechanism chat allows the researcher
   to control the precise moment of capture from a considerable distance
   away The radio technology is modified from commercially available units
   developed for remote-control toy craft. The sparrow trap includes a
   mechanical motion-amplifier, adapted from a standard rat-trap. Both
   traps have been successfully field tested many dozens of times and
   currently result in captures on approximately 90\% of attempts.}},

   7.1-29\% of adult males and 12.5-25\% of adult females changed
   territories between breeding seasons. The median breeding dispersal
   distance of 12 birds (7 males, 2 females, and 3 of unknown sex) was 370
   m (range 110-560 m). Four fledglings dispersed a median distance of 490
   m from their natal nests to breeding territories (range 300-2030 m). The

Abstract = {{The number of birds killed (per km) by collision with power lines in
   west-central Spain did not differ between one transmission line and two
   distribution lines. For all three power lines, we tested the ability of
   different markers to reduce bird collision by comparing marked spans to
   unmarked spans along the same power line. A spiral (30 cm x 100 cm)
   reduced collisions (static wire marking). Black crossed bands (35 cm x 5
   cm) were also effective, but not for the vulnerable Great Bustard (Otis
   tarda) (conductor marking). The third marker, consisting of thin black
   stripes (70 cm x 0.8 cm), did not reduce mortality (conductor marking).
   The highest mortality from power-line collision was recorded for the
   Great and Little Bustard (Otis tarda and Otis tetrax).}},

   Mean wing chord increased considerably from age 1 to 2 and increased

Abstract = {{The role of chip calls in the winter territoriality of Yellow Warblers
   (Dendroica petechia) was studied in the Republic of Panama. There was
   extensive variation through the day in chip rates and time spent
   chipping, with vocalizations greatest in the morning (0630-0830 h) and
   at dusk (1730-1830 h). A bout of rapid chipping at dusk was observed in
   several birds. Individuals responded aggressively to playbacks of chip
   calls by increasing chip rate and flying close to playback speakers.
   Yellow Warblers responded significantly more aggressively to chip calls
   of conspecifics than those of a control (Northern Waterthrush, Seiurus
   noveboracensis). Results suggest that Yellow Warbler chip vocalizations
   function in defense of winter territories. The role of the conspicuous
   dusk chipping bout remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{The nests of Celeus spectabilis (Rufous-headed Woodpecker) and
   Cercomacra manu (Manu Antbird) are described. These are the first
   published descriptions of the nests of these species, both of which are
   restricted to thickets of spiny bamboo (Guadua weberbaueri) in
   southwestern Amazonia. The nest of the woodpecker, a hole placed 2.8 m
   high in a soft-wooded dead tree, was similar to the nests of other
   species in the genus. The nest was in an area of almost pure bamboo. The
   nest of the antbird, also in a dense bamboo thicker, was a pensile pouch
   suspended by the nest rim. The nest was 3.5 m high and attached to small
   bamboo branches. The previously defined groups in the genus (the
   tyrannina group and the nigricans group) may differ in nest structure,
   although comparative material is scant.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation structure of Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis)
   breeding habitat and its relationship to home range size was studied on
   pine plantations in central Arkansas. Univariate and multivariate
   analyses showed that breeding areas had less litter, fewer trees and
   shrubs, shorter woody vegetation, and more forbs than unoccupied sites.
   Few differences in density of ground vegetation and cover were found
   between occupied and unoccupied sites. Size of home range was negatively
   correlated with percent forb cover, percent ground cover, forb height,
   percent grass col er, and vertical vegetation density between 0-90 cm,
   but was positively related to percent canopy cover. Management practices
   that reduce litter, maintain relatively low tree and shrub densities,
   and that encourage the growth of forbs and cespitose grasses (e.g.,
   Andropogon and Aristida) are recommended. Stands that are thinned and
   periodically burned may provide the most suitable habitat.}},

   However, we also documented the presence of Salmonella, a known

Abstract = {{I recorded behaviors and estimated energy intake and expenditures of 16
   Belted Kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon) during January and February 1994.
   Each bird was watched for an entire day to examine the relationships
   among temperature, time of day and foraging behavior. Estimates of total
   daily energy intake and expenditure differed by only 2.8 +/- 42.9KJ/d
   (1\% of total). The relatively large amount of variation in this
   difference may indicate that kingfishers are balancing their energy
   budgets on time scales longer than a single day or may simply reflect
   the coarseness of the methods used to derive these estimates. There was
   a significant decline in energy expenditure through the day, due largely
   to a decrease in the cost of thermoregulation. There was, however, no
   significant variation in energy intake among times of day Mean daily
   temperature was not correlated with the total daily energy balance
   (intake minus expenditure) of individuals. Perching, flying, and
   foraging behaviors of Belted Kingfishers varied by time of day In
   general, Belted Kingfishers were more active in the afternoon than in
   the morning. In summary these observations indicate that there are
   predictable diel patterns in the foraging behaviors of Belted
   Kingfishers, that the energy intake resulting from these behaviors is
   variable, and this variability in energy intake is not correlated with
   daily temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that singing by male passerines may serve a
   variety of functions, including, by not limited to, mate attraction and
   territory defense. Examination of singing rates throughout the breeding
   season, and the contexts in which Tufted Titmice (Parus bicolor) were
   observed singing, suggest that male song may be used to establish and
   maintain territories, coordinate activities at the nest and with fledged
   young, and tutor fledged young. Male titmice also appeared to alter the
   characteristics of songs to enhance communication with conspecifics.
   Titmice uttered shorter songs at higher rates and sang with greater
   versatility when near conspecific males, possibly providing information
   about the probability of interacting. There were few correlation between
   particular song types and specific breeding stages or behavioral
   contexts. However, male titmice often matched song types when
   countersinging with neighboring males. By permitting changes in singing
   versatility and the matching of a neighbor's song type, song type
   repertories may enhance communication between conspecific males.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in paternal relative to maternal care either seasonally or ol-er
   the nest cycle may reflect conflicting reproductive strategies between
   the sexes or may enhance reproductive success in the presence of
   sex-specific, physiological constraints. To determine whether nest
   attendance by males relative to females changed seasonally or with stage
   of the nest cycle, 107 nests of the California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila
   californica) were monitored over the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons, and
   the sex of the attending adult was noted during each visit. Relative
   nest attendance by the male (RNRM) was calculated by dividing the
   frequency of the male observed on the nest by the number of times either
   adult was seen on the nest. Although variability in RNAM was high, RNAM
   showed a decline from approximately 0.5 for first nests of the season to
   approximately 0.3 for late-season nests. RNAM was less during the
   nestling stage than during incubation or laying. During the nestling
   period, RNAM was less than relative nest attendance by the female,
   whereas prior to hatching, attendance patterns did not differ between
   the sexes. Because the cause of RNAM variation is unknown, future
   studies should aim at determining the whereabouts of gnat-catchers while
   off the nest.}},

Abstract = {{Molt involves increased metabolic cost due to the energy required to
   synthesize new feathers and increased cost of thermoregulation because
   the insulation capacity is reduced. Flight cost is also increased
   because wing span and wing area are reduced when remiges are missing or
   growing. However, data on the reduction of wing area during molt
   (necessary for calculating aerodynamic performance) is lacking. I show
   how standard molt scores (converted into a raggedness score) can be used
   to estimate the reduction of wing area due to molt in Willow Warblers
   (Phylloscopus trochilus) and selected other passerines. Maximum wing
   area reduction associated with maximum raggedness score of the birds
   examined was approximately 10\%. Wing loading will therefore become
   increased during molt and flight performance will be reduced in similar
   ways as during migratory fattening.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified habitat use of nesting Lewis' Woodpeckers (Melanerpes
   lewis) in southeastern Wyoming on an 11,100-ha study area consisting of
   scattered ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. A 1295-ha burn in
   1974 and a 1590-ha burn in 1986 occurred prior to the study. Our results
   showed nest sites occurred in burned areas, which had more ground cover
   and downed logs. Birds were found in sites where visual obstruction of
   the sky including vegetation and burned branches was higher than non-use
   areas. Ninety-eight percent of nests were surrounded by burned ponderosa
   pine. We found 74\% of the nest trees on north- to east-facing slopes.
   Nests occurred in clumps rather than randomly throughout the habitat.
   Human disturbance did not appear to be a factor in nest placement and

Abstract = {{Greater Rheas (Rhea americana) lay unattended (orphan) eggs far from
   active nests. The objective of this study was to test the fertility of
   orphan eggs. Eggs were harvested and kept in storage for 1-7 d and then
   transported to incubation facilities. Fifteen (38\%) of 40 artificially
   incubated orphan eggs were fertile, and eight of them hatched. Orphan
   eggs found in mid-to late spring had higher fertility than those
   collected in summer. These results provide the first evidence for
   fertility of rhea orphan eggs. Systematic harvesting and artificial
   incubation of Greater Rhea orphan eggs could increase productivity of
   wild populations, using eggs which normally would have no chance of
   development and without disturbing the breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{The authors examined the legal, scientific, and philosophical
   underpinnings of the North American Bird Banding Program {[}BBP], with
   emphasis on the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory {[}BBL], but also
   considering the Canadian Bird Banding Office {[}BBO]. In this report, we
   review the value of banding data, enumerate and expand on the principles
   under which any modern BBP should operate, and from them derive our
   recommendations. These are cast into a Mission Statement, a Role and
   Function Statement, and a series of specific recommendations addressing
   five areas: (1) permitting procedures and practices; (2) operational
   issues; (3) data management; (4) BBL organization and staffing; and (5)
   implementation. Our major tenets and recommendations are as follows:
   banding provides valuable data for numerous scientific, management, and
   educational purposes, and its benefits far outweigh necessary biological
   and fiscal costs, especially those incurred by the BBL and BBO;
   because of the value of banding data for management of avian resources,
   including both game and nongame birds, government supper; of the program
   is fully justified and appropriate;
   all banding data, if collected to appropriate standards, are potentially
   valuable; there are many ways to increase the value of banding data such
   as by endorsing, promoting, and applying competence and/or training
   standards for permit issuance; promoting bander participation in
   well-designed projects; and by encouraging the use of banding data for
   meta-analytical approaches; the BBL should apply, promote, and encourage
   such standards, participation, and approaches;
   the BBP should be driven by the needs of users, including scientists and
   managers;
   all exchange of data and most communication between banders and the BBL
   should become electronic in the near future;
   the computer system at the BBL should be modernized to one designed for
   a true client-server relationship and storage of data in on-line
   relational databases;
   the BBL should continue to maintain high quality control and editing
   standards and should strive to bring all data in the database up to
   current standards; however, the BBL should transfer a major portion of
   the responsibility for editing banding data to the bander by providing
   software that will permit the bander to edit his/her own data
   electronically before submission to the BBL;
   the BBL should build the capacity to store additional data tied to
   original band records able to be pre-edited and submitted
   electronically, such as recapture data, appropriate data from auxiliary
   marking (e.g., resightings of color-marked birds), and other data that
   gain value when pooled from many banders (e.g., measurements); however,
   the BBL should only accept such data if they are collected using
   standardized methods and as part of an established program designed to
   utilize such data;
   now is the time to consider options for implementing a Western
   Hemisphere banding program, with leadership from the BBL;
   the Patuxent Electronic Data Processing Section should become part of
   the BBL;
   additional scientific and technical staff must be added to the BBL;
   an Implementation Team should be formed to expedite our recommendations,
   following timetables outlined in this document.}},

Abstract = {{To determine habitat preferences of peatland birds in a central Maine
   bog, spot-mapping was conducted in 1994 and 1995 on an 8-ha grid. Each
   0.25-ha unit of the grid was characterized by various measurements of
   tree density shrub density, and topographic relief. Multiple regression
   was used to identify habitat variables that best explained variation in
   bird occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the habitat selection of each
   species showed greater concordance within years at the two different
   scales than within scales in different years. The regression analysis
   was poor at predicting the abundance of Common Yellowthroats and Song
   Sparrows. Some of the regressions for Palm Warblers and White-throated
   Sparrows explained more than 70\% of the variance in bird abundance. The
   results suggest that these peatland birds see their habitat as
   fine-grained environments. Therefore, habitat selection during the
   nesting season is likely made on some general perception of habitat
   rather than specific habitat features.}},

Abstract = {{An automated video monitoring and surveillance system was developed that
   is capable of operation in hostile environmental conditions with a
   minimum of maintenance. Covert deployment, rapid installation, and a
   3-mo operating life without battery change are features of the system.
   It provides real-time continuous video filming of events of interest The
   power requirements and finite tape length dictated that it only film for
   short bursts, whenever an event of interest occurred. A reliable event
   detector using combinations of geophones and Passive InfraRed sensors is
   described. Such a video system has many applications in ornithological
   research and covert surveillance where it is not possible to have a
   person on site continuously. A number of problems have been overcome
   which are of general concern in such applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Virgin Islands Screech-Owl Otus nudipes newtoni is a little-studied
   taxon whose current status is uncertain. It historically occurred on
   several small islands immediately east of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.
   In an effort to assess its current status, I carried out surveys on St.
   John, St. Croix, and St. Thomas, the three largest of the United States
   Virgin Islands. Acoustic and visual surveys were carried out nightly for
   a 3-wk period during August 1995. Playback recordings of owl calls from
   the Puerto Rico subspecies did not elicit any responses during surveys,
   nor did I see any owls. I conclude that this taxon is extinct because
   the three sampled islands contained the largest remaining patches of
   appropriate habitat for this species.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{563-576}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Nest-site selection in the Purple Swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio) was
   quantified as a function of availability of food sources and predation
   risk. Purple Swamphens build several nests within their territories, one
   of which is selected for egg-laying. Nesting sites were mostly located
   near open areas (less concealed patches compared to non-nesting sites),
   where the main food source (cattail, Typha domingensis) grows earlier
   and better than in more covered areas. When selecting a nest for
   egg-laying, however, birds chose the most concealed of all nests built.
   Selection patterns were consistent in two consecutive seasons even when
   the distribution of suitable areas for breeding varied between seasons,
   and predation risk varied both between and within seasons. Only water
   depth, which varied both inter- and intraseasonally, seemed to be
   responsible for differences in predation risk. Thus, nests were
   significantly more depredated when water levels were low The results
   suggest that food sources are primarily considered earlier (when
   selecting a place for nest building) while habitat structure is
   primarily considered later (when selecting a nest for egg-laying). The
   explanation may be that availability of patches with suitable food
   sources is interseasonally predictable, while habitat structure may be
   affected by indirect changes in habitat variables within a given season.}},

Abstract = {{Project FeederWatch (PFW) is a North American-wide volunteer program
   that has compiled weekly observations of birds at feeders throughout
   each winter since 1987-1988. Three population indices are calculated for
   each bird species: percent of feeders visited, group size (number
   observed per visit), and mean abundance per feeder over the entire
   season. For nine resident species in the northeastern United States, we
   tested whether PFW indices reflect spatial and temporal patterns of
   abundance similar to those derived from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS).
   For most species, PFW indices were strongly correlated with BBS relative
   abundances from the same states (averaged across years). Percent of
   feeders visited was significantly correlated with BBS in all nine
   species, and mean abundance was significantly correlated in eight
   species, whereas average group size was correlated in only four species.
   However, there was poor correlation between PFW and BBS annual abundance
   indices (averaged across states). The range of temporal variation in PFW
   and BBS indices is more limited than the range of spatial variation
   across the northeast region, and PFW annual indices evidently do not
   track subtle population changes in the same manner as BBS. For two
   species (Carolina Wren, House Sparrow) that exhibited marked among-year
   changes in abundance, however, PFW tracked the same pattern of change as
   BBS, and annual indices from both programs were significantly
   correlated. We conclude from our analyses to date that winter feeder
   counts, if interpreted with care, accurately reflect spatial, and in
   some cases temporal, variation in abundance of common resident birds.}},

Abstract = {{Ovarian follicles of Eastern and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna
   and S. neglecta) and Hermit and Townsend's Warblers (Dendroica
   occidentalis and D. townsendi) grow and regress sufficiently rapidly for
   laying intervals to be distinguished. We describe how to deduce clutch
   size from counts of ovarian follicles and to estimate laying dates from
   curves describing the growth of preovulatory and regression of
   postovulatory follicles. Our estimates of clutch size for warblers and
   meadowlarks were not different from those published in the literature or
   obtained from museum records. For birds collected during or near laying,
   dates of egg laying could be estimated over a 5-6-day period for
   warblers and a 7-9-day period for meadowlarks. Our records increased the
   number of clutch initiation dates for Hermit Warblers by 54\%. The
   window of time during which clutch size can be deduced from ovarian
   follicles depends on: (1) how quickly follicles grow and regress, (2)
   how long postovulatory follicles can be identified, and (3) clutch size.
   This window of time is fairly narrow for both species because their
   follicles grow and regress quickly and because they lay relatively large
   clutches. Nonetheless, the clutch sizes we deduced from ovarian
   follicles for Hermit Warbler increased the number of records by 48\%. We
   encourage researchers and collectors to record ovarian follicle
   measurements for all female specimens, and recommend a standard format
   for recording follicle size measurements on museum labels.}},
