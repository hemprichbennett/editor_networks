Abstract = {{Recent surveys indicate the Madagascar Fish-Eagle Haliaectus
   vociferoides population is about 100 breeding pairs; the species is
   considered among the most endangered birds of prey worldwide. This paper
   reports one of several studies to determine the causes of the species'
   rarity so that an effective species survival plan can be implemented.
   Nesting and foraging habitat parameters including nest, nest tree,
   surrounding vegetation, and adjacent water parameters, were measured at
   56 nests found along the western seaboard of Madagascar. Descriptive
   statistics were used to look for consistent patterns among habitat
   parameters. While certain trends were apparent, such as always nesting
   within sight of water and in the largest trees, there was little
   evidence that would suggest negative human impact on nest site or
   foraging habitat availability for this species wherever large trees and
   water ecotones remain, yet many such sites are unoccupied. Conservation
   of water-forest ecotones in western Madagascar is a high priority for
   the survival of this species, but wider conservation measures are needed
   to address direct human interference and additional study is needed to
   fully understand habitat limitation and other possible causes of the
   species' rarity.}},

Abstract = {{DDT has, since 1946 been used in the intradomicilliary control of
   malaria in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The Pied Kingfisher was selected as
   representative for organisms in relatively high trophic levels. Blood
   was obtained from Pied Kingfishers at Kosi Bay (n = 5), Pongolo
   Floodplain (n = 13), Mkuzi Nature Reserve (n = 4), Ndumu Nature Reserve
   (n = 4) and St Lucia (n = 3), extracted and analysed {[}SWE1] via gas
   chromatography. The highest blood DDE and Sigma DDT concentrations were
   obtained for the birds from the Pongolo Floodplain (means of 95.92 mu g
   l(-1)/107.01 mu g l(-1)) and Kosi Bay Nature Reserve (means of 189.09 mu
   g l(-1/)241.8 mu g l(-1)). DDT was detected in the blood of Pied
   Kingfishers from Kosi Bay (mean 47.14 mu g l(-1)) and Pongolo Floodplain
   (mean 44.34 mu g l(-1)) only. This indicated their proximity to DDT
   application and the greater influx of DDT and its metabolites into the
   water component of these systems. The Sigma DDT plasma concentrations in
   the Pied Kingfisher blood were calculated by multiplying the blood
   values of Sigma DDT by 1.8. Using the regression, log(10)Y = 0.7785 +
   0.8593 (log(10)X), relating the Sigma DDT in eggs to Sigma DDT in plasma
   of American Kestrel Falco sparverius it was possible to calculate the
   mean Pied Kingfisher egg Sigma DDT concentration. The approximate mean
   Pied Kingfisher egg concentration of Sigma DDT was calculated at 2.26 mg
   kg(-1) for Kosi Bay and 1.24 mg kg(-1) for the Pongolo Floodplain. Using
   the highest calculated plasma value of Sigma DDT for Kosi Bay and the
   Pongolo Floodplain indicated that egg Sigma DDT concentrations could be
   as high as 4.01 mg kg(-1) and 4.17 mg kg(-1) respectively. These
   calculated levels may be significant when compared to levels of DDE,
   known to have a detrimental effect, in the eggs of the Brown Pelican
   Pelecanus occidentalis, where a concentration of 2.5 to 3 mg kg(-1) was
   associated with substantially impaired reproductive success. The highest
   calculated egg concentration was nearing this level and it is therefore
   possible that the Pied Kingfisher population may be at risk.}},

Abstract = {{Prince Ruspoli's Turaco is an Ethiopian endemic, distributed in a small
   region at the southern border of the Abyssinian Plateau. Owing to the
   difficulty of visiting its secluded range, little informations available
   on its current conservation status. Based on the available data, it is
   currently considered endangered in the IUCN criteria. In order to
   evaluate the conservation status of T. ruspolii, field work was carried
   out during spring 1995. The results of the survey were as follows:
   1. the species was found in 26 localities, including all of those
   previously reported by other authors, and had an area of occurrence
   about 6 500 km(2)
   2. the population of T. ruspolii was censused by means of linear
   transects, giving an estimate of about 10 000 individuals.
   3. T. ruspolii frequents mostly forest margins and relatively dry Acaria
   woodlands. These habitats are less severely threatened by human activity
   than true forests in present day Ethiopia.
   4. since T. ruspolii and the related T. leucotis usually occur in
   different habitats (the latter preferring wetter forest) competition is
   not likely to be a severe threat for T. ruspolii.
   5. the species is subject to some egg collecting by local people, but
   probably not to a severe extent. Other direct human persecution was not
   recorded.
   6. although there is no hint of numerical decrease in the past, this is
   likely to occur in the future, as consequence of the increasing human
   pressure in the region.
   These results are evaluated and discussed. It is consequently proposed
   that Prince Ruspolii's Turaco should be considered as a Vulnerable
   species instead of Endangered in the IUCN criteria.}},

Abstract = {{All Levaillant's Cisticolas south of the Limpopo River art currently
   considered to be of the nominate race. Atlas data indicate a distinct
   discontinuity in the distribution, separating birds in the winter
   rainfall region of the Western Cape from those in the summer rainfall
   zone of South Africa. Western Cape birds breed and moult earlier. are
   smaller in wing and tail length, but heavier in weight, and lack the
   distinctive summer plumage of a pale rufous. unstreaked crown in
   nominate tinniens. Both taxa undergo a partial body moult in spring, but
   in Western Cape birds this is not a pre- but a peri-breeding, moult
   during which they develop a new nonbreeding plumage. Evidence for early
   territorial settlement and pairing in juvenile plumage, which is similar
   to the nonbreeding plumage. was obtained. indicating that the summer
   plumage may not be a key factor in species recognition. Western Cape
   birds are described as, a new subspecies brookei. A sample of museum
   specimens contained too many apparently incorrectly sexed birds to
   reveal sexual bimodality in biometry, and they indicated differences in
   biometry between taxa in the opposite direction of that found in larger
   samples of live birds.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the Scimitarbilled Woodhoopoe Rhinopomastus
   cyanomelas was studied at two sites in Zimbabwe over a 13-year period
   from 1964-1977. The pairs were resident, remained together throughout
   the year, and inspected their nest sites occasionally during the
   non-breeding season. The breeding season extended from August to
   December with a marked September/October peak. Eggs were laid at daily
   intervals. Clutch size averaged 2.9 (range 2-4). Incubation began either
   with the penultimate or last laid egg. During the 13-14 day incubation
   period the female left the nest only occasionally each day and was
   reliant on the male for food. This pattern continued for four days after
   the chicks hatch. Thereafter she started to forage and gradually
   increased her contribution to chick provisioning until she overtook that
   of the male. With one exception, he never fed the chicks directly and
   delivered the food to the female. The nestlings were brooded overnight
   for the first two weeks. The anti-predator response of the young
   included a malodorous brown exudation from the preen gland and
   unpleasant liquid excreta. The nestling period was 21-24 days and the
   young left the vicinity of the nest with their parents and did not
   return to roost in it. Twelve breeding cycles were monitored and 76\% of
   eggs laid (n=37) produced fledged young. Second broods were raised in
   the same nest on two, occasions after successful rearing of the first,
   presumably by the same pair, but the birds were not individually marked.
   There was no evidence of helpers at the nest.}},

Abstract = {{The proximate purpose of the study was to investigate the possibility
   that micromammalian remains from archaeological sites could provide
   quantified data concerning past climates. Proportions of micromammalian
   taxa represented in Barn Owl pellets recovered from 111 roost sites in
   Africa south of 22 degrees S were analysed with climate variables to
   determine whether there was any relationship between the two.
   Preliminary results indicate that some taxa, notably the gerbils
   Gerbillinae and Gerbillurus and mice Mastomys, will be capable of
   providing such data, it is clear, however, that careful attention must
   be paid to the compilation of the database and the nature of the
   evidence bring employed. The disturbed nature of much vegetation in the
   region must be taken into consideration but it is probable that the
   effects of disturbance can be characterised and therefore discounted.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 393 seabirds from nine species killed by longline fishing in
   South African waters around the Prince Edward Islands during summer
   1996-97 were sexed, measured, and their body fat levels and primary
   moults scored. Males of Whitechinned Petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis
   and Greyheaded and (Indian Ocean) Yellownosed Mollymawks Thalassarche
   chrysostoma and T. {[}chlororhynchos] bassi averaged 1-9\% larger than
   females. Measures of bill depth were the most dimorphic characters in
   all three species. I recommend that if only a single measure is taken to
   estimate sex of adults, bill depth at the base be the standard measure
   for petrels, and bill depth at the nail be the standard measure for
   mollymawks. Discriminant functions are described for predicting the sex
   of unknown individuals; the proportion of misclassified birds ranged
   from 2-10\%. With the exception of giant petrels Macronectes spp., only
   two young birds were actively moulting their primary flight feathers.
   Analysis of wear patterns among adult Greyheaded Mollymawk primaries
   conforms with studies of moult in this species at South Georgia. Fat
   scores did not differ between sexes. They tended to decrease during the
   breeding season, but trends were masked by great inter-individual
   variation. There was no significant relationship between fat scores and
   the presence of ingested plastics. Plastic debris was found in the
   stomachs of 90 birds from five species. Incidence in Whitechinned Petrel
   stomachs (37\%) was less than that reported from birds collected off
   South Africa in the early 1980s (57\%), but this is probably due to the
   predominance of breeding adults. The frequency and size of plastic loads
   decreased through the breeding season, which is consistent with the
   hypothesis that inter-generational transfer is important in the dynamics
   of ingested debris.}},

   Cape Turtle Doves comprised about two-thirds of the catch. On a dairy

Abstract = {{In the late 1970s there were about 180 breeding pairs of Cape Vulture
   Gyps coprotheres at Colleywobbles colony. In the 1980s the colony
   increased to over 300 pairs, presumably as a result of birds immigrating
   to the Transkei. In the 1990s the colony declined to about 60 pairs,
   either through emigration or mortality. The decrease from the 1980s to
   the 1990s was probably related to a reduction in food supply (carcasses
   of domestic livestock) as a result or changes in human social
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{Passive anting has been recorded from four non-passerine species in
   Africa, the Rock Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, the African Finfoot Podica
   senegalensis, the African Hoopoe Upupa epops and the Whitebacked
   Mousebird Colius colius. Active or passive anting has been recorded from
   21 passerine species in 10 families in the wild, and in captive birds in
   a further 27 species of 3 families. Although such behaviour may have
   been overlooked or misinterpreted, the rarity of observations implies
   that in most species anting is likely to be infrequent. In all cases in
   which the ants have been identified, they were: members of the
   sub-family Formicinae. It appears unlikely that any single functional
   explanation can account for the observed occurrences of this behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The territorial song of the Blackeyed Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus is
   described for a population followed over two breeding seasons in
   suburban Grahamstown, South Africa. The Blackeyed Bulbul has a discrete
   and highly structured system of phrase sharing by neighbourhood groups
   of males. The most common repertoire size is five phrases (mean 5.5;
   range 2-9). In a temporally-stable song population, individual phrases
   are shared independently by discrete clusters of males. Neighbours show
   a strong tendency to share phrase types (but rarely whole repertoires),
   with overall song similarity decreasing rapidly with increasing distance
   between birds. This species is an ideal candidate Tol testing hypotheses
   concerning the adaptive value of song sharing by neighbourhood groups.}},

Abstract = {{A local population of Yellowthroated Sandgrouse was monitored from
   1988-1992 at Northam, Northern Province, South Africa, a region in which
   this species was previously an irruptive. non-breeding visitor.
   Yellowthroated Sandgrouse were found to be veer-round residents,
   foraging and nesting exclusively in areas cleared for agriculture,
   particularly one-year fallow lands. They ate the dry seeds of a variety
   of weedy plants. especially. Amaranthus and Crotalaria spp.. Males
   outnumbered females 1.35:1. Egg-laying occurred from April October. with
   a peak in June. Clutch size (2-3) averaged 2.85 (n=26), and the
   incubation period for one nest was 26 days after clutch completion.
   Nesting success was estimated at 24.8\% (n=19 nests. 176 nest days), and
   the daily nest predation rate at 2.55\%: predation and ploughing
   accounted Tur most nest losses. Average annual productivity was
   estimated to be within the range 0.42-0.85 young/pair/year. We suggest
   that the Yellowthroated Sandgrouse depends on the sleds of early
   successional plants for food and that the recent agricultural
   development of the region maintains sufficient areas of fallow land to
   allow this otherwise nomadic species to become a breeding resident.}},

Abstract = {{I trapped. marked, sexed and examined moult and softparts on 101
   free-living Greater Kestrels Falco rupicoloides near Pretoria, South
   Africa, during 1975-1988. I collected and plucked one kestrel to
   determine the number and mass of its feather tracts, as an index of
   materials invested in moult. I also examined moult on 72 museum
   specimens from southern Africa and observed plumage and softpart changes
   in four captive birds. During 1975-1979, I made focal observations on
   free-living adult kestrels (males 181 h, females 262 h) and recorded
   monthly samples of their visual communication behaviours to the nearest
   minute.
   Greater Kestrels can be aged for three successive plumage and softpart.
   stages (juvenile, post-juvenile, adult). Plumage changes with potential
   signal effects involved only small investments at the post-juvenile and
   first adult moults (3.7\% and 11\% of total plumage mass respectively).
   Changes in colouration and communication behaviour correlated with
   relevant stages of the annual cycle, possibly to miminze conflict with
   territorial adults and age of first breeding. Remex and rectrix moult
   starts on average much later in relation to egglaying for Greater and
   some tropical kestrels than for some temperate species. This and other
   individual variation in timing may result for variations in nutritional
   status.}},

   1994/95 breeding season. Mean incubation temperature was 34.4 +/- 0.7
   degrees C (range: 32.2-37.0; n=3). The average maximum temperature
   attained by exposed dummy eggs, averaged higher at 37.4 +/- 2.7 degrees
   C (n=5). The absolute maximum recorded for exposed eggs was 40.1 degrees
   C. These temperatures are within lethal limits measured for other birds
   and suggests that heating of exposed eggs after disturbance of
   incubating was not a direct factor in explaining variation in breeding
   success of oystercatchers in the Alexandria Dunefield, Algoa Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly fledged Gory's Shearwater Calonectris diomedea chicks at Selvagem
   Grande occasionally desert their nest sites during the night, but
   generally return before dawn. The temporary use of other nest sites is
   rare and lasts less than two days. Almost all chicks from Selvagem
   Grande return to the island for their first breeding attempt; very few
   breed at islands outside the archipelago. On Selvagem Grande, almost
   half the males return to their native colony whereas more than 90\% of
   females recruit to other colonies. Inter-colony movements sometimes
   exceed 1 km, but, if they return to their native colony, both sexes
   settle within 20 m of their natal site. From the second breeding attempt
   onwards, most birds of both sexes are faithful to the nest site. On
   average, less than 20\% of birds desert their former nest site each
   year, with a shift of about 4 m only. Most nest shifts follow a breeding
   failure or a temporary respite from breeding, and are accompanied by a
   switch in partners.}},

Abstract = {{Madagascar Fish Eagles Haliaeetus vociferoides laid eggs over a 53-day
   period from the end of May to mid-July. The incubation period ranged
   from 37 to 43 days with a mean of 39.7 days and 95\% confidence interval
   of +/- 2.3 days. Eggs hatched over a 46-day period from 5 July to 20
   August with a mean hatch date of 23 July, and a 95\% confidence interval
   of 18 to 28 July. Nestling periods ranged from 78 to 89 days and
   averaged 82 days. Mean fledging date was calculated from mean hatching
   date as 9 to 20 September, with a 95\% confidence interval from 31
   August to 29 September. Clutch size was determined in 35 cases, of which
   seven (20\%) were single-egg and 28 were two-egg clutches. Productivity
   from occupied territories was 0.15 fledged young/territory in 65
   pair-years. Sibling rescue in three years increased productivity to 0.28
   young/territory. Apart from failure to lay eggs, which accounted for 21
   of the 55 instances, siblicide accounted for most of the reduced
   productivity. Human removal of nestlings for food and to keep in
   captivity accounted for a large proportion of the total breeding
   failures.
   The most unusual behaviour observed was the presence of an extra-pair
   bird in the immediate proximity of a breeding pair in 40 (42\%) of 95
   pair-years, at 41 nest sites (the status of every pair was not
   determined every year). Extra-pair birds participated briefly in
   incubation and nestling-period activities in each of two observed nests.
   Banding evidence suggests that extra-pair birds are progeny from
   previous years that have delayed dispersal, but sample size is too small
   to be conclusive.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 229 Lesser Kestrels Falco naumannt shot by airport personnel
   as part of their bird control programme, was obtained from the
   Bloemfontein and Kimberley airports during the 1984/85, 1985/86 and
   1986/87 austral summers Analysis of stomach contents of non-breeding
   individuals visiting South Africa's Free State and Northern Cape
   Provinces indicated that Arthropoda comprise 90\% of the diet, with
   Solifugae (30\%), Orthoptera (23\%), Chilopoda (20\%) and Isoptera
   (10\%) being the most important food items. Vertebrates were virtually
   absent from the diet. No sex-related dietary differences were found.
   Lesser Kestrels are opportunistic invertebrate feeders which mainly
   utilise available and most abundant prey species. Female birds are
   significantly heavier than males; but the latter maintain higher body
   fat reserves for the larger part bf their stay in South Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The Redbellied and Bates's Paradise Flycatchers Terpsiphone rufiventer
   and T. batesi are widely distributed in the rain forests of the
   Guineo-Congolian Region. They have similar ecological requirements,
   usually identical songs and in Gabon, Congo and parts of Cameroon at
   least appear to be mainly allopatric. However, the two species meet in
   the forest/savanna mosaic of NW Congo (Odzala) where T. rufiventer
   inhabits only swamp forest and T. batesi both swamp and closed-canopy
   dryland forest. Eight of 23 birds (35\%) occupying territories in swamp
   forest were found to be hybrids. Territories are defended against
   congeners as well as conspecifics. In dryland forest, however, some ir:
   batesi have developed a very different song-type which is not understood
   by birds from swamp forest. It is possible that I batesi came into
   contact with T. rufiventer at Odzala through the current expansion of
   the dryland forest. One of the hybrid males sang like African Paradise
   Flycatcher T. viridis, occupied a territory at the edge of swamp forest
   (a situation more typical of T. viridis) and may have been a multiple
   hybrid.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of 24 pairs of Southern African Kestrels Falco
   tinnunculus rupicolus was studied over two seasons in the Tarkastad
   District (32 degrees S), South Africa, and compared to studies of the
   western European Kestrel Falco tinnunculus tinnunculus (53 degrees N).
   Most Southern African Kestrels bred in old stick nests and on cliffs at
   densities comparable with average densities of European Kestrels (24.3
   pairs. 100 km(-2) vs. 12-32 pairs. 100 km(-2)). Mean clutch size was
   smaller than found in Europe (3.21 eggs vs. 4.4 eggs) while incubation
   period at one nest was 26 days and within the range of the European
   Kestrel (26-31 days). Nestling (30-31 days) and post-fledging periods
   (32-39 days) were also similar to the range recorded for the European
   Kestrel (27-35 days and 13-31 days respectively). The number of chicks
   fledged was inversely related to laying date, as in Europe. Provisioning
   rates to nestlings were higher than in Europe (57.4 items.nest(-1) vs.
   13-19.2 items.nest(-1)), but the estimated size and amount of food
   delivered to the nest per day was lower (151.8 g.nest(-1) vs. 325
   g.nest(-1)). Chick growth rates were within the range measured for
   European Kestrel chicks (Ricklef's growth rate constant K = 0.257 vs. K
   = 0.166-0.312) but wing feather-growth rate was marginally lower. Only
   clutch size fitted predictions of life-history theory over latitudinal
   gradients although more data is needed on other life-history parameters.
   I suggest that environmental variation resulting in differences in food
   availability and food quality are responsible for latitudinal trends in
   life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need for rapid habitat evaluations, in the
   tropics, for conservation purposes. Biodiversity is often assessed by
   studying relatively well known groups, such as birds. But even birds can
   be difficult to watch and identify in tropical habitats. Mist-netting is
   relatively free of observer bias, and allows sampling effort to be
   standardised. We sampled birds by mist-netting in seven wooded habitats,
   covering a wide range of levels of anthropogenic disturbance, in the
   Cufada region, Guinea Bissau. Capture rates, species diversity (as
   estimated by rarefaction) and originality of the bird communities
   appeared to be higher in disturbed habitats. Primary forest had the
   lowest capture rate and the lowest diversity index. Originality was also
   very low in primary forest. We discuss several possible causes for these
   patterns and argue that surveys based exclusively on mist-netting can be
   severely misleading, when comparing bird communities in different
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In the arid areas of southern Africa, the drowning of raptors in small
   reservoirs on farms is a significant cause of mortality. Records of 322
   raptors of 29 species which drowned during 163 separate incidents have
   been collated. Whitebacked Gyps africanus and Cape Vultures Gyps
   coprotheres, and Martial Polemaetus bellicosus and Black Eagles Aquila
   verreauxii, were the species most frequently recovered from reservoirs.
   There are few records of small raptors (<300 g) succumbing in this
   manner. There are several possible explanations as to why raptors drown.
   The simplest is that these birds enter the reservoir to drink or bathe
   and if it is not full are then unable to climb up the structure's steep
   sides. There have been 12 recorded vulture mass drowning events,
   involving as many as 38 birds at one time. The reason for these mass
   drownings is probably different to the individual drowning of other
   raptors, with the ``intimate lifestyle{''} hypothesis being the most
   plausible. There are simple, cheap and effective solutions to prevent
   the drowning of raptors and these are being advocated with success in
   the Northern Cape Province, South Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of wetland birds to rapidly find and exploit ephemeral pans
   is well known in arid lands, but the episodic nature of such events
   means that the methods employed are poorly understood. Birds may: (i)
   wander randomly until wetlands are found; (ii) predict rainfronts and
   rainfall using changes in pressure gradients as cues; or (iii) follow
   rainfronts directly and descend onto pans as they fill. Observations
   from isolated pans in Namibia during the first rains indicate that
   wetland birds follow rainfronts, and descend onto pans as they fill: In
   one 30 ha pan, 37 birds of 5 species had arrived one day after filling
   and in another 50 ha pan over 300 birds of 13 species were attracted
   within 3 days of filling. Wetland birds, like migratory raptors,
   therefore, follow rainfronts, and may wander locally thereafter. How
   species such as grebes and flamingos that exploit these pans for later
   breeding and intercontinental movements (respectively) time their
   flights to coincide with fully flooded pans remains unknown.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Theories about the evolution of migratory behaviour in birds have
   recently been grouped in eight categories (Rappole 1995). Common to all
   of them is the idea that migration originated in ancestral sedentary
   populations by some kind of `behavioural jump'. These are difficult to
   explain, especially under the assumption that migration has evolved
   several or many times independently. Recent experimental studies
   undertaken to illuminate the genetics of bird migration and the
   potential and speed of the associated microevolutionary processes have
   led to another view - a simple yet comprehensive theory. Its central
   concept is (obligate) partial migration, which is extremely widespread
   at higher latitudes, possibly also in the tropics, and seems to have
   evolved very early or might even have been inherited from pre-avian
   ancestors. Partial migration provides a behavioural turntable from which
   exclusive migratoriness and sedentariness can easily and rapidly be
   reached (or left) through selection and related microevolutionary
   processes. The fact that all important migratory features are directly
   genetically controlled, that migratoriness and amount of migratory
   activity are based on a common genetic mechanism, and that migratory
   syndromes exist, probably all greatly facilitate microevolutionary
   changes from migratoriness to sedentariness and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{As northern climates changed towards those existing at present, bird
   taxa kept evolving forms adapted to the variety of high-latitude
   habitats - inland, coastal and alpine. These habitats are structurally
   simple and dominated by dramatic seasonality and permafrost. These
   adaptations are expressed in several seasonal and regional avifaunas
   which include the 20-25 resident bird species of the Siberian taiga, and
   some 15-45 typical summer visitors to hypoarctic, subalpine and tundra
   habitats. The survival strategies of birds in these extreme habitats are
   discussed in the light of experimental data and observations gathered
   during the seemingly most stressful periods of the birds' annual life
   cycle, namely mid-winter in north-eastern Asia and incubation on
   permafrost in upland tundra. Of the subarctic residents, only grouse
   utilise predictable browse foods, but have to cope with its low energy
   content. Winter survival in other taxa depends on utilising fall
   harvests and individual energy stores. In all cases, the energy
   utilisation in wintering birds appears to be minimised. In summer,
   non-resident birds treat their local resources in quite a different way
   with no evidence of direct energy limitation on reproduction, including
   incubation. There is little evidence of individual cost-minimisation
   strategies. Instead, local population-resource balances are regulated
   through a variety of social mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers are the first example of adaptive evolution by Natural
   Selection mentioned by Darwin who commented that their `feet, tail, beak
   and tongue' are `so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of
   trees'. Over the ensuing decades, the adaptiveness and evolution of
   these diverse woodpecker features has been examined by many workers but
   with limited success. A major problem was that these evolutionary
   explanations were not supported by logically prior functional
   explanations. Structures of the toes, hind limb and tail are associated
   with climbing. All forces acting on the climbing bird can be determined
   with the Method of Free-Body Analysis, which together with measurements
   of hind limb and tail features and of the tree surfaces used by
   different species, will permit understanding of the evolution of
   climbing adaptations. Bill shape and M. protractor pterygoidei
   development correlate with forces on the bill during drilling. Again
   Free-Body Analysis shows that compressive shocks acting on the bill do
   not travel directly into the brain case and hence the brain, but result
   in a compressive stress in the base of the skull. The frontal overhang
   in specialised drilling woodpeckers provides a bony stop that prevents
   excessive abduction of the upper jaw during non-impact periods while
   drilling into trees. Specialisations of the tongue are connected with
   greater protraction of the tongue to obtain food. These features not
   only include longer protractor and retractor muscles, but a universal
   joint between the basihyal and the fused paraglossalia and the
   enlargement of two pairs of intrinsic muscles inserting on the
   paraglossalia enabling movement of the tip of the corneous tongue in all
   directions. With a better understanding of the adaptiveness and
   evolution of these diverse features of woodpeckers, it is possible to
   obtain an improved comprehension of their ecological associations,
   adaptations and evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{I report here on novel endocrinological methods originally developed for
   the artificial breeding of the Japanese Crested Ibis, Nipponia nippon.
   According to the most recent information, the only wild population in
   the world is one of about 60 individuals in Yang Xian, China. Captive
   populations of 54 and 17 individuals are located in Yang Xian and at
   Beijing Zoo, respectively and a single female of this species survives
   in Japan. Females of many birds stop breeding when they are brought to
   captivity. Hormone administration is considered to be effective in
   stimulating the breeding activity of such females. If the ovary of a
   captive female contains well-developed ova but does not ovulate, the
   problem is not serious. Ovulation can be induced by injection of
   gonadotropic hormone. However, if the ovary is regressed and contains no
   developed ova, the problem is serious. Until recently, no avian
   endocrinologist had been able to induce ovulation in hens with a
   regressed ovary. We developed a non-invasive method to assess the
   ovarian and testicular condition of birds by analysing gonadal sex
   steroid hormones in droppings. By using this method, we can decide
   whether the ovary contains developed ova or not and whether a male is
   sexually active or not. To reactivate a regressed ovary, we employed
   gonadotropin administration by means of the osmotic pump implantation in
   female Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica kept under short-days and then
   injected with the gonadotropin preparation once a day for several days.
   About 50\% of the females laid an egg or eggs in response to the
   injection. Seven of the eggs were artificially incubated and two of them
   hatched. One of the two was revealed to be a male and fertile. The
   faecal sex steroid assays have been successfully applied to males of the
   Japanese Crested Ibis and Kakapo Strigops habroptilus in New Zealand.
   Although too late to apply the hormone administration method to the
   Japanese Crested Ibis for breeding, application of the method to the
   Kakapo is now being examined in New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{Great Tits Parus major and Blue Tits Parus caeruleus compete for food
   and for cavities. By providing nest boxes with entrance holes small
   enough to exclude Great Tits, but allowing access to Blue Tits, either
   by themselves or in combination with standard nest boxes we manipulated
   the breeding densities of Blue and Great Tits independently. We compared
   populations differing in experimental densities over five-year periods.
   Components of Blue Tit reproductive success are adversely affected when
   either Blue Tit or Great Tit densities are experimentally increased. At
   high Blue Tit density adult survival does not change. When small-holed
   nest boxes are provided and Blue Tit density is increased, the number of
   local born males that recruit into the population increases
   considerably, so that the proportion of local born males is much higher
   than at low density. Similarly the local recruitment rate (the number of
   local recruits per adult breeding in the previous year) increases
   strongly for males, but not for females. The presence of small-holed
   nest boxes increases habitat quality, especially in winter when Blue
   Tits use these boxes for roosting, so that juveniles disperse less, and
   breeding density increases.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of taxonomic differentiation and geographical distribution of
   West Indian birds suggest that taxa may pass through phases of
   increasing and decreasing geographical range. Such sequences are
   referred to as taxon cycles. Although decline may often lead to
   extinction, new phases of expansion, accompanied by increased or shifted
   habitat distribution are also possible. The taxon cycle is a historical
   hypothesis, but its existence was formerly inferred from contemporary,
   indirect evidence. Molecular studies of land birds in the West Indies
   now provide relative ages for taxa based on genetic differentiation
   among island populations. These age estimates confirm that older
   populations tend to have restricted geographical and ecological
   distributions. That ecology and geography are strongly correlated with
   age across taxa also suggests that the time course for evolutionary
   change through the taxon cycle is relatively consistent among
   independently evolving populations. Because young taxa have continuous
   distributions within the West Indies, gaps in the ranges of older taxa
   indicate extinctions of island populations. Starting from this premise,
   one may estimate exponential extinction rates of about 50\% per million
   years for island populations in the Lesser Antilles, which indicates an
   average population life span of two million years. The relative timing
   of expansion phases suggests that cyclic dynamics of populations are not
   driven by extrinsic factors such as climate and associated habitat
   change during glacial cycles. Alternatively, such cycles may be
   intrinsic, perhaps driven by lags in the evolutionary responses of host
   and parasite populations. This is suggested by observed variation in the
   prevalence of blood parasites among island populations of the same
   species. The taxon cycle concept provides a useful paradigm for
   understanding variation among species in geographical range, ecological
   distribution, and vulnerability to extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Avian demography is defined here as the study of the statistics of bird
   populations. Ornithology has generated types of data - or been the first
   discipline to generate them - which do not lend themselves to standard
   statistical analyses. In these situations, the role of the avian
   demographer is to develop custom-built statistical methods - the
   analysis of primary moult is an example of a type of data needing
   specialised methods and this is discussed in the final sections of the
   paper. Data from the Southern African Bird Atlas Project is used to
   present some insights into the biogeography of southern African birds,
   and to describe the `texture' of bird distributions. The year 1998
   marks, approximately, the centenary of the introduction of the European
   Starling Sturnus vulgaris to Cape Town and the House Sparrow Passer
   domesticus to Durban, and the paper notes this event and these species.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments show co-evolution between the Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus
   and its hosts. Both egg mimicry and laying behaviour of cuckoos have
   evolved in relation to host defences. In turn, host egg rejection and
   aggression to cuckoos have evolved in response to parasitism. Selective
   egg replacement by cuckoos may also lead to egg mimicry but current
   evidence for this is weak. Hosts incur costs of rejection, so below a
   critical parasitism frequency they do better to accept. This is
   reflected in phenotypic flexibility in host defences in relation to
   small-scale geographical variation and temporal changes in parasitism
   rate. The puzzle is why so many hosts accept non-mimetic eggs. There are
   more acceptors among cowbird hosts in North and South America than among
   cuckoo hosts in Europe or southern Africa, and cowbird hosts show less
   intermediate rejection frequencies. One hypothesis is that acceptor
   hosts would do better to reject and accept because they are at the start
   of the co-evolutionary cycle. In support of this: host-parasite systems
   show dynamic changes, calculations suggest that many hosts would indeed
   do better to reject, and old cowbird hosts are stronger rejectors than
   are new hosts. An alternative hypothesis is that host acceptance can be
   an equilibrium. In support of this: rejection costs for some hosts are
   sufficiently high for acceptance to be best, in Australia a long
   breeding season reduces parasitism costs and may explain acceptance
   there, and Mafia cuckoos may enforce acceptance. Variation in host
   acceptance is likely to reflect a mixture of systems at equilibrium and
   those showing evolutionary lag. Host responses to parasite chicks are
   discussed, particularly how the parasite chicks manipulate hosts through
   begging signals.}},

   inform and advise environmental decision-makers. Ornithologists have a
   special contribution to make because of the extent and quality of the
   information available to us. This paper focuses on environmental
   indicators - the process by which complex information about the
   environment can be encapsulated in some simply understood measures. This
   paper reviews the properties of effective indicators and the
   contribution that ornithology can currently make. Attention is given to
   globally threatened species, common bird monitoring schemes, summarising
   trend data from many species and to spatial questions about the

Abstract = {{To reconstruct the spatio-temporal development of life on earth
   biogeographers have traditionally used several units of analysis and
   various kinds of data. The species has long been a fundamental unit, and
   a map of a species' distribution a basic datum. Some recent workers
   reject the biological species concept and advocate a phylogenetic one
   instead. Just as the definition of species may be changing, new
   technology and new mapping techniques are enlarging the concept of map.
   Through area cladograms, cladistics has modified the way taxonomic and
   area relationships are considered. Biogeography at the end of the 20th
   century thus is a conglomerate of old and new concepts, and of classic
   and revised interpretations. However, a literature review shows that,
   whether they use older trends or newer approaches, and irrespective of
   the school of thought they adhere to, biogeographers try to answer three
   hierarchically interrelated questions: (1) What are the patterns of
   geographical distribution? (2) What processes explain these patterns?
   and (3) How are these processes controlled? Pattern recognition is
   indispensable for any further work, process identification is concerned
   with proximate explanation, and process control seeks ultimate causation
   and may lead to theoretical considerations.}},

Abstract = {{The density of landbird species within different habitats, and presence
   within 4 ha squares, on Silhouette Island were recorded in August 1996,
   repeating a previous survey (January 1979). Densities of the four most
   common species were calculated from point counts: Seychelles Sunbirds
   occurred at 2-5 birds/ha, Seychelles Bulbuls 0.50-4 birds/ha, Indian
   Mynahs 0.2-2 birds/ha and Seychelles Blue Pigeons 0.3 birds/ha depending
   on habitat. Population estimates were: Seychelles Sunbirds 5600,
   Seychelles Bulbuls 4000, Indian Mynahs 1100, Seychelles Blue Pigeons
   600, and Seychelles Kestrel, approximately 15 pairs. The distributions
   of nonendemic Indian Mynahs, Barred Ground Doves and Madagascar Fodies
   were smaller in 1996 compared to 1979, while those of endemic Seychelles
   Bulbuls and Sunbirds were larger. Mynahs were more likely to occur in
   squares containing human activity, but habitat variables rather than
   human effects predicted the presence or absence of endemics. Mynahs were
   more likely to occur in a square, controlling for habitat variables, if
   Bulbuls were absent, and vice versa. There may be major seasonal changes
   in the relative distribution of introduced and endemic species.
   Alternatively, introduced species may have actually declined, probably
   because of a decrease in human population between the two surveys;
   endemics may then have increased because of reduced competition.}},

Abstract = {{The Mauritius Fody Foudia rubra, a highly endangered species of weaver
   (Ploceidae) endemic to Mauritius, was studied from 1989-1993. The
   plumage, various display postures (typical of the family), and seven
   adult and two juvenile vocalisations are described. The diet consisted
   of insects, nectar and fruit, Males were in breeding plumage, and
   breeding took place, between late August and early April, although
   severe weather in February 1992 terminated breeding activity early. The
   species appeared to be monogamous and was suspected to maintain a
   long-term pair bond. Pairs occupied exclusive territories of not less
   than 0.9 ha. Both sexes built the nest from the outset, but only the
   female lined it. Between breeding attempts, some pairs habitually
   started but then abandoned one or more nests. Clutch sizes of two to
   four were recorded, three being the norm. Incubation and brooding were
   carried out by the female; the male joined in feeding the young after
   daytime brooding ceased. Juvenile dependency appeared to last around two
   weeks after which the young were ousted from the territory. The
   potential productivity of up to three broods per pair per year was not
   achieved by any pair studied because of poor nesting success. A complete
   moult followed breeding. Territorial defence continued throughout the
   year, and no evidence for seasonal movements was seen. Two behavioural
   features seem unexpected: 1) male nest invitation and nest advertisement
   behaviour appeared to be absent; 2) females participated from the outset
   of nest-building (including prospecting). These could be explained by
   the existence of a long-term pair bond, which needs to be confirmed but
   would not; be surprising in a species that remains on territory all
   year. Hypotheses that could be tested to find a mechanism responsible
   for the unusual features of the fody are suggested. In comparison with
   other fodies studied, the breeding behaviour most resembled that of the
   Seychelles Fody F. sechellarum (also a monogamous, nongraminivorous
   omnivore that breeds in solitary pairs in evergreen forest). The annual
   cycle was similar to that of other native passerines and most other fody
   taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The forests at the shores of Lake Victoria had considerable attention
   from researchers during the 1970s. Ziika forest is one of the many small
   forest fragments that fringe the northern part of the lake. This 12 ha
   forest is surrounded by different habitats? giving it the appearance of
   a terrestrial iisland'. Birds were first ringed here from September
   1970-July 1972. A follow-up was made in 1988-89, during which 186 birds
   from 27 different species were ringed. Five years later, survival rates
   were found to be significantly higher than the expected. Some species
   appeared to survive better than others. There are various assumptions
   made in estimating survival rates of understorey birds.}},

Abstract = {{During April 1994, 144 Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber chicks were
   taken from Etosha Pan, Namibia, following drying of the shallow water
   and the death of hundreds of chicks. The captured chicks ranged from
   approximately 2 weeks to 2 months of age and were hand-reared at
   Okaukuejo until being released (7 weeks later) or sold (12 weeks later).
   Fourteen birds died within 8 days; only two died later. Of 77 chicks
   released at Walvis Bay, their traditional wintering grounds, 76 were
   fitted with yellow plastic rings and 73 with numbered metal rings. These
   grey juveniles were highly visible in the lagoon among the pink adults,
   and were resighted regularly. Most of the 20 birds recovered dead within
   two months of release were birds with wing chord measurements less than
   315 mm. and black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas predation was the most
   likely cause of death. Bird counts 11 and 14 months later at Walvis Bay
   and surrounding wetlands revealed no juveniles at all, suggesting high
   mortality. However, four ringed flamingos were sighted in Jan. 1997, and
   one debilitated ringed flamingo was recovered at the Namibia-Botswana
   border in Feb. 1997. A lack of predator avoidance was thought to be the
   main factor responsible for the high mortalities.}},

Abstract = {{The success of 16 nesting areas (territories) of Martial Eagles was
   monitored for seven successive years (1988-1994) in a protected area in
   the Kalahari desert of South Africa. Martial Eagles mostly laid in
   consecutive years (38 out of 53 attempts) and fledged, on average, 0.43
   young/pair/year (38/88). Most Martial Eagles laid eggs in May and June
   (72.2\%; n = 13 attempts). Almost all located Martial Eagle nests were
   in the Acacia erioloba savanna in the dry Auob and Nossob riverbeds.
   Martial Eagle nesting areas were spaced at intervals of 24.1 km (1134.6
   km; n = 6) along the Nossob River, 15.1 km (8-34 km; n = 7) in the Auob
   River and 31.3 km (25-43 km, n = 4) in the interior dune area. A total
   of between 20 and 30 Martial Eagle pairs (20 known active nesting areas)
   occurred in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park during the study period.
   There was no evidence of a decline in active nesting areas of Martial
   Eagles during the seven year study. There was no safe buffer zone around
   the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park and Martial Eagles were at times
   persecuted when foraging in the adjacent farmlands.}},

Abstract = {{The closely related Blackeyed Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus, Cape Bulbul P.
   capensis and Redeyed Bulbul P. nigricans have parapatric to locally
   sympatric distributions within southern Africa. Extensive hybridization
   along narrow transition zones between each of the three species pairs is
   described in a region of the Eastern Cape province, South Africa. The
   transition zones coincide with ecotones between different vegetation
   types, which in turn follow escarpments or mountain ranges. The lack of
   population density depressions within the hybrid zones, together with
   the variability of the hybrids, suggests the hybrids are viable. Sharp
   step dines in various phenotypic characters are described across the P.
   barbatus/P. nigricans hybrid zone. A mtDNA analysis found evidence of
   possible introgression between P. barbatus and P. capensis. All eight P.
   barbatus x P. nigricans hybrids analysed possessed P. barbatus mtDNA,
   suggesting the existence of either positive assortative mating or strong
   directional selection, but our data are unable to distinguish which. Our
   results do not support the dynamic-equilibrium model, but are compatible
   with the bounded-hybrid-superiority model. We conclude that the
   maintenance of the parapatric distributions of the different taxa is due
   mainly to differences in environmentally-associated fitness between
   parental phenotypes or among parental and hybrid phenotypes along an
   ecotone, with the narrowness of the hybrid zones maintained by the
   steepness of the environmental gradients crossing them.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution records obtained from the South African Bird Atlas Project
   (SABAP) and from published literature show that the known distribution
   of Redbilled Quelea in the Eastern Cape has changed dramatically over
   the last century. Increased search effort following the initiation of
   SABAP may explain the range expansion, but changes in agricultural
   practice have probably been a contributing factor.}},

Abstract = {{Avian response to landscape elements (tesserae) at Camp Andrew, Lion's
   River Farming District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was measured in
   terms of abundance, occupancy and diversity per tessera. Flight paths
   between the tesserae were also quantified. As expected, occupancy varied
   from highest in the least disturbed tessera chill-grass) to lowest in
   exotic-plant and disturbed tesserae (wattle and mown-grass). Abundance
   and diversity, however, did not show this trend, but varied
   independently of whether the tesserae were natural, disturbed or exotic.
   Continuity diagrams, depicting the movement patterns of birds, show that
   avian response to heterogeneity was influenced by the relative
   suitability of each tessera. The life history traits of a given species
   may explain its unique response to a given tessera. A knowledge of avian
   responses to landscape pattern is important for conservation-management
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys for the Madagascar Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides were
   conducted each breeding season (May through October) from 1991 through
   1995 between Morondava and Antsiranana, western to northwestern
   Madagascar, to estimate the population size of this endangered species.
   Suitable habitat including lakes, rivers, estuaries, mangroves, and
   marine islands was searched and at least 222 adult Madagascar Fish
   Eagles were observed including 63 breeding pairs, 36 probable pairs, 24
   single adults and 18 immature birds. Assuming that all probable pairs
   were breeding, we estimated the Madagascar Fish Eagle breeding
   population was 99 pairs (95\% confidence interval = 78 to 120) in the
   area searched. This estimate is about twice the number previously
   estimated in the period 1980-1985, due mainly, we believe, to our
   greater search effort, although we cannot discount an increase in the
   breeding population. The number of breeding pairs has declined since
   1985 in some localities, suggesting a population decline or movement of
   pairs away from these sites. We recommend annual monitoring of a random
   sample of known breeding pairs until causes for the species' rarity have
   been limited and no evidence of population decline is detected, followed
   by monitoring at least every five years until the species can be removed
   from the endangered list.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty non-breeding bird species have been identified on Europa Island.
   Twenty-two species are new records for the island. The most common
   migrants are six species of Palearctic shorebirds, and the Subantarctic
   Skua. Seven other species of Palearctic migrants and two species
   originating from Africa or Madagascar have been recorded more than once
   but in very low numbers. Finally, 15 species among which 8 are land
   birds have been recorded only once on Europa, between March 1993 and
   April 1996. These results are discussed and compared with other data
   from Madagascar and other oceanic islands of the Malagasy Region. Most
   species mentioned on Europa are regular migrants, accidental vagrants or
   breeding species of Madagascar or other oceanic islands. However eight
   species have never been recorded in Madagascar and two of these species
   have never been recorded on any other oceanic island of the area.}},

   known anywhere. The lower Miocene specimen of Leptoptilos is one of the
   earliest records of a modern-type stork in Africa, and the first
   occurrence of a modern stork in North Africa. The addition of these two
   specimens, together with other ciconiid material from younger Miocene
   sites in Tunisia, gives North Africa the most complete record of fossil
   storks. The presence of these specimens in North Africa is consistent
   with paleoenvironmental reconstructions of northern Egypt during the

Abstract = {{On upland Mauritius, an endemic and an introduced species of fody Foudia
   (weavers Ploceidae) breed sympatrically and simultaneously: the
   Mauritius Fody F. rubra and Madagascar Fody F. madagascariensis. The
   nests of the two species are similar in most respects. However, in both
   architecture (thick walls and copious lining) and material thigh
   proportion of apparently rot-resistant materials), the nest of the
   endemic species seems better suited to the cool, very wet, local
   climate. Madagascar Fodies' nests in the same area lack an inner lining,
   have thin walls and are composed of a limited selection of materials,
   the choice of which seems relatively undiscerning. A possible
   explanation for this difference is suggested. Both species build an
   outer roofing layer on top of their nests, which has not been fully
   documented before, is unknown in other genera and may be a waterproofing
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{The Red Lark Certhilauda burm is a narrow-range endemic potentially
   threatened by habitat degradation. Three taxa have been described, but
   currently no subspecies are recognised. We examined geographic variation
   to ensure that significant variation is not overlooked in a conservation
   plan for the species. There are regional differences in plumage pattern,
   but with the possible exception of the eastern dune population aridula,
   these forms overlap and apparently interbreed. Three mitochondrial DNA
   haplotypes were detected among nine individuals sampled across the
   species' range, but again with the possible exception of aridula there
   was no geographic segregation of these forms. Male display songs vary
   geographically, but overall song structure is consistent throughout the
   range. Despite being largely resident within its fragmented range, there
   is some evidence of occasional movement which presumably is sufficient
   to maintain genetic interchange. We conclude that the Red Lark is a
   single species, but there are differences between habitats and an ideal
   conservation plan would include three areas: the north-western dune
   systems, the south-central alluvial plains, and the eastern dunes.
   Priority should be given to the eastern dunes, which support the
   smallest and perhaps most threatened population.}},

Abstract = {{At Malgas Island, Western Cape Province, South Africa, active nest sites
   of Kelp Gulls were recorded from August to February, but mainly between
   October and December with a peak in November. In August and September
   all active sites were recently-made scrapes without eggs or chicks. Eggs
   were found from early October until January and chicks from late October
   to early February. At Dassen Island, Western Cape Province, numbers of
   adult Kelp Gulls are highest during the main October-December breeding
   season. After breeding, adults disperse from the island, with only 4\%
   remaining by May. First-year birds were observed at Dassen Island from
   February to July, with mean numbers decreasing after April. At De Hoop,
   Western Cape Province, numbers of Kelp Gulls were also highest during
   the breeding season, but the decrease in the non-breeding season was
   less marked. Near Walvis Bay, central Namibia, at a non-breeding site,
   numbers of Kelp Gulls were highest outside the breeding season,
   indicating dispersal of birds away from colonies after completion of
   breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition may influence the outcome of bird
   introductions on oceanic islands. Two patterns that are consistent with
   this hypothesis are morphological overdispersion and priority effect.
   Here, we test for morphological overdispersion in the introduced
   passeriform birds on the island of Saint Helena. A total of 31
   passeriform species has been introduced to Saint Helena, of which five
   remain today. The overwhelming majority (23) of introduced species are
   finches. We thus conducted our morphological analyses on two groups;
   finches and all passeriforms. The finches introduced on Saint Helena
   tend toward morphological overdispersion; however, all passeriforms do
   not. We hypothesize that the pattern of overdispersion found among the
   finches is due to increased species richness within this group.}},

   described, based on field observations and tape recordings from which
   sonagrams were produced. These species, which are locally sympatric and

   apparent in their contact calls and songs. Quantitative analysis of the
   songs showed that P. barbatus and P. capensis are easily distinguished,
   whereas the song characteristics of P. nigricans overlap those of both
   the other species. Playback experiments with territorial male P.
   barbatus in an area of allopatry showed similar responses to songs of
   conspecifics and of P. nigricans, but almost no response to the song of
   P. capensis.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting success at 13 nesting territories of Bateleur Terathopius
   ecaudatus and 19 nesting territorites of Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax was
   monitored for seven successive years (1988-1994) in a protected area in
   the Kalahari desert of South Africa. On average Bateleurs laid one year
   in two (51/95 pair-years) and fledged 0.33 young/pair/year (31/95).
   Tawny Eagles laid, on average, in two out of three years (66/105), and
   fledged 0.4 young/pair/year (42/105). Most Bateleurs laid eggs in
   January and February, while Tawny Eagles mostly laid from May to June.
   Almost all Bateleur and Tau;ny Eagle nesting territories located were in
   the Acacia erioloba savanna in the dry Auob and Nossob riverbeds.
   Bateleur nesting territories were spaced at intervals of 7.2 km
   (2.5-14.6 km; n = 9) along the Nossob River. Tawny Eagle nesting
   territories were spaced at intervals of 17.6 km (6.1-32.7 km) in the
   Nossob River and 11.3 km (8-14 km) in the Auob River respectively. A
   total of 13 Bateleur and 30-40 Tawny Eagle nesting territories (27 known
   active nesting territories) respectively occurred in the Kalahari
   Gemsbok National Park during the study period. There was evidence of a
   13\% decline in active nesting territories of Bateleur during the seven
   year study, and at least a 40\% decline over the previous 10 years.
   Vacated nesting territories were not reoccupied. There was no safe
   buffer zone around the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park and persecution in
   the adjacent farmlands, when foraging Bateleur from the protected Park
   enter these areas; as well as nesting site disturbance, could have been
   part of the reason for this decline. Poisoned and suspected poisoned
   Bateleurs have been found in the Park during the study period. There was
   no obvious decline in active Tawny Eagle nesting territories.}},

   Coleoptera. There were marked differences in nestling food between two
   breeding seasons at the same site. The proportion of larvae of

Abstract = {{Following the discovery of a single pair of Jackass Penguins Spheniscus
   demersus nesting on the mainland at Stony Point, Western Cape Province,
   South Africa (34 22S 18 53E) in 1982,a colony developed and has since
   been regularly monitored. Numbers of nests increased to 35 in 1986,
   until a leopard Panthera pardus severely reduced the size of the colony.
   Numbers subsequently rose again to a total of 139 nests in 1990, but
   fell to 57 in 1993. This decrease was probably due to predation by
   mammals. Following the use of a trap and translocation of the animals
   caught, the colony increased again in 1995 and 1996. Productivity of the
   colony was insufficient for it to be self-sustaining, and it therefore
   presently represents a population sink.}},

Abstract = {{The Mauritius Black Bulbul Hypsipetes olivaceus is a threatened
   passerine endemic to Mauritius. Direct observations of food items
   indicate that it is an arboreal omnivore. Animal prey consists mostly of
   insects and native day-geckoes (Phelsuma spp.). A wide variety of native
   and exotic fruits is also taken. The species is apparently monogamous,
   With an egg-laying season extending from at least November to February,
   usual clutch and brood sizes of two to three, ability rapidly to lay
   repeat clutches in a new nest, and post-breeding complete moult. In
   these respects, its annual cycle resembles that of the other native
   Mauritian passerines. It occurs at very low population density compared
   to its Indian Ocean congeners; possible reasons for this are given.}},

Journal = {{OSTRICH}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Formerly six or eight species of seabirds bred on Tromelin Island, but
   currently only two species do so: The Redfooted Booby Sula sula and the
   Masked Booby S. dactylatra. The last two species which became locally
   extinct, the Lesser Frigatebird Fregata oriel and the Greater
   Frigatebird F. mirror, probably stopped breeding on the island as a
   consequence of human disturbance to breeding colonies. The populations
   of the two species of booby have opposing trends since 1954. The Masked
   Booby's population increased from 60 pairs in 1954 to 200-250 pairs in
   1996 while the Red-footed Booby's population decreased from 500 pairs in
   1968 to 130-180 pairs in 1996. The impacts of human settlement,
   introduced brown rats Rattus norvegicus, local extinction of the Greater
   Frigatebird and other factors are discussed to explain these changes in
   population sizes. New data are provided on the breeding phenology of the
   two species of booby. Finally, the importance of this island for the
   conservation of seabirds in the western Indian Ocean is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Benson's Rockthrush Pseudocossyphus bensoni, described in 1971, was
   previously thought to have a limited range in central southwestern
   Madagascar centred around the Isalo Massif. Recent ornithological
   surveys of the high mountain zone of the Reserve Naturelle Integrale
   d'Andringitra, about 170 km east of the Isalo Massif and of the
   Isoky-Vohimena Forest, 60 km west of the Isalo Massif, found substantial
   populations of I? bensoni inhabiting these areas. In this paper we
   provide information on the Andringitra Massif and the Isoky-Vohimena
   Forest populations of this species, as well as summarize other records
   outside previously known areas of its geographical range.}},

Abstract = {{The Redbilled Hornbill Tockus erythrorhynchus is not well known from a
   systematic and ethological point of view even though it ranges over a
   large part of sub-Saharan Africa. A study in Senegal involved 80 hours
   of observation on the two main stages of nest-preparation : bringing of
   materials and partial sealing of the nest entrance. During the first
   phase of nest preparation, the male spent more time inspecting, feeding
   and preening; the female took more material into the nest than the male.
   In the second phase of nest preparation, the female sealed the nest
   entrance by herself and rested less than the male. It is the role of the
   male to choose the breeding site and to defend the nest. The female's
   primary role is to choose the materials for the interior of the nest and
   also to block the entrance with mud. The male brings various lining or
   building materials which the female may choose to use or to reject. A
   few days before the female seals herself into the nest, she opens up and
   re-closes the nest entrance, once from the outside and once from the
   inside so as to be able to exit and enter the nest at will.}},

Abstract = {{The non-breeding hunting behaviour of members of mixed flocks of Lesser
   Kestrels Falco naumanni and Eastern Redfooted Falcons Falco amurensis
   was studied during January 1991 in the Transvaal Province of South
   Africa. Both species employed perch-hunting and hover hunting to catch
   their insectivorous prey. Only 46.8\% of Lesser Kestrel and 49.8\% of
   Eastern Redfooted Falcon strikes were successful, with perch-hunting
   more successful than hover-hunting in both species (59\% vs 39\% and
   59\% vs 41\% respectively). Hover-hunting resulted in a significantly
   higher strike rate (47 strikes.hr(-1) vs 14 strikes.hr(-1); 34
   strikes.hr(-1) vs 15.5 strikes.h(-1)) and kill rate (18 kill.hr(-1) vs 9
   kills.hr(-1); 14 kills.hr(-1) vs 9 kills.hr(-1)) than perch-hunting for
   both species. Eastern Redfooted Falcons hovered for significantly longer
   (6.5 seconds vs 5.5 sec) and more often than Lesser Kestrels, but with
   no significant differences in hover-hunting and perch-hunting strike
   success, strike rate or kill rate. There were no significant differences
   in linear dimensions or mass loading between the sexes of both species
   and Lesser Kestrels showed no significant differences in hunting
   performance between the sexes. Eastern Redfooted Falcon females had
   significantly lower strike success (45.9\% vs 64\%) and kill rate (7
   items.hr(-1) vs 11 items.hr(-1)) than males. This may be due to the
   inclusion of immature birds in the female sample. Under similar
   environmental conditions, hunting behaviour differed little between the
   two species or between sexes of the same species, as expected in species
   with only slight interspecific and sexual size dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Tissues as well as the stomach contents of an apparently sick, male,
   juvenile Purple Heron Ardea purpurea (477 g body weight) were analysed
   for 13 metals. The bird was caught in the industrial area of Germiston
   on the East Rand of Johannesburg. The gross pathological abnormalities
   observed in this heron were similar to those found in birds that died
   from exposure to acute concentrations of lead-containing compounds. The
   aluminium and lead residues were considered to be indicative of acute
   exposure whilst the concentration of cadmium was indicative of chronic
   exposure. Silver was not detected in all the samples analysed.
   Concentrations of cobalt, manganese and strontium were generally smaller
   than 100 mu g/g dry mass whilst chromium, copper, nickel, zinc and
   antimony were smaller than 500 mu g/g. Iron occurred in the highest
   concentrations in all tissues. Comparisons with other Ardeidae indicated
   that this juvenile Purple Heron generally had higher metal residues than
   either fledgling, juveniles or adults from unpolluted and polluted
   areas. Therefore, the death of this Purple Heron might be attributed to
   the synergistic action of a combination of metals.}},

   low and high tide during two summers (1975-76 and 1976-77) and two
   winters (1975 and 1976) at Langebaan Lagoon. Intertidal sandflats
   supported higher densities of waders than saltmarshes at low tide in
   summer (18.7 and 17.2 waders ha(-1) on sandflats compared with 0.4 and
   2.9 waders ha(-1) on saltmarshes) and winter (0.9 and 3.1 compared with
   0.6 and 1.9 waders ha(-1) for the two years). At high tide, most waders
   moved onto saltmarshes, attaining densities of 70.4 and 53.6 waders
   ha(-1) in the two summers, and 5.7 and 15.6 birds ha(-1) in the two
   winters. Resident waders comprised 0.3 and 0.8\% of the wader community
   in the two summers and 41 and 5\% in the two winters. They were also at
   higher densities in winter than in summer. The composition of wader
   communities on the different sandflats varied little in summer and
   Curlew Sandpipers were the most abundant species on all sandflats. Mine;
   variations in species composition included proportionately more
   Turnstones at the mouth of the lagoon, more Sanderlings and Whimbrels in
   the mid sections and more Terek Sandpipers, Greenshanks and Curlews in
   the upper part. Larger percentages of waders were foraging on the
   sandflats at low tide in both summer (96 and 92\% for the two summers)
   and winter (85 and 94\% for the two winters) compared with the
   saltmarshes (73 and 79\% in the two summers and 60 and 81\% in the two
   winters). A larger proportion of small waders were foraging on sandflats
   at low tide compared with large waders. At high tide on the saltmarshes,
   the percent of foraging birds was lower in summer (29\% for both
   summers) than in winter (36 and 78\% for the two winters), perhaps
   reflecting seasonal changes in energy requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative breeding in birds may be difficult to detect without marking
   techniques, and the breeding biology of most bird species in South
   Africa has not been intensively studied. Prediction of cooperative
   breeding from ecological and life-history traits may be useful in that
   helping can be specifically looked for in species having a certain set
   of such traits. Generalised Linear models, with legit-link functions,
   were used to predict which relatively poorly-studied terrestrial South
   African bird species had at least equal odds of being either facultative
   cooperative breeders or regular cooperative breeders compared with
   noncooperative breeders. Hole-nesters in steppe habitat and species
   nesting on water were likely to be facultative cooperative breeders.
   Species which feed in permanent groups and have altricial young are
   likely to be regular cooperative breeders. Significant linear-by-linear
   interaction effects were found between the ordered cooperative breeding
   variable and the ordered hatchling type and feeding dispersion
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{Details of 56 active and 18 potential nest sites of the Southern Ground
   Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri were recorded in the Kruger National Park,
   South Africa, over 298 nest-seasons during 1967-95. Nests were natural
   cavities with a median diameter of about 40 cm, 96\% situated in 12
   species of trees and 4\% in rock faces. Only four species of tree
   provided 72\% of nest sites and 85\% of active nest sites were formed by
   rotting of a damaged branch or trunk. No habitat preference associated
   with nest sites was detected, but 61\% of nests were within 400 m of a
   tourist road, possibly due to lower predation pressure. Nest
   attractiveness was correlated positively with nest height, cavity
   shallowness and proximity to tourist roads, but nest success was not
   correlated with any measured features of the sites. Average cavity
   durability was 14 years, but differed between tree species from 5-26
   years. Nest site availability appeared to be the principal factor
   limiting the Southern Ground Hornbill population of the Kruger National
   Park. The limited choice of sites, and the potential for site
   modification and substitution, have important implications for wild and
   captive management and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The Mauritius Cuckoo-shrike Coracina typica, a threatened passerine
   endemic to Mauritius, was studied between 1989 and 1993. Previously
   undocumented immature plumages are elucidated. From observation of 364
   food items, the diet was found to be mainly large, arboreal arthropods
   (81-90 \%) and day-geckoes (10 \%), with 9 \% of items unidentified but
   possibly arthropods. Geckoes, the largest items, formed more than 10 \%
   of the total biomass eaten. Individuals varied in the items selected.
   The species appeared to be sedentary, territorial and monogamous.
   Egg-laying occurred from September to February, with a complete
   post-breeding moult. Both sexes built the nest, incubated and fed the
   young. From laying to fledging took around 50 days, with a further
   three-month dependency period; such protracted development is typical of
   the family. The diet and foraging methods may in part explain the
   species' current restricted distribution and habitat selection within
   Mauritius, but the species may, like many other island birds, prove more
   ecologically flexible than it at first appears.}},

Abstract = {{About 40 species of piscivorous birds have been recorded on Lake Kariba
   (Zimbabwe Zambia) but only 26 were observed during this study, carried
   out in 1986-87. The Reed Cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus was the most
   numerous and made up 51.4\% of all the birds seen, followed by the
   Whitewinged Black Tern Chlidonias leucoptera (26.7\%), and the Darter
   Anhinga melanogaster (10.8\%). Several species roosted or bred in the
   drowned trees which project above the lake surface but gently sloping
   shores were the most important feeding grounds. Relatively few birds
   were seen on steeply sloping shores or in open water. There was a
   distinct pattern of seasonal abundance, with birds being most numerous
   in the rainy season (November-April). The relative abundance of some
   fish species also was greatest during this period. There was a positive
   relationship between the numbers of some bird species and the relative
   abundance of these fish. The mean density of piscivores (0.05 ha(-1))
   was low compared to some other African waters. This is attributed to the
   fact that Lake Kariba is relatively deep and its shoreline is mostly
   steep. The mean population of 25 000 birds consumed less than 1000 t of
   fish per annum, compared to almost 40000 t taken by the commercial
   fisheries. A considerable portion of the birds' diet was fish that were
   not taken commercially.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of Crab Plovers is directly analogous to the
   `walk-stop-search-walk' hunting behaviour of true plovers, and changes
   slightly depending whether the birds are foraging on sand or in water:
   they are nonterritorial when foraging. Crabs dominate the diet, but
   other invertebrates and fish are also eaten. Foraging efficiency
   increases with age and adults and subadults are able to satisfy their
   daily energy requirements in a single tidal cycle. The population of
   Crab Plovers at Mida Creek was much larger in 1994 than in 1992, but in
   1994 adults achieved much higher intake rates than in 1992, suggesting
   considerable year-to-year variation in the carrying capacity of Mida
   Creek for Crab Plovers. The world population of 43-50 000 birds breeds
   at very few colonies and the species is thus a potential conservation
   concern. Because of the relative accessibility of large concentrations
   of Crab Plovers away from the breeding grounds, we suggest that a
   programme to monitor numbers and population demography should be
   targeted at nonbreeding aggregations.}},

Abstract = {{The biology of the Pintailed Whydah Vidua macroura was studied at the
   Kakamega Forest, western Kenya. This species is sexually dimorphic in
   plumage and size (males are brighter, long tailed and larger). Males
   defended large (1.4 ha) territories which contained areas of bare ground
   (9\% of total area) suitable for feeding on grass seeds such as Paspalum
   scrobiculatum. There were two breeding peaks: during the long rains
   (April-August) and the short rains (November-December). Territorial
   interactions were frequent; a previously unreported tail-up/bill-wiping
   display is described. Females frequently visited male territories and
   were pursued and courted by the males. Male tarsus length was weakly,
   but positively, related to the size of feeding area (a possible
   indicator of territory quality), but there were no other significant
   correlates with territory size, or frequency of intrusions. There were
   no significant correlates of female visitation rates (which do correlate
   with copulation frequency), so the basis of female choice (if any)
   remains unknown. Although this species has been classified as an
   exploded lekker, the possibility that females are attracted to resources
   (such as grass seeds) cannot be ruled out. Tail streamer length was not
   more variable than other morphological traits when fully grown, but was
   much more variable at the start of the breeding season while still
   growing.}},

   season. The total trans-equatorial distance between the breeding and
   non-breeding ranges was 3520 km. During the non-breeding season the bird
   ranged over a large area (ca. 60 000 km(2)) for about six weeks (29
   April - 14 June) in these three countries in a rather nomadic pattern
   covering a minimum distance of 1256 km. During two further months (14
   June - 14 August) it restricted its movements to an area of about 5000
   km(2) near Maiduguri in the Sudan savannah of north-eastern Nigeria. The
   return migration took about two weeks longer than that to the north,

Abstract = {{The breeding success and mating relationships between individuals of a
   marked population of African Jacanas Actophilornis africana were
   compared in years of low and high rainfall during which habitat
   conditions differed. In the flood year the breeding season was 30\%
   longer than in the drought year, more birds bred (27-29 vs 8), more
   clutches were laid (39 vs 16) and hatching success was much greater
   (36\% vs 0\%). In the flood year all breeding females (n = 7) had
   polyandrous matings (with between 2-7 males) whereas in the drought year
   only two of five breeding females were polyandrous. In the drought year
   opportunities for females to mate polyandrously were minimal because of
   the rapid rate of clutch loss the aggressive behaviour of dominant males
   which prevented access of lower ranked males to breeding females. Higher
   clutch survival in the flood year enabled females to lay successive
   clutches for more males.}},

Abstract = {{Secretarybirds in three adjacent territories were monitored from 1977 to
   1988 on grass- and croplands near Pretoria, South Africa. Most
   observations of breeding biology and behaviour confirmed or extended
   previous studies. There was no correlation between pairs in occupancy of
   territory, productivity or development periods of young: this confirms
   the flexible breeding abilities which are unusual for such a large bird.
   Some aspects of breeding biology (egg shape and texture, watering of
   chicks) and behaviour (Wings open and Up-down greeting displays) may be
   homologous with storks and important in understanding the phylogeny and
   evolution of the Sagitariidae and other diurnal raptors.}},

Abstract = {{Several types of organochlorine residues were found in eggs of Peregrine
   Falcons Falco peregrinus minor taken in Zimbabwe in 1990. DDE (range =
   0.2-22 ppm wet weight; geometric mean 1.8 ppm) was found in all eggs (n
   = 15) from 13 sites, including two pairs in captivity. Eggs from two
   sites in the mid-Zambezi Valley, the most recently and heavily sprayed
   areas (5-8 times for tsetse fly Glossina sp. control), had the highest
   levels, one beyond that regarded as critical for successful
   reproduction. Mean shell thickness (Ratcliffe index) of the 1990 eggs
   was 10\% (range = 2-29\%) lower than the presumed pre-DDT mean. HEOD was
   detected in two eggs, HCB in one egg, and PCBs in all eggs, but at
   levels too low to affect breeding performance. Young were fledged from
   each of 12 sampled sites, yielding 1.86 young per site.}},

   It is concluded that Whitechinned Petrels at Marion Island are similarly

Abstract = {{During July-December 1992, the diet, home range, hunting and
   reproductive behaviour of a pair of Dickinson's Kestrel Falco dickinsoni
   was recorded in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Numerically, for
   both sexes combined, invertebrates formed the majority (56\%) of the
   diet, while separately the female caught 75\% and the male 49\%
   invertebrate prey. During courtship and incubation the male supplied the
   female with primarily vertebrate prey and both provisioned mainly
   vertebrates to the nestlings (male = 80\%; female = 57\%). The
   non-breeding home range of the female was 27.8 km(2), and the breeding
   home range of the male was 26.3 lan. Both utilised their home ranges
   differentially, the area within a 2 km radius of the nest (12.6 km(2))
   being used proportionally more than the remaining area. The home range
   of the female was compared to that of other Falco spp. and was larger
   than would be expected based on body weight. Perch-hunting was the only
   technique utilised by both sexes, with 79-80\% of observed strike
   attempts from dead trees. During the: day, the female spent 87\% and the
   male 77\% of the time perch-hunting, with respective hunting success
   rates of 69\% and 58\%. During courtship, the female spent much of her
   time (94\%) close to the nest, where the male supplied her with prey.
   During incubation, the male spent 95\% of his time within 2 km of the
   nest tree, where he hunted to supply the female with and assisted in
   nest defence. On occasion the male entered the nest to relieve female,
   and remained in the cavity on average for 134 min (n = 5). As the young
   got older, the female spent less time at the nest and provisioned more
   items to the nestlings. Overall, there was an increase in the rate of
   prey provisioning to the nestlings from 0.45 items.hr(-1) (10 days old)
   to 0.85 items.hr(-1) (21 days old). The male initially passed prey to
   the female but provisioned directly to older nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Blue-naped Mousebirds are altricial birds that are naked and blind at
   hatching. The nestling period is extremely short (12.5+/-0.8 d). During
   the first 7 days the nestlings are unable to thermoregulate actively but
   from 3 day old the nestlings already show approximately the same body
   temperature (T-b) as adults under `'natural conditions'' in the nest
   with siblings. At an ambient temperature (T-a) of + 35 degrees C the
   nestlings are nearly endothermic by the age of 9 days (T-b 39.1+/-0.8
   degrees C) and within 12 days individual birds are essentially
   endothermic at T-a + 20 degrees C (T-b 39.4+/-0.4 degrees C = 97\% of
   adult-T-b). At this age the birds leave the nest. They are sufficiently
   feathered but still unable to fly and have only reached 55\% of adult
   mass. Coordinated shivering thermogenesis was observed for the first
   time on day 6 (T-a + 20 degrees C), and panting and gular fluttering for
   cooling from day 4. Torpor, as a special energy saving mechanism, was
   shown first at an age of about 10 days (T-a + 15 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{The data contained in a catalogue of avian haematozoa for sub-Saharan
   Africa were examined in the light of the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis. The
   males of 464 passerine species were assigned six brightness scores. The
   generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and logistic link
   function is shown to be the appropriate statistical tool for analysing
   blood parasite data. With caveats, results from the model supported the
   prediction that bright males tend to be parasitized more frequently.
   However, the group of species with the highest brightness score, had
   infection rates similar to the dullest group. When phylogenetic
   associations were taken into account, support for the Hamilton-Zuk
   hypothesis was equivocal. Further research on the ecology and natural
   history of the interactions between blood parasites, their vectors and
   the birds they infest is needed to decide whether the differences
   between the lowest and highest infestation rates (23\% for the dullest
   species and 37\% for the penultimate brightness score) are biologically
   meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing human activity in sensitive dune areas may negatively impact
   dune-breeding birds. The aim of this study was to survey populations of
   dune-breeding birds along 237 km of sand and dune coastline between
   Huisklip and The Great Fish River, Eastern Cape. The numbers of
   Whitefronted Plovers Charadrius marginatus, African Black Oystercatchers
   Haematopus moquini and Damara Terns Sterna balaenarum were recorded in
   33 sections along the coast. A total of 589 African Black Oystercatchers
   (2.49 birds/km), 537 Whitefronted Plovers (2.27 birds/km) and 28 Damara
   Terns (0.12 birds/km), were observed. Only one Damara Tern was seen
   outside the Alexandria Dunefield, which provides 74\% of the total
   potential Damara Tern nesting sites in the Eastern Cape. The area
   between the Kabeljous and Maitland Rivers and between the Sundays River
   and Woody Cape (Alexandria Dunefield) are important areas for all
   dune-breeding birds and both areas are heavily utilized by people,
   particularly with off-road vehicles. Although these areas are managed by
   conservation authorities, negative impacts on nestlings have been
   observed; the effects of this are not as yet evident in the population.
   The increasing human activity in coastal areas, especially in
   dunefields, is cause for concern. We recommend these sensitive areas be
   closed to vehicular traffic and that all off-road vehicle use in sandy
   areas be controlled more effectively.}},

Title = {{A comparison of hunting behaviour by each sex of adult greater kestrels
   Falco rupicoloides resident near Pretoria, South Africa}},

Abstract = {{During 1975-79, I observed the hunting behaviour of territorial,
   colour-marked, adult Falco rupicoloides that were resident on grass and
   croplands near Pretoria, South Africa. I recorded 686 strikes by males
   and 796 by females. Both sexes mainly hunted from perches or hovers and
   captured invertebrates <2 g or vertebrates >10 g. In monthly
   comparisons, both sexes made more and shorter strikes from perches when
   moulting and not breeding (December-May). They made more and longer
   strikes at vertebrate prey during courtship (June-August). When breeding
   (September-November), hunting success of males was highest when feeding
   the incubating female. It remained high for both sexes when feeding
   nestlings and both made more strikes from hovers when breeding,
   especially females that also increased the number of bouts of hovering
   preceding a strike. Differences between individuals, in the proportion
   of perch and hover-hunting and the size of prey, were only significant
   during courtship and incubation. Overall, both sexes were 98-99\%
   successful at invertebrates. Males made more strikes than females into
   tall grasslands (30\% vs 14\%), more from perches (77\% vs 49\%), and
   more (23\% vs 6\%) but with lower success (31\% vs 66\%) at vertebrates
   due to more misses at birds. Females made more strikes into short
   grasslands, more at invertebrates, and with more success from hovers
   (96\% vs 66\%). There were also sexual differences in perch heights and
   in hunting behaviour at different times of the day. Sexual differences
   in hunting behaviour may correlate, not only with different sexroles
   during breeding and reversed size dimorphism, but also with differences
   in body proportions, hunting habitat, prey selection or hunting time. I
   propose an epigamic role for energetic pursuit of avian prey and a test
   of this hypothesis.}},

   of the woody forbs Indigofera schimperi (Leguminosae) and orbs Aspilia
   mossambicensis (Compositae). While the diet composition of the Ostrich
   is similar to that of Grant's gazelle, Ostriches differ in that they eat
   some silica rich plants not utilized by ungulates; thus Ostriches may be
   a useful addition to mixed-species game ranching in Africa.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details 6 years' monitoring of breeding Damara Terns Sterna
   balaenarum on Namibia's north-western coast. We report new breeding
   distribution records, factors limiting success on the desert coast and
   detail two new methods of catching terns and a new sexing technique.
   Nests occurred as far north as the Cunene River mouth and occurred
   mainly on open gravel plains up to 8 km from the coast. Eggs occurred
   over an 8 month period with a peak in January. Of 66 nests monitored on
   a daily basis, 72\% succesfully hatched, and most of those failing were
   taken by mammals. Incubation was slightly shorter than reported
   previously (19.2d), and heavier chicks emerged from larger eggs. Adult
   plunge diving success was low and records indicate Skeleton Coast Damara
   Terns brought mainly needle fish Tylosurus sp. to their nestling. Two
   new methods to capture adults were developed, noose catching and hand
   capture, both of which avoided nest desertions, and had success rates of
   up to 70\%. Morphologically the sexes differed significantly in bill
   size, allowing a simple and efficient means to separate male and female
   terns. We conclude that Damara Tern populations are more extensive than
   previously thought and further ringing and monitoring of food resources
   is encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{A colony of Red Bishop birds Euplectes orix in a reed bed near Pretoria
   was studied during two breeding seasons. Breeding activity was greater

   most important source of mortality with 25-30\% of the nests yielding
   fledglings. Between 7 and 11\% of the nests were parasitised by Diederik
   Cuckoos. Reed height and distance from the edge of the reed bed were
   strongly correlated with nest density. From a temporal perspective
   breeding success was highest in late January following the peak in
   breeding activity. These observations suggest that overall breeding
   success is higher when nest densities are low. The mean fledging rate
   per nest was lower in areas of high nest density. This was, however, a
   statistical artifact. Multivariate analyses could not identify any
   environmental factors as predictors of breeding success within a colony.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of Peregrine and Lanner Falcons in South
   Africa was compared using recorded sightings from various sources,
   including the Southern African Bird Atlas Project. Falcon distributions
   were compared with the distribution of cliffs and vegetation, to
   quantify differences in the habitat preferences of the two species in
   the breeding and the non breeding seasons. Lanner Falcons outnumbered
   Peregrine Falcons in most areas by at least 10:1. Peregrine Falcons were
   more habitat specific than Lanner Falcons, in terms of topographic and
   biotic requirements. Peregrine Falcons were largely restricted to high
   cliff areas throughout the year and there probably were no large-scale
   seasonal movements within the population. The bulk of the resident
   Peregrine Falcon population was found in the fynbos biome, in the
   southwestern Cape. Outside of this area, Peregrine Falcons were
   concentrated in woodlands. Lanner Falcons were less dependent on high
   cliffs, although cliff availability was important in defining the ranges
   of both species. Lanner Falcons were most common in the sour grasslands
   in the east of the country in the breeding season, with apparent
   movements in the non-breeding season into the fynbos, the Nama Karoo and
   the southern Kalahari. Overall, Peregrine Falcons favoured relatively
   closed habitats and Lanner Falcons favoured relatively open habitats.
   The differences in the two species' habitat preferences are proximate
   factors influencing distribution and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{I studied the breeding biology of the Crested Barbet Trachyphonus
   vaillantii in Colbyn, a suburb east of Pretoria, South Africa, for nine
   breeding seasons from 1981 to 1989 to examine patterns in annual
   breeding success, breeding attempt success in multiple broods, and
   rainfall. The modal incubation period was 14 days and the nestling
   period ranged from 28 to 31 days. Average clutch size for all the years
   was 3,3 eggs/clutch and there was no significant difference in clutch
   size or number of young fledged/nest between years. On average, Crested
   Barbet pairs made 2,4 breeding attempts/season. There was no difference
   in clutch size or breeding success between the breeding attempts.
   Crested Barbets nesting in natural nests laid on average larger clutches
   than those in artificial nestboxes, but had non-significantly lower
   breeding ci success. Failure to raise Crested Barbet chicks was
   attributed to parasitism by Lesser Honeyguides Indicator minor, bee
   swarms occupying nestboxes, and flooding of natural nests. Breeding
   performance was not correlated with rainfall or adult body size. The
   suburban environment may be less variable than a natural environment,
   resulting in a stable breeding Crested Barbet population.}},

Abstract = {{The haematology and the haemoglobin components of 40 captive, adult
   Blue-naped Mousebirds Urocolius macrourus have been studied. Females
   show significantly lower values in the number of erythrocytes, in the

   haematological parameters (number of erythrocytes and leucocytes,
   haemoglobin content, haematocrit, MCH, MCHC, glucose, differential
   count) are within the expected range for birds of this body mass. The
   blood glucose (mean value: 202,63+/-50,61mg/dl) shows a clear 24-hour
   cycle: During the night (174mg/dl) the concentration is 25,7\% lower
   than during the day (235mg/dl). With respect to the blood parameters,
   mousebirds are characterized chiefly by two reptile-like features: the
   erythrocytes of mousebirds are distinctly larger in length (12,95+/-1,23
   mu m), width (7,12+/-0,75 mu m) and in the volume (132,12+/-20,39 mu
   m(3)) than those of other birds (see Prinzinger \& Misovic 1994).
   Testing of the haemoglobin components showed only HbA to be present in
   all mousebirds tested. HbD, a normal component in most birds, could not
   be found. This is also a typical feature of crocodiles and suggests a
   primitive characteristic.}},

Abstract = {{The Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has compiled a
   comprehensive distributional database for birds. This information is
   potentially valuable to environmental consultants, planners and
   managers. A computer-based routine was developed to enhance the
   usefulness of the information to this user group. The routine produces
   habitat-specific species lists and includes annotations on endemism, Red
   Data status and other relevant information. A hierarchical system of
   habitat categories and indicator and associate species statuses was
   designed to maximize the information which can be derived from the
   databank. The report was designed to facilitate prioritization and
   decision-making. The approach is novel in its use of a species list to
   generate information on habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Little information is available on survival rates of southern hemisphere
   passerines, but two recent studies indicate that Australian passerines
   tend to live longer than their northern hemisphere relatives. The aim of
   this paper is to provide data on survival of some South African

   eleven species (eight genera) of South African passerines were
   calculated using recapture data provided by the South African Bird
   Ringing Unit for birds whose retraps occurred more than 12 months after
   the original ringing. Survival did not depend on either the length of
   the study or body mass. Mean survival rate was similar to that of 32
   species of Australian passerines, which is at least 1,2 greater than
   that of British passerines.}},

Abstract = {{There are three main sources of information on movements and migrations
   of bird populations: observations in the field (including atlassing),
   ringing recoveries and analysis of geographical variation
   (subspeciation) in specimens. In the last case, some individuals move
   into and are collected within the ranges of other subspecies, where
   their different appearance and date of collection reveal their source.
   This paper reviews what can be learnt from critical studies of
   subspeciation in 119 species of southern African birds. In 26 cases
   different populations of nonbreeding migrants from the Palearctic or the
   Southern Ocean can be shown to have different, though usually
   overlapping ranges in southern Africa. Many indigenous breeding species
   show more movement or migration than is commonly appreciated. While
   altitudinal partial migration is well known, and northerly movements of
   40 species are not unexpected, the eastwards movement of arid country
   populations of 37 species in winter, is under-appreciated. Westerly
   movements (six species) are much rarer, while no less than 13 species
   show southerly movements outside the breeding season. Possible reasons
   for these movements are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of terrestrial birds migrate in summer southwestwards
   along the coastal zone of southeastern Africa to breed, followed by a
   reverse migration to wintering grounds in Africa. These migrations were
   investigated using the Southern African Bird Atlas Project data base and
   the reporting rate as an index of relative abundance. Models of
   seasonality in the reporting rate for 18 bird species in each of pix
   coastal areas from the southwestern Cape to northern Natal were fitted
   using Fourier series and generalized linear models. Altitudinal
   movements of each species were investigated in the two northernmost
   zones (Natal). New migration patterns are suggested for the Mangrove
   Kingfisher Halcyon senegaloides and the currently accepted migration
   movements of the Natal Robin Cossypha natalensis, Knysna Warbler
   Bradyterus sylvaticus and Dusky Flycatcher Muscicapa adusta are
   rejected. Known migrations are confirmed in greater detail for Pygmy
   Kingfisher Ispidina picta, Black Sawwing Swallow Psalinoprocne
   holomelas, Starred Robin Pogoncichla stellata and Paradise Flycatcher
   Terpsiphone viridis. Several factors other than migration may explain an
   increase in winter reporting rates for some resident forest species. The
   migration of the Spotted Thrush Zoothera guttata in southern Africa is
   apparently a truncated form of the migration existing in other forest
   bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Masked Weavers (n = 544) were caught randomly during `'measured effort
   ringing'' in southeastern Botswana between January 1991 and January
   1994. Furthermore, samples were taken at a roost near Gaborone (n = 248)
   in June 1993 and at Maun (n = 173) in northern Botswana in August 1993.
   Clear differences were found between the samples in terms of sex and age
   structure. Masked Weavers are evidently partial migrants in southeastern
   Botswana. A large proportion of the juveniles emigrated during winter
   and during the very dry winter of 1992, most adult females also moved
   out. Adult males were more sedentary.}},

Abstract = {{The province of Natal, South Africa, ranges from sea level to an
   elevation of 3 000 m over a distance of only 160 km. Evidence from the
   literature and from ringing shows that at least 76 species of birds are
   altitudinal migrants in Natal, moving to lower elevations in winter
   (from about March to September). Most can be grouped roughly into four
   categories depending on their breeding areas (montane, high- or
   mid-altitude) and the distances over which they migrate (short-distance
   or long-distance): (A) montane to high-altitude, (B) high-altitude to
   mid-altitude, (C) high-altitude to low-altitude and (D) mid-altitude to
   low-altitude; there is some overlap between the categories, some species
   falling into two or even three altitudinal migration patterns. Birds in
   category (A) move to lower altitudes from the Afromontane region of the
   Drakensberg regularly or only when winter weather conditions are very
   severe, but some individuals can be found there at all times (15
   species). Those in category (B), numbering at least 16 species, leave
   the Afromontane and high-altitude regions altogether, but may be found
   at all times of the year from the submontane region (below about 3 000
   m) to the midlands (down to about 1 000 m). Long-distance migrants in
   categories (C) (12 species) and (D) (29 species) include all the
   remaining bird species, many individuals of which regularly reach the
   coastal littoral of Natal, though not all individuals of which
   necessarily migrate. Fifteen species cannot be categorically placed
   without further knowledge of their breeding and non-breeding quarters.
   Only further ringing will show both the proportions of migrants within a
   population and the distances over which they migrate each winter.}},

   the winter influx of sunbirds which we have observed: the birds may be
   (1) `'winter residents'', which move annually to a wintering area and
   remain there; (2) `'shoppers'', which periodically investigate feeding
   areas within their home range and feed opportunistically where nectar is
   most abundant; (3) `'tourists'', which successively visit a series of
   sites on a regular itinerary; (4) `'nomads'', which move unpredictably
   to new areas whenever food supplies decline. and have no home base.
   Current data on sunbird movements are reviewed, and in a few cases the
   winter resident model is unlikely, but generally it is not yet possible
   to eliminate any of the hypotheses. Moult cycles based on both field and
   museum studies may provide additional information, as movements are
   unlikely while active wing-moult is in progress; some species show
   interrupted wing-moult, which may be associated with long-distance
   flights.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of seasonal movement by Rock Kestrels Falco tinnunculus and
   Lanner Falcons F, biarmicus in South Africa were determined using data
   from the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, road transect; counts,
   ringing recoveries and other sources. Both species were found to be
   partial, facultative migrants, and Lanner Falcon movements involved
   mostly immature birds. Rock Kestrels were found to concentrate in the
   southwest of the country in the breeding season, and to move north and
   east in the non-breeding season. Lanner Falcons concentrated in the east
   of the country during the breeding season, and moved into the west in
   the non-breeding season. The movement by both species into the arid
   northwest of the country is probably associated with dramatic increases
   in prey abundance, in turn associated with summer rain events. Lanner
   Falcon movement into the southern Cape apparently coincides with cereal
   farming practices, affecting the availability of prey (granivorous birds
   and rodents). Rock Kestrel movement into the east of the country is
   probably to exploit increases in insect abundance associated with summer
   rain. The pattern of Rock Kestrel movements suggests that it does not
   compete for food with the Lesser Kestrel F. naumanni, a Palearctic
   migrant to the east of the country.}},

   non-breeding areas is roughly the same, ca. 206 degrees. The longitude
   of the non-breeding area is dependent on the longitude of the breeding

Abstract = {{The differential migration of sex and age classes in 16 species of
   Palearctic-African migrants during their northward spring journey
   through the Central Mediterranean has been investigated from a large
   data set collected on 4 Italian islands during the `'Progetto Piccole
   Isole''. Species investigated were: European Nightjar Caprimulgus
   europaeus, Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica, Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava,
   Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, Whinchat Saxicola rubetra,
   Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, Black-eared Wheatear O. hispanica,
   Subalpine Warbler Sylvia cantillans, Whitethroat S. communis, Blackcap

   F. hypoleuca, Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus, Red-backed Shrike Lanius
   collurio, Woodchat Shrike L. senator, Ortolan Bunting Emberiza
   hortulana. The seasonal trapping patterns of males and females have been
   analysed both from the total samples and on a yearly basis. Males have
   been found passing earlier than females in 14 out of 16 cases, with
   differences reaching the level of significance in 13 out of 16 species.
   In the selected species, although the general trapping patterns may vary
   significantly among years, a temporal gap between males and females
   remains a fairly constant feature. In a sub-sample of 13 species, adults
   are found to migrate earlier than yearlings in 18 of 26 cases
   (significant differences found in 12 cases), with a slightly higher
   incidence of earlier movements of adult birds in females than males.
   This strategy seems to be another feature of spring migration, as
   confirmed by more detailed analyses referred to samples collected on
   single years and/or sites.}},

Abstract = {{Early displacement experiments and more recent experimental studies with
   hand-raised Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla are reviewed in order to
   describe our current state of understanding of the genetic basis and
   recent evolutionary changes of migratory directions in birds.
   Hand-raised Blackcaps from east and west of the Central European
   migratory divide, when tested under identical conditions, exibited
   population-specific migratory directions in orientation cages.
   Cross-breeding of birds from these two populations demonstrated an
   intermediate mode of inheritance of this behavioural character.
   New data on the mitochondrial genetic population structure of the
   Blackcap indicate that population differentiation at the behavioural
   level is not necessarily related to long periods of geographic isolation
   (e.g. during ice ages). Migratory adaptations may have evolved recently,
   in some cases rapidly, as is illustrated by the establishment of a new
   migration route of central European Blackcaps to winter quarters in the
   British Isles. This new route is shown (in a captive breeding
   experiment) to be based on a navel, genetically determined WNW migratory
   direction that must have spread from almost zero to 7-11\% frequency in
   parts of central Europe within only three decades. The inheritance of
   this novel trait also follows a phenotypically intermediate mode and is
   not influenced by the origin of the female parent (i.e. non-genetic
   factors can be excluded). The evolutionary flexibility of migratory
   adaptations is discussed in relation to changes in the environment, both
   natural and accelerated by man. The need is stressed to study the
   population-genetic mechanisms of such adaptation with the help of
   molecular markers as well as large-scale ringing on the breeding
   grounds.}},

   However, there was a tendency of these lean birds to stay for a shorter
   period in Eilat than relatively fat birds. There was also some tendency
   for lean birds to gain more mass during their stopover than fat birds.
   It seems that in spring, when less time is allotted for the whole
   migration program, the migrants resume their journey before fat reserves
   have been replenished.}},

Abstract = {{The Purple Sandpiper breeds largely in the Arctic, and winters (boreal
   season) on the rocky shores of the north Atlantic, further north than
   any other sandpiper. As the populations from Canada, Greenland, Iceland,
   Svalbard, Norway and Russia differ in wing and bill lengths it is
   possible to match measurements taken from breeding birds with samples of
   birds caught in winter. Ringing recoveries, especially from colour
   marked birds, have also helped to determine migration routes and
   wintering areas. Four populations move to the nearest ice-free coast.
   Two populations move south of the nearest ice-free coast, being replaced
   by larger birds from a more northerly population (''chain migration'').
   Only the north Canadian population is believed to migrate a long
   distance, `'leap-frogging'' other winter populations. These patterns are
   discussed in relation to theories for the migration patterns of waders.}},

Abstract = {{The return rate and fluctuations in density between years were
   determined for colour-marked populations of Grey Plover Pluvialis
   squatarola, Little Stint Calidris minuta, Curlew Sandpiper C.
   ferruginea, Sanderling C. alba and Knot C. canutus in a study in the
   Knipovich Bay area, northern Taimyr, Central Siberia (76 degrees 05'N,
   98 degrees 32'E) during three breeding seasons, June 1990 to August
   1992. No birds marked as chicks were recorded as returning to the study
   area. Females of all species exhibited low site fidelity. The return
   rate of males varied between species. No marked male Curlew Sandpiper or
   Little Stint were recorded in the season following the marking, which is
   compatible with the nomadic behaviour of these two species. In contrast,
   males of Grey Plover and Knot were site faithful and had return rates of
   78\% and 63\% respectively (though the latter value may have been
   underestimated). Site fidelity of Sanderling males lay between these
   extremes (the return rate was 20\%). The variability of bird breeding
   density in the study area was negatively correlated with return rate and
   reached the largest value in Little Stint (a factor of 18,0 between the
   lowest and highest densities) and Curlew Sandpiper (factors of 4,4 for
   males and 5,7 for females), being intermediate in Sanderling (2,5) and
   the smallest in males of Grey Plover (1,25) and Knot (1,4).
   In the late and cold season of 1992, bird densities were smallest in all
   species and the largest proportion of site faithful, but unmated, males
   of Grey Plover and Knot were recorded. Species with highly opportunistic
   and comparatively conservative territorial connections can be recognised
   among Siberian High Arctic waders. All species appear to show some
   degree of opportunism, which is probably dictated by a number of factors
   of which climate is the most important.}},

   can be observed in winter from Europe to South Africa and Australia. The
   interval between pre- and postbreeding movements of waders in Taimyr is
   short. Breeding waders, which spend from 50-70 days on the tundra have a
   arrival tight schedule, dependent mostly on weather conditions. Most
   species arrive during the first half of June, with the more northern
   areas occupied several days later than southern areas. However,
   Turnstone, Dunlin and Curlew Sandpiper arrive in the optimal part of
   their breeding ground first, and subsequently occupy sup-optimal areas
   to the north and the south. In autumn waders migrate in small groups

   of the year. Large numbers of Ruff and Bartailed Godwit concentrate in
   high arctic areas, 300-500 km north of their breeding grounds, before
   commencing southwards migration. Autumn concentrations of waders in

Abstract = {{The present publication summarizes the methodological possibilities of
   tracking radar and describes some features df nocturnal migration at two
   sites in the Negev, which include anwers to basic questions of bird
   migration. The directions of spring and autumn migration were
   practically opposite; only the headings in spring indicated some more
   compensation for stronger westerly winds. The volume df nocturnal spring
   migration was only about 65\% of autumn migration, which may be an
   indication of mortality outside the breeding area. Highest densities of
   migration at the two radar sites in the Negev Highlands (450 m above sea
   level) and in the Arava Valley (150 m below sea level) indicated
   flightlevels adjusted to atmospheric conditions aloft, and not to ground
   level. Due to the trade-wind system, the birds heading southward in
   autumn flew mainly below 1 500 m above sea level, while in spring they
   tended to make use of the anti-trades at higher altitudes. The decisive
   factor for altitude choice was the speed of tailwind in spring and
   autumn; other factors. such as temperature, humidity and pressure had no
   significant influence on the altitude distributions. With respect to the
   question of non-stop or intermittent flight across large desert areas,
   the data show that between the eastern deserts of Egypt and the
   Sinai/Negev complex the nocturnal migrants maintained their schedule of
   nocturnal flight and diurnal rest. A few exceptions of nocturnal
   migrants continuing migration at high altitudes into the day were
   identified mainly as heron- and gull-type birds. The proportion of
   waders and waterfowl identified by wing-beat pattern in nocturnal
   migration is nearly the same at both sites, indicating broad-front
   migration across the desert. The numbers of birds with continuous
   wingbeats is, however, so large compared to available estimates of
   waders and waterfowl wintering in Africa that careful reconsideration of
   the underlying assumptions in the radar and field estimates is
   necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of the western Palaearctic Populations of the Great White
   Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus stop over in Israel during their autumn
   migration. The annual average number of pelicans observed over Israel in
   autumn was 71,421+/-5,027. Although most of these birds were transient
   over Israel, increasing numbers of individuals (1130+/-303, between 1990
   and 1993) stay and winter in the northern part of Israel. The natural
   feeding sites for pelicans were diminished during recent decades due to
   human activities such as the drainage of She Hula swamp in northern
   Israel 40 years ago. However, intensive fishery and aquaculture sites
   became their favourite feeding places either during migration or in
   winter. The fish industry complained that the birds seriously affect
   fish yield. The pelicans not only cause direct damage to the fish
   industry by predation, but they also transfer nematodes to fish
   (Oreochromis sp.). As yet, there is no solution to the problem of these
   parasitic nematodes. This preliminary study revealed that the average
   daily fish consumption per individual was 0,52kg and the small sample
   size did not indicate any selection for certain fish species or size.
   Flight range estimation indicated that the pelicans, especially the weak
   individuals, need to feed during their stopover in Israel or in the
   relatively rare appropriate feeding sites along their southward
   migratory route over the desert in order to reach their wintering areas
   in eastern central Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Site fidelity and dispersal of juvenile and sexually mature adults was
   investigated at the largest southern African gannetry on Bird Island,
   Algoa Bay, where a minimum of 65 000 pairs occupy approximately 2 ha at
   a mean density of 2,85 nests per m(2). Based on 512 ring recoveries and
   live retraps of known-aged birds of this colony, immature and
   non-breeding adult gannets dispersed widely along the coasts of Africa,
   reaching Maputo Bay (southern Mozambique) on the eastern side of the
   continent and the Namibian Skeleton Coast on the western side. Very few
   birds flew farther. There were conspicuously few ring recoveries at
   400-500 km straight-line distance east from Bird Island, corresponding
   with the Pondoland coast in Transkei. A similar drop was observed in the
   west for the Tsitsikamma coast and the stretch of coast from Cape St.
   Blaize to Cape Infanta. In these regions reporting by members of the
   public is presumed to be low, either because the rocky coast is
   inaccessible or because of socio-economic reasons. The geographical
   spread of the ring recoveries suggested a possible range contraction of
   the species between the 1950's and the period 1978-1993 but the nature
   of the data prevented a test of this hypothesis. No evidence was found
   that gannets from Bird Island breed or roost at other southern African
   colonies as a matter of habit. On the contrary, all survivors of
   post-fledgling dispersal eventually returned to their native colony,
   where they exhibited pronounced fidelity to the site where they hatched
   from the egg. Based on multiple retraps of 862 known-age individuals,
   71,7\% of young adults took over vacant sites in the immediate vicinity
   of their original nest, 8,1\% moved once but were faithful to their new
   site and in 20,2\% of all cases faithfulness to the original site could
   not be shown. Moreover, in subsequent years edge birds did not vacate
   their sites to move towards the center, refuting the hypothesis that
   fringes are physically inferior breeding sites.}},

   these seabirds is examined. African Penguins Spheniscus demersus, Cape
   Gannets Morus capensis, Bank Cormorants Phalacrocorax neglectus,
   Whitebreasted Cormorants P. carbo and White Pelicans Pelecanus
   onocrotalus show strong fidelity to specific localities. Caspian Terns
   Sterna caspia change breeding localities at a low frequency; Cape
   Cormorants P. capensis, Hartlaub's Gulls Larus hartlaubii and Swift S.
   bergii and Roseate S. dougallii Terns at a higher frequency. At some
   localities, Bank Cormorants remain at the same breeding sites for
   extended periods, whereas Crowned Cormorants P. caronatus, Whitebreasted
   Cormorants, Kelp Gulls L. dominicanus, Hartlaub's Gulls, Damara Terns S,
   balaenarum, Swift Terns and Roseate Terns all alter breeding sites.
   Where space is not limiting, African Penguins may also change sites.
   Constraints on nomadism include strong attachment to traditional
   breeding localities, unwillingness to roost at non-breeding localities,
   and lack of suitable alternative nesting localities. Amongst causes of
   nomadism are excessive disturbance by humans and South African Fur Seals
   Arctocephalus pusillus and competition for breeding space, which have
   resulted in even the least nomadic of the species changing their
   breeding locations. Regularly nomadic species are likely to respond to
   environmental cues that enable them either to reduce cost of breeding or
   to increase reproductive output. Therefore, they are potentially useful
   indicators of ecological health. Nomadic breeders additionally have the
   ability to establish new breeding colonies. Some species have used

Abstract = {{Changes in hunting behaviour of a Greater Kestrel Falco rupicoloides,

   from 0-67\% per day, with a corresponding increase in strike success (to
   62\%), experience and therefore self-sufficiency. As hunting experience
   increased, so the fledgling used more difficult hunting methods, such as
   hover hunting, and captured larger and more elusive prey such as
   vertebrates. The adult female maintained a constant hunting success but
   decreased her hunting time from 7847\% per day as the fledgling became
   self-sufficient, resulting in a decrease in food provided to the
   fledgling in the last 12 days of its dependence. The male, providing
   mostly vertebrate prey, also decreased its provisioning rate but only
   over the last six days. The fledgling was estimated to be independent at
   least 26 days after fledging.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed avian diversity and abundance on islands in a 16 year old
   man-made lake in southern Africa. The vegetation was semi-arid shrubland
   and grassland. We compared species lists on islands with matched sites
   on the surrounding mainland. We recorded a total of only 19 species on
   islands, 25 on islands connected by landbridges to the mainland and 32
   species on the mainland. Islands had significantly fewer species than
   their mainland pairs but the difference was unrelated to island size.
   Three species (Fairy Flycatcher Stenostira scita, Redeyed Bulbul
   Pycnonotus nigricans, and Namaqua Dove Oena capensis) were common in
   mainland censuses but absent on islands. These species are
   insectivorous, frugivorous and granivorous respectively. Two species,
   Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus and Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, were
   more common on islands than mainland sites. Larger species and those
   with patchy mainland distributions were most prone to extinction on
   islands. This study shows that habitat fragmentation can cause rapid
   species loss, even in vagile groups such as birds. It points to the
   importance of recolonisation ability for predicting minimum viable
   areas. The persistence of species in habitat fragments may depend
   critically on corridors over which birds are willing to fly.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{14-25}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Tristan Thrush Nesocichla eremita is a little known species
   restricted to the Tristan da Cunha Islands, South Atlantic Ocean. We
   describe several aspects of the species' biology, based primarily on
   observations made at Inaccessible Island. Tristan Thrushes are
   monomorphic, assuming adult plumage after a partial juvenile moult.
   There is little sex-related size dimorphism within island populations,
   which may reflect limited genetic variation. Tristan Thrushes are
   generalist foragers, using a variety of techniques to consume both
   animal and plant matter. Breeding occurs during the austral spring, with
   a single brood raised from clutches of two eggs at Inaccessible and
   Tristan. Three-egg clutches have only been recorded at Nightingale
   Island, where they comprise about half of all clutches. Adults perform a
   very soft, melodic warbling song, which is most frequently uttered
   immediately prior to the spring breeding season. Typical calls are
   simple, high-pitched whistles.  Adults moult after the breeding season,
   and primary moult is completed within 80 days.  Moult commences at least
   one week earlier at the coast than on the plateau (elevation 250-500 m)
   at Inaccessible Island. We provide a revised population estimate for
   Inaccessible Island, and make recommendations for the species'
   conservation.}},

   pressures were generally slightly higher than ambient values and
   probably related to presence of the female in the nest. Egg temperatures
   (T(E)) were relatively constant at night (mean = 36,9-degrees-C) when
   the female incubated continuously. During the day, despite the female's
   periodic absences from the nest, egg temperature were only slightly
   lower (35,9-degrees-C) and overall egg temperature averaged
   36,4-degrees-C. Eggs lost water at a rate of 45 mg day-1, close to that
   expected for a 3,6 g egg. The nest of Cape Weavers apparently plays
   little role in the regulation of egg water loss during incubation.}},

Abstract = {{The stomach contents of 15 Karoo Korhaans were analysed. Plant material
   predominated in the diets of both sexes (80\% of stomach content mass),
   the remainder of the Contents being arthropods (12\% by mass)  and
   gastroliths. At least 32 plant taxa were eaten: species which tolerate
   or favour disturbed conditions, especially Solanaceae and Asteraceae,
   were well represented. Seeds of the alien Atriplex semi-baccata were
   common in most stomachs. Several taxa appeared at low frequency, but
   were abundant when present, indicating dietary opportunism. The
   arthropod component of the diet was dominated by insects, especially
   termites, ants and weevils. Dietary opportunism and catholicism allow
   Karoo Korhaans to retain fixed territories throughout the year in an
   unpredictable environment. Their exploitation of ephemeral plants allows
   them to thrive in areas heavily impacted on by pastoralism, where they
   may act as important seed dispersers and thus play a role in the

Abstract = {{Regurgitated food remains of the Barn Owl Tyto alba were collected
   within the rain forest of the Eastern Region of Madagascar (Andasibe and
   Manombo) and in the sub-arid thorn scrub of the Western Region (Beza
   Mahafaly). The material from Andasibe and Manombo represent single point
   samples, while 24 samples were collected from Beza Mahafaly between
   November 1990 and November 1991. A minimum of 176 individual
   vertebrates. representing 18 taxa, was identified from the Andasibe
   sample, and a minimum of 90 individual vertebrates of 5 taxa from the
   Manombo sample. The Beza Mahafaly samples included a minimum of 1013
   individual vertebrates of 22 taxa. At all three sites introduced rodents
   made up the bulk of the prey by number and by biomass, but at Beza
   Mahafaly lemurs and amphibia were also significant prey items. Insects
   constituted a small proportion of the prey. The results from these sites
   are compared with records of Barn Owl prey from mainland Africa.}},

   in high numbers throughout the year with two peaks during June-August
   and November-January. The prevalence and worm burdens of nematodes were
   independent of host age. Nematodes were more prevalent than cestodes.
   The prevalence and number of cestodes in the small intestine were
   highest during September-February and peaked during November-December.
   Levels of prevalence of cestodes were significantly higher in juvenile
   Greywing than in adults during the austral winter (May-July). The number

Abstract = {{Captive Striped Crakes showed sequential polyandry, the female laying

   Where aviary space permitted, each male set up a breeding territory and
   each female defended a larger area encompassing the territories of one
   or two males. Non-territorial subordinate males and females did not
   breed. The female initiated breeding by attracting the male and
   soliciting copulation, and the male incubated the eggs and cared for the
   young. Incubation took 17-18 days, the chicks left the nest at 4-5 days
   of age and were fully grown and capable of flight at 46-53 days.
   Breeding occurred from September to March and males normally reared two
   broods per season. Territoriality was evident only during the breeding
   season. Juvenile plumage was a duller version of the sexually dimorphic
   adult plumage; post-juvenile moult began at 13-15 weeks and was complete
   at 21 weeks. Remex moult was simultaneous and a complete moult regularly
   occurred twice a year in adults, in December and April (males) and
   September and March/April (females).}},

   August to September. The pattern of grass seed abundance closely matched
   rainfall, and breeding appears to start about one month after the start
   of the rains. An exceptionally dry spell in May and June 1990 may have

Abstract = {{Male Yellowmantled (Yellowbacked) Widowbirds Euplectes macrourus use two
   displays in territorial defense. The territory boundary display involves
   a specific, upright posture along with the hiss-trill vocalization, but
   the song does not have a visual component. Courtship displays involve
   flicking up the wings and tail, sometimes leaning toward the female with
   the tail elevated, and a slow, bouncing night display. The swiveling
   display described by Emlen (1957) was not observed, and seems to be
   replaced by the flicking displays. During the breeding season, male
   Yellowmantled Widowbirds defend territories from conspecifics but do not
   exclude Marsh Widowbirds E. hartlaubi. At night they form communal
   roosts off their territories. During the non-breeding season they form
   mixed species flocks with other finches. Male widowbirds are most active
   in display before 10h00, and often leave their territory in the
   afternoon.}},

   interactions. By such associations, these females may attain higher
   status than their individual ability would permit. We removed the
   dominant male in each group, and noted that the pair bond of the beta
   pair remained stable, and that a new male paired with the formerly
   dominant alpha female. The removal of the dominant alpha male may have
   decreased the alpha female's social status. We found no correlation
   between any morphometric variable and social status.}},

Abstract = {{Annual food requirements of a Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres family,
   comprising one nestling and two adult birds, and a breeding colony were
   estimated. A family required 226,1 kg meat during a nestling period of
   136 days, and 524,4 kg annually. The greatest family food requirements
   (average 1,98 kg/day) occurred between 60 and 100 days after hatching.
   The period between 60 and 100 days after hatching was the most critical
   period of food demands, because (a) this was the period of greatest
   nestling food requirements, (b) only one parent could be away from the
   nest at a time, and (c) daily family food intake was effectively
   constant due to temporal constraints on foraging. The estimated food
   requirements of a breeding colony comprising 152 breeding pairs and 98
   nonbreeding birds was 89 388 kg meat annually, and 36 892 kg during the
   nestling period, with the highest food requirements (302 kg/day)
   occurring during September and October. In summer rainfall areas of
   South Africa, the highest numbers of wild ungulate and livestock
   mortalities occurred during September and October. It is suggested that,
   due to physical, physiological and environmental constraints on parent
   birds' ability to provide food, the breeding cycle of Cape Vultures is
   timed so that the period of greatest food consumption coincides with the
   period of greatest food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Visits to a grassland habitat near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa
   were undertaken over a ten months (March-December) to document changes
   in avifauna, and to investigate possible reasons any changes. A total of
   72 bird species was recorded. Monthly species totals showed considerable
   fluctuation with species diversity highest in spring-early summer (n=53)

   represented (in terms of number of species) during the course of the
   study. The influence of rainfall on food availability and on vegetation
   is considered important in determining the structure of this avian
   community. Observations of the assumption (and loss) of nuptial plumage
   in euplectines showed that Longtailed Widows Euplectes progne developed
   breeding plumage earliest, and retained it for the longest period of
   time. Both Whitewinged E. albonotatus and Redcollared Widows E. ardens
   exhibited nuptial plumage for the shortest period. Displays in certain
   Cisticola species (Ayres' C. ayresii and Croaking Cisticola C.

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-24}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aerial cartwheeling flights of raptors, particularly eagles, are
   spectacular interactions in which birds lock feet and fall earthward
   while cartwheeling about a common axis. This is traditionally seen as
   courtship behaviour, despite the fact that injuries and some fatalities
   have been reported. We solicited unpublished accounts from 20 raptor
   biologists world-wide and reviewed published evidence for the courtship
   interpretation among 39 species of large and small falconiforms. In 82\%
   of 107 cases in which detailed observations were available, whirling
   flights were aggressive interactions between territorial birds and
   intruders. Cartwheeling also occurs as play behaviour and as aggression
   during parent-offspring conflicts. Cartwheeling in Fish Eagles
   Haliaeetus vocifer was confirmed as mainly intra-sexual aggression by T.
   Liversedge (pers. comm), who induced over 200 cartwheeling events in 5
   years by providing fish on territorial pairs' boundaries. Cartwheeling
   during courtship is described between presumed paired birds in three
   species of Haliaeetus eagles, and one vulture (11\% of 107). However,
   only in one report is unequivocal evidence provided that the birds were
   paired. We conclude that whirling interactions are mainly aggressive
   encounters and suggest that observer-expectant bias and other factors
   may have led to a general misinterpretation of cartwheeling as
   courtship.}},

   km) and in most territories were in old crow nests on electricity
   pylons. Birds formed 79\% of the diet (n = 58) but hunting success at
   birds was low (15\%, n = 34) except when pairs hunted in combination
   (50\%, n = 8). Pairs that fledged young raised on average 2,4 per season
   (n = 16), but after 1982 few young were fledged and by 1987 there were
   no longer any falcons breeding in the area.}},

   the opportunistic nature of quelea migration and breeding strategies.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The breeding of a marked population of African Jacanas was studied for
   eight successive years (1980-1988) on the floodplain of the Nyl River in
   the central Transvaal, South Africa. Numbers varied from 0 to c. 1000
   birds depending on the extent of flooding; individual turnover at one
   site averaged 57 \% per month. The sex ratio was significantly skewed
   towards males by about 2:1. Egglaying occurred mainly between November
   and March (85 \% of 256 records). Females were polyandrous and males
   undertook all parental care. Courtship was initiated by both sexes (72
   \% by male) and culminated in full copulation in 20\% of cases.
   Copulation lasted 35-63 sec. Sexually active birds copulated, on
   average, 0,4x/h. Nine marked females laid 7-10 clutches in one season;
   clutches were laid at 4-21 d intervals and 92\% of clutches comprised
   four eggs. The eggs in a clutch were laid on successive mornings between
   06h07-07h55. Males began incubating when the third egg was laid. The
   incubation period varied between 23-26 1/2 d; the fledging period was
   more variable, from 39 d to >75 d. Nests were frequently built up during
   incubation and eggs occasionally moved to new positions when water
   levels rose. Clutch survival was low, averaging 26 \% and ranging from
   0-39 \% between low and high flood years. Predators were suspected of
   causing 83 \%, and rising water 8 \% of clutch losses. Chick survival
   was 57-74 \%, this high survival being attributed to their predator
   avoidance behaviour. Higher female mortality is attributed to the
   handicaps in foraging and flying resulting from their much greater
   weight and less favourable wing-length:weight and foot-span: weight
   ratios than males. Aspects of copulatory behaviour are considered
   adaptive in avoiding sperm competition. Chick-carrying behaviour appears
   confined to those Jacanidae having modified radii.}},

Abstract = {{Morphometrics and the developmental stages ot plumage in captive-reared
   Greywing Francolin Francolinus africanus to 150 days of age were studied
   to determine patterns of growth and their utility in estimating age.
   There were no significant differences between sexes for body mass or
   linear body measurements for juvenile Greywing. Male spurs became
   sufficiently large (> 1 mm) for reliable sexing only after 70-77 days.
   Linear body measurements of juveniles approached adult values within 91
   days, and asymptotic values were reached at 136 days. The high amount of
   variation observed in body mass limited its use to age birds. Gompertz
   and logistic (but not von Bertalanffy) models fitted the growth data
   well. Plumage developed rapidly, with distinct natal, juvenal and
   near-adult (at 49-56 days) phases. The growth and replacement of remiges
   was sequential and similar in moult pattern and fledging to that of new
   world quails (Odontophorinae) and partridges (Perdicini). Flutter-flight
   was recorded at 14-21 days and juvenal primaries were full grown at
   77-84 days. Juvenile wing loading values were greater than adult values
   before 14-21 days, and thereafter declined below those of adult values
   until 136 days. We suggest that growth curves for the linear body
   measurements, and the replacement of primary feathers, as well as
   contour plumage moult, can be used simultaneously to estimate the age of
   young Greywing up to the age of 84-91 days, when asymptotic measurements
   are approached. For birds 84-140 days old we suggest that the primary
   moult is the most reliable estimator of age.}},

Abstract = {{The Whitefronted Plover Charadrius marginatus, a resident of the
   Alexandria dunefield, moves between the beach and dunes to feed. It
   nests in slacks, one of the many habitats in the dunefield. The main
   prey items are insects in the dunes and bivalve siphons on the beach.
   Feeding activity on the beach is determined by the time of day, tide and
   wind. At wind speeds greater than 10m.s-1 no feeding takes place in the
   intertidal zone. Below 10m.s-1 wind speed, feeding is influenced
   primarily by the time of day and secondarily by the state of the tide.
   Although feeding takes place at night, this occurs mainly during good
   light conditions. Feeding activity intensifies at dawn, irrespective of
   the state of the tide, 61\% of total feeding effort occurring on the
   beach and 39\% in the dunes.}},

Abstract = {{The Caspian Tern Sterna caspia occurs along the whole southern African
   coastline and on large river systems and water bodies away from the
   coast.  A total of 28 definite breeding localities has been recorded in
   southern Africa. Breeding has occurred recently at at least 14 coastal
   localities between Swakopmund, Namibia, and Lake St Lucia, Natal, South
   Africa.  Inland breeding has been recorded in recent years at Sua Pan,
   Botswana and Kalkfonteindam, Orange Free State, South Africa. Based on
   censuses conducted between 1980 and 1991, the southern African breeding
   population is estimated to be of the order of 500 pairs, 91\% of which
   breed coastally and 89\% breed on islands. Up to 290 pairs (58\%) bred
   at Lake St Lucia. Seventyone per cent of the 1980-1991 breeding
   population falls within eight nature reserves. Conservation of the
   Caspian Tern in southern Africa requires protection at breeding
   localities, including commercial salt and soda ash extraction works,
   against the effects of changing water levels, human disturbance and
   predation. Pesticide levels of addled and abandoned eggs should be
   measured at selected breeding localities.}},

Abstract = {{Hartlaub's Larus hartlaubii and Kelp Gulls L. dominicanus in the
   southwestern Cape feed on a wide range of prey species. On average, Kelp
   Gulls feed on larger-sized prey than do the smaller Hartlaub's Gulls .In
   an undisturbed environment the preferred foraging habitats of Hartlaub's
   and Kelp Gulls are rocky shores and open, sandy beaches (where sand
   mussels Donax serra are common) respectively. However, as a result of
   man's activities, several new foraging habitats have become available
   including croplands, fishing harbours and refuse dumps. The provision of
   supplementary food at these new foraging habitats is likely to be the
   cause of a recent population increase. Kelp Gull chicks are fed
   predominantly `'natural'' prey which indicates that the population
   increase may not be due to enhanced reproductive success, but to
   improved post-fledging survival of juveniles, which are known to
   aggregate at sites where supplementary food is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Four common calls of the Greywing Francolin Francolinus africanus are
   described acoustically, and their functions discussed. Data from 166
   crepuscular call count surveys (2 472 counts) and 540 diurnal call
   counts were analysed to investigate the temporal and meteorological
   effects on calling activity, and to assess the use of call counts as an
   index of between year and between area variation in population density.
   Calling remained at high levels from August to April during the breeding
   season.  Calling was most frequent at sunrise and sunset. Calling
   frequency and the number of calling coveys were significantly higher at
   sunrise than at sunset. Calling was concentrated in the 30 minute
   periods straddling sunrise and sunset, and peaked during the 15-minute
   periods before sunrise and before sunset.  Calling activity was
   negatively correlated with wind speed and positively correlated with
   relative humidity.  Calling was spuriously negatively correlated with
   seasonal variation in Greywing population density and strongly
   positively correlated with between year and between area variations in
   population density. We therefore suggest that call counts collected
   during March-April could be used to index annual change in the
   population density in a particular area from year to year, as well as
   within-season variation among areas.}},

Abstract = {{The response by birds to fluctuating food sources in the Knysna Forest
   was investigated during a five year period. Fruits were irregularly

   winter (June) of each year. The density and biomass of litter and soil
   surface invertebrates fluctuated both within and between years, with no
   regular seasonal peaks. Aerial invertebrates reached peak annual
   densities during summer. The total bird density within the study area
   was only correlated with fruit availability. Only a few of the
   individual bird species were correlated with the food categories but
   these correlations were not always easy to explain ecologically. It is
   concluded that irregular, and periodic low periods of food production,
   are the primary reasons for sustaining low species richness and density

   810 species had been ringed with South African Bird Ringing Unit rings
   by June 1989, resulting in 22 000 recoveries. There were more than 100
   recoveries for 27 species. The nest record card scheme of the Southern
   African Ornithological Society had 117 000 cards on file in February
   1990, representing 696 species, with more than 1 000 cards for 18
   species. There were 4 040 cards of 380 species in the moult record

   the end of 1985. A selection of published applications for each data set

   that indices for change in the demographic characteristics be developed.

   food supplements to seven pairs over two years verified sexual selection
   arguments that birds in better condition display more frequently than

   performed up to 50 U-shaped undulations in a horizontal plane, while
   sky-spiralling birds performed vertical displays, dropping in a series
   of descending U-shaped undulations, whilst twisting about their axis.
   Displaying birds stimulated others to perform and up to eight birds
   displayed in the same aerial arena. I interpret both displays as mainly
   territorial in function but provide evidence that they also have a mate
   attraction component. In form, the display resembles that of the
   Australasian Harrier C. approximans, but not that of the European Marsh
   (C. aeruginosus) nor the Reunion/Malagasy (C. a. maillardi) Harrier,

Abstract = {{More than 2 500 prey items of Subantarctic Skuas Catharacta antarctica
   were identified from regurgitated pellets collected at a roost of
   non-breeding skuas during summer 1989-90 at West Point.  Inaccessible
   Island.  Most prey items (96,5\%) were birds, primarily burrow-nesting
   procellariiforms.  Sixteen bird species were recorded in the diet, but
   five species accounted for 94,6\% of identifiable prey remains: 
   Whitebellied Storm Petrel Fregetta grallaria (53,5\%), Whitefaced Storm
   Petrel Pelagodroma marina (15,1\%), Broadbilled Prion Pachyptila vittata
   (14,0\%), Great Shearwater Puffinus gravis (7,3\%), and Common Diving
   Petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix (4,7\%).  Petrel chicks were important in
   the diet, particularly Great Shearwaters.  The main non-avian prey were
   fish and goose barnacles Lepas sp., but their importance may have been
   underestimated.  The remains of a rat Rattus sp. presumably were derived
   from the neighbouring island of Tristan da Cunha; rats are not known to
   occur on Inaccessible Island.  Prey size affected seabird availability
   to skuas, and dietary composition varied throughout the summer in
   relation to seabird breeding cycles.  Both these factors reduce the
   value of skua diet as an indicator of the relative abundances of
   burrow-nesting petrels.  There was no correlation between skua diet and
   estimates of breeding bird abundance, but this may be a consequence of
   studying non-breeding skuas.  Subantarctic Skua diet in 1989-90 was
   similar to that recorded in previous years, with consistent seasonal
   trends between years.}},

Abstract = {{Prey remains collected at or near Black Eagle Aquila verreauxii nest
   sites in the Cape Province, South Africa, were analysed according to
   frequency of occurrence of prey species in the samples.  A total of 5748
   prey individuals, collected from 73 sites, was analysed according to
   three biome groups and four nest site types.  The Rock Hyrax Procavia
   capensis is the dominant prey species, but the eagles' diet spectrum
   varies according to its availability.  Indices of species richness and
   diversity of the prey are inversely correlated with the proportion of
   the prey contributed by P. capensis, which in turn is determined by
   topography and vegetation.  Biome has a greater influence on the indices
   than has nest site type.  The age structure of the P. capensis prey
   remains closely reflects the juvenile:sub- adult:adult ratios in the
   biomes and at the nest site types.  Medium-sized (approx. 1-4,5 kg) prey
   is usually taken.  Juvenile domestic small-stock (lambs and goat kids)
   comprised only 3,4\% of the overall total.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding behaviour of Marico and Pallid Flycatchers (Melaenornis
   mariquensis and M. pallidus) was studied at the Nylsvley Nature Reserve,
   South Africa, between September 1980 and January 1981.  The flycatchers
   are morphologically similar but occur in different although sometimes
   adjacent woodlands.  The two species do not differ in their breeding
   seasons, nor in their clutch sizes.  The incubation period, previously
   unrecorded for Pallid Flycatchers, is 14 days and the fledging period 17
   days.  Marico Flycatchers fed their chicks more frequently than Pallid
   Flycatchers and helpers were observed at two Marico Flycatcher nests.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive output of Blue Waxbills Uraeginthus angolensis (BWs) and
   Melba Finches Pytilia melba (MFs) was extremely low in the central
   Transvaal, South Africa, despite strict measures to limit observer
   disturbance.  Eggs were laid in 57-61\% of nests built in 1985, and
   20-25\% of nests in 1986.  Between 0\% and 20\% of nests with eggs were
   successful, and 0-25\% of individual eggs resulted in fledged young. 
   Predation, nest desertion and storm damage accounted for most failures. 
   A substantial proportion of nests failed before they were visited,
   indicating a high rate of natural failure, and the number of nest visits
   did not appear to influence nest outcome.  Both BWs and MFs chose
   well-protected, camouflaged sites, especially in the tree Acacia
   tortilis.  However, neither dense thorns nor dense foliage, nor the
   presence of commensal wasps (Polistes and Ropalidia), safeguarded nests
   from failure.}},

Abstract = {{Ten of the 11 extant Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres colonies in the
   Transvaal were censused using aerial and/or ground census techniques in
   the 1980-1985 breeding seasons. Minimum counts were obtained and best
   estimates of total numbers of ``active nests{''} were determined using
   correction factors to compensate for incomplete photocoverage in the
   aerial technique and nest failures prior to the census dates. In 1985,
   the year when the most complete data were available, a minimum of 2741
   and a best estimate of 2987 active nests were determined to be present
   in the Transvaal. At the large colonies, which were intensively
   monitored, breeding numbers did not fluctuate greatly from year to year,
   and it is thus estimated that about 3 000 pairs of birds bred yearly in
   the Transvaal during the study period. Although the data indicate that
   the total numbers are greater than previously thought this is due to
   improved census techniques, rather than an increase in the population.
   Ninety-eight percent of breeding occurred at six colonies and 82\% at
   three (Kransberg, Blouberg and Manutsa). The large colonies are
   associated with communal grazing (homelands), private cattle and game
   farming and nature conservation areas, where the use of poison for
   predator control is minimal. The vulnerable status afforded the Cape
   Vulture in the South African Red Data Book - Birds (Brooke 1984) is
   justified because of the bird's disappearance from some breeding
   colonies, reduction in numbers at others and its vulnerability to
   poisoning.}},
