Abstract = {{American Coot (Fulica americana) behavior was observed and Water
   Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) cover measured at Lake Chapala, Mexico,
   to determine whether site selection, habitat use, behavior within
   habitat types and selection of habitats for foraging were affected by
   the invasive aquatic plant. Water Hyacinth significantly affected
   habitat choice within selected sites but not site selection by coots.
   Coots spent less time in shallow water and more time in Water Hyacinth
   as site-level hyacinth cover increased. Water Hyacinth did not restrict
   coot movement and birds foraged significantly more in patch Water
   Hyacinth (28.7 +/- 2.3\% of total time) than in open water (9.8 +/-
   0.9\%). Moreover, coots spent less time foraging in shallow water and
   more time foraging in hyacinths as cover increased. Coots used Water
   Hyacinth opportunistically and may have preferred it over other
   available habitat types. The positive relationships between Water
   Hyacinth and coots were likely attributed to the introduction of forage
   and refuge opportunities that were unavailable in Lake Chapala prior to
   Water Hyacinth invasion. Results suggest that efforts to control Water
   Hyacinth may indirectly affect the American Coot population. Received 6
   October 2009, accepted 5 June 2010.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies documented that Black Skimmers, Rynchops niger, tend to
   forage at night but did not examine which environmental variables
   explain nocturnal foraging. Foraging frequency and environmental
   variables were studied at a large breeding colony of skimmers on an
   urbanized barrier island on the west coast of Florida, USA. To determine
   which variables influenced foraging, the number of skimmers departing to
   forage was counted for 120, one-hour periods through the day and night
   from 30 May-29 August, 2007. Using generalized linear models, factors
   were most associated with skimmers departing to forage were identified.
   These models included: light level, temperature, wind, Wind direction,
   relative humidity, tide height, tide stage (incoming, outgoing, or
   slack) and status of the colony (mostly eggs, chicks, or fledglings).
   Light level was the only factor to significantly influence the amount of
   foraging (Wald = 9.40, d.f. = 1, p = 0.002). The relationship was
   negative, as light levels decreased, the number of birds departing to
   forage increased. The average proportion of the colony foraging per hour
   at night was 38.2\% (SE = 4.6) and during the day the average proportion
   was 13.6\% (SE = 4.0). The likely cause is that small, planktivorous
   fish come closer to the surface and shoreline at low light levels,
   allowing the skimmer to employ its unusual foraging technique of
   ``skimming{''}. Received 7 November 2008, accepted 27 June 2010.}},

   out of 2,421 gulls banded as chicks in the southeastern Bay of Biscay
   were analyzed. Overall, most (69.2\%) gulls were found less than 50 km
   from their natal colonies and practically all gulls (95.9\%) were found
   along the coast of northern Iberia, confirming the low mobility of this
   Yellow-legged Gull population. Distances at which gulls were found did

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) breeding in the Great
   Lakes and wintering in the southeastern United States were implanted
   with satellite transmitters to assess their movements. During 2007 and
   2008, 26 cormorants from Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada, were tracked in
   order to, variously, identify staging areas, characterize migration
   routes, winter habitat use, and home range size, assess philopatry of
   returning breeders, and test for a relationship between winter habitat
   use and arrival at the breeding ground. Females left summer areas
   earlier and spent more time in staging areas than did males. However,
   both sexes left the staging areas and arrived in the wintering grounds
   at approximately the same time. There was no difference in latitude
   between wintering males and females, or in winter residency time (n =
   136 days for both sexes). The predominant winter habitat types were
   lakes and coasts with only seven of 26 (26.9\%) birds wintering on
   aquaculture sites. Contrary to expectations, winter home ranges of birds
   on aquaculture sites ((x) over bar = 2760 km(2)) were significantly
   larger than birds on non-aquaculture sites ((x) over bar = 81 km(2)). A
   carryover effect of aquaculture was not detected; winter residency time
   was similar for birds on both aquaculture and natural winter habitats,
   with birds front both habitats returning north at the same time.
   Fidelity to the previous summer's location was observed in 15 of 20
   returning individuals. Received 8 November 2009, accepted 16 February

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To determine how habitat structural complexity, which affects prey
   vulnerability, influences foraging habitat selection by wading birds, a
   habitat use versus availability study was conducted throughout the
   Florida Everglades in 2005 and 2006. Also, art experiment was conducted
   where structural complexity was manipulated and its effect on wading
   bird foraging efficiency quantified. Among-year differences in habitat
   selection were found, which corresponded to disparate hydrological
   conditions. In 2005, a poor hydrological year in terms of the seasonal
   recession, wading birds chose foraging sites that had less emergent
   vegetation, a thicker flocculent layer and higher prey density relative
   to random sites. In 2006, an optimal hydrological year, wading bird
   foraging locations were similar to random sites in all aspects.
   Submerged vegetation did not affect wading bird site selection in either
   year. The study indicated that hydrological conditions that affect prey
   density were more important to wading bird foraging success than fine
   scale variation in habitat characteristics. However, in years of poor
   hydrology factors that affect prey vulnerability may become increasingly
   important because the penalty for choosing low quality foraging habitat
   is greater than in years of more optimal conditions. Elucidating habitat
   characteristics which create high quality foraging sites will be
   beneficial in planning wetland restoration projects and gauging future
   restoration progress. Received 2 October 2009, accepted 18 May 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Cormorants are desirable subjects for food web studies using stable
   isotopes (C and N) because of global fisheries conflicts, but no
   validated lipid-normalization procedures are currently available for any
   cormorant species. Accordingly, the effects of chloroform-methanol and
   petroleum-ether lipid extractions and three published
   lipid-normalization models on stable C and N isotope signatures in
   Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritas) muscle and liver
   tissues were investigated. The presence of lipids in cormorant muscle
   and liver decreased delta C-13 values by approximately 1-2 parts per
   thousand, more so than has been reported in other birds. Cormorants
   showed large variation in the relationship between the C:N ratio of bulk
   tissue and the change in delta C-13 values after lipid extraction,
   violating a major assumption of published lipid-normalization models.
   Despite this violation, two of the three tested models performed
   reasonably well for correcting delta C-13 values. The circumstances
   under which these models might fail are unknown, so caution is warranted
   when applying them to new species. Petroleum-ether lipid extractions did
   not reduce the C:N ratio of tissue samples to those of pure proteins
   (4.0 or below; over half of the samples ranged from 4.38 to 5.27); thus,
   lipid extraction using chloroform-methanol is recommended to ensure the
   greatest accuracy of carbon isotope analyses of cormorant tissues.

Abstract = {{Empirical studies testing the predictions of theoretical models on
   interspecific competition are scarce. The present study focused on the
   effects of competition on trophic niche by: (1) analyzing temporal
   changes in the diet of Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) on a Brazilian
   mangrove swamp before and after its breeding site was colonized by two
   congeners, Little Blue Heron (E. caerulea) and Tricolored Heron (E.
   tricolor); and (2) comparing spatial changes in the diet of the three
   egret species at the study site with six additional localities from the
   literature. Nestling boluses were analyzed in the 1993 and 1994 breeding
   seasons, when Snowy Egret was the only species ill the area, and in 1995
   and 1996, when the two other species were present. At the study site,
   although Snowy Egret consumed a greater proportion of molly fish
   (Poecilia spp.) than the two other egrets, all egrets fed mainly on
   mollies and shrimps, providing grounds for competition and trophic
   interference. However, contrary to the predictions of trade-off models,
   the Snowy Egret's trophic niche enlarged when the area was colonized by
   the other two egrets, suggesting that environmental variability is more
   relevant than competition in shaping trophic niche. The three egrets fed
   on similar resources to those found at other sites collated from the
   literature. Tricolored Heron appeared the most specialized species,
   showing a consistent, mangrove-related diet; Snowy Egret had a similar,
   but more variable diet, and Little Blue Heron showed the greatest
   trophic diversity, with a highly variable diet between sites. Overall,
   temporal and spatial variability in the trophic niches of egrets better
   match an independently-evolved pattern of resource use rather than
   predictions from competitive models of niche coevolution. Received 5
   July 2007, accepted 20 January 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Near-threatened Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa and other shorebirds
   rely on non-tidal areas during their annual migration but understanding
   of stopover ecology in these areas is lacking. Here, field observations,
   analysis of droppings and prey abundance were combined to investigate
   diet and prey-size selection by Black-tailed Godwits during fall
   migration in salinas (also called salt works or salt ponds) of southern
   Europe. Although several potential macroinvertebrate prey species were
   available and abundant, godwits positively selected the chironomid
   Chironomus satinarius. The larvae and pupae of this prey represented
   >95\% of the total number of items present in droppings during migration
   (July-September). Consumption of prey of a given size class was not
   dependent on its abundance. Thus, although larger size-classes of
   chironomid larvae were not necessarily the most abundant for some months
   (mean size of available larvae: 8.2 +/- 0.2 mm, 6.4 +/- 0.2 mm and 8.4
   +/- 0.2 mm in July, August and September, respectively), they were the
   ones most frequently consumed by the godwit (mean size of larvae
   predated: 9.9 +/- 0.8 mm, 9.2 +/- 1.7 mm, and 9.4 +/- 1.3 mm in July,
   August and September, respectively). The role salinas play as stopover
   foraging areas for godwits appears dependant not only on the abundance
   of C. salinarius but also on the abundance of large size-classes of this
   soft-bodied prey. Conservation and management of salinas that allows the
   production of high densities of chironomids during the peak of
   Black-tailed Godwit migration would assist the conservation of this
   species. Received 22 December 2009, accepted 30 April 2010.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{300-306}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Western Sandpipers and Dunlin are capable of grazing biofilm. As there
   has been no assessment of this dietary constituent in stomach contents,
   the stomachs of 89 Western Sandpipers and 56 Dunlin collected during
   breeding migration through the Fraser River delta, British Columbia,
   Canada, were examined. Invertebrates, traditionally regarded as the
   principal prey, comprised a minor fraction of mean stomach volumes
   (Dunlin: <25\%; Western Sandpiper <10\%). Three phyla accounted for most
   of these invertebrates: molluscs, annelids and arthropods. In
   comparison, sediment (a mixture of sediment particles, broken and
   unbroken diatoms plus organic detritus) comprised the major component of
   stomach volumes (Dunlin: >40\%; Western Sandpipers: >75\%). Although the
   mean volume of sediment was significantly greater in Western Sandpipers
   than Dunlin, there was no effect of sex for either species. Stomach
   sediment volume appears a convenient index of biofilm intake and
   sediment loads indicative of biofilm grazing have been reported in
   stomach contents from other shorebird species. Re-examination of
   shorebird diets appears necessary given that conditions promoting
   biofilm are not necessarily conducive for invertebrate prey. Received 6

Abstract = {{Existing hypotheses only partially explain male biased parasitism in
   mammals and birds. The present study examined whether male biased
   parasitism by a common trematode and nematode exists in breeding
   Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) from Lake Erie and if
   any sex bias in parasitism could be explained by sex differences in body
   size and foraging ecology, evaluated using stable isotope profiles
   (based on delta(13)C, delta(15)N). Male cormorants had three times the
   abundance of Drepanocephalus spathans (a trematode) than females;
   however, there were no significant sex differences in abundance or
   intensity of Contracaecum spp. Relationships between body size and
   parasitism were either non-existent or inconsistent. Stable carbon
   isotope profiles indicated that male and female cormorants that foraged
   in more pelagic habitats had more Contracaecum spp. In summary, male
   biased parasitism was present in a sample of Lake Erie cormorants and
   differences in foraging ecology might affect the levels of parasitism in
   cormorants. Received 8 October 2009, accepted 24 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{To face energetic demands of reproduction, female birds need to build up
   body reserves before breeding and/or feed while producing eggs and
   incubating. Five female Common Eiders were implanted with data loggers
   that recorded flying and diving activity for a year. The pre-laying
   period, defined as the interval between the end of spring migration and
   laying of the first egg, extended over eleven to 27 days and represented
   a period of intense foraging activity. Daily time spent diving (DTSD)
   during the pre-laying period averaged 159.6 +/- 16.0 min compared to an
   annual average of 91.4 +/- 37.8 min. Diving decreased to 69.8 +/- 7.4
   min during laying and became almost negligible at the onset of
   incubation. Females showed hyperphagic behavior during follicular
   growth, suggesting that they may directly utilize ingested food for egg
   production and laying. Given the small number of instrumented females,
   available evidence was reviewed on foraging and time of arrival in
   various populations and subspecies. Despite large variations in
   migration distance, the pre-laying period was similar to other
   populations (16-28 days), as well as DTSD (160-211 min). Reduced
   take-off capability may constrain the timing of accumulation of body
   reserves and foraging effort. Further, the level of body mass required
   for nesting (laying and incubation) was estimated to be 543 g higher
   than in winter, of which about 41-72\% would be accumulated on the
   breeding grounds. Protection of foraging areas during the pre-breeding
   period is important to maintain healthy populations. Received 2 March
   2009, accepted 19 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Rice fields in southwestern Louisiana provide breeding habitat for
   several waterbird species; however, little is known about nest density,
   nest survival and the importance of landscape context of rice fields in
   determining breeding activity. In 2004, 42 rice fields were searched for
   nests, and 40 were searched in 2005. Land uses surrounding rice fields,
   including irrigation canals, trees, crawfish ponds, rice, fallow and
   soybean fields, were examined to determine influence on nest density and
   survival. Nest densities were 13.5-16.0 nests/km(2) for Purple
   Gallinules (Porphyrio ``martinica), 3.0-13.7 nests/km(2) for Fulvous
   Whistling Ducks (Dendrocygna bicolor), 2.6-2.8 nests/km(2) for Common
   Moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), 0.3-0.92 nests/km(2) for Least Bitterns
   (Ixobrychus exilisi) and 0-0.6 nests/km(2) for Mottled Ducks (Anas
   fulvigula). Nest survival was 52-79\% for Purple Gallinules and 39-43\%
   for Fulvous Whistling Ducks. Apparent nest success of Common Moorhens
   was 73-75\%, 83\% for Least Bitterns and 33\% for Mottled Ducks. Purple
   Gallinule and Common Moorhen nest densities were highest in fields with
   a larger proportion of irrigation canals surrounding rice fields. Purple
   Gallinule nest densities were greater in fields devoid of trees and
   landscapes dominated by rice fields and pasture, rather than landscapes
   containing soybean fields and residential areas. Fulvous Whistling Duck
   nest densities were higher in agriculturally-dominated landscapes with
   few trees. Received 17 June 2009, accepted 29 May 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Movements of adult Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)
   tending broods were examined in coastal northern California. Chicks
   moved an average of 518 +/- 52 m from their nests one to three days
   after hatch; thereafter, movements decreased. In their first ten clays,
   there was no difference in distances moved or home range size between
   chicks that eventually fledged and those that died. Plovers consistently
   used the same areas of the beach each year, and these areas were
   positively associated with nest locations and negatively correlated with
   human activity. A fenced refuge for breeding plovers was created in the
   area most used by humans. Fledging success doubled in the refuge during
   the five years it was protected (37\% chicks survived), compared to
   three years when the area lacked protection (15\% chicks survived).

Abstract = {{Trumpeter Swan nesting in Yellowstone was monitored from 1987-2007 to
   assess the effects of environmental conditions, density-dependent
   factors and habitat characteristics on two metrics of productivity:
   clutch size and fledging success. Average clutch size was 4.2 eggs per
   nest (range = 3-6, SE = 0.2) and a positive relationship was found
   between clutch size and area of wetland complex surrounding the nesting
   site. The probability of fledging success (survival until September of
   at least one cygnet per nest) was associated with an increasing metric
   of territory quality (measured as historical site use from 1931-1986)
   and decreasing April precipitation. The probability of fledging success
   was estimated to range from 0.062 (95\% CI = 0.060, 0.064) for a nest
   located in a wetland occupied only one time historically to 0.275 (95\%
   CI = 0.073, 0.466) in a wetland occupied 38 times historically. The need
   to protect and maintain high quality nesting areas is underscored by the
   variability among nesting territories. The importance of adult survival
   is highlighted by the low productivity of Yellowstone Trumpeter Swans
   because pairs likely need to survive and nest many times to replace
   themselves. Received 6 March 2009, accepted 5 June 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Mallard (Anus platyrhynchos) populations in the Lower Mississippi
   Alluvial Valley (hereafter, LMAV) comprise the largest concentration of
   wintering Mallards in North America. Radiotelemetry techniques were
   employed to assess movements by female Mallards during winters of
   2004-2005 and 2005-2006; 467 paired (diurnal and nocturnal) observations
   on 80 radiomarked females were attained to assess effects of date,
   female age, hunting regime and habitat type on distances moved and
   potential habitat switching. Distance moved increased with date for
   females diurnally located in RICE but decreased for females in FOREST.
   Median movement distance was 1.5 km, suggesting suitable habitats for
   all activities were in close proximity. Habitat switching varied among
   diurnal habitat types used by females. Females diurnally located in
   FOREST and REFOR switched habitats in <= 22\% of paired observations,
   whereas females diurnally located in RICE switched habitats in 55\% of
   paired observations. The decreased movement distances and less frequent
   habitat switching by females using forested habitats should reduce their
   energy expenditure and exposure to predation risk. The results document
   the importance of forested wet-lands to Mallards wintering in the LMAV
   and provide support for programs that protect and restore such habitats.

Abstract = {{Southward migrating Red Knots (Calidris carnal's) were surveyed on Cape
   Cod, Massachusetts. Unique markers, including ones applied to birds in
   wintering areas in North and South America, were found. Northern and
   southern-marked knots had different migration chronologies, plumage
   characteristics and flight feather molt. Knots from the two groups were
   found to have different foods and foraging habitats. Numbers of knots
   more than one year old were found to increase from mid-July to
   mid-August, decline during late August and then increase in
   September-October. As numbers declined in August, the proportion of
   knots from South America decreased and, by I September, all remaining
   marked birds had been tagged in North America. Average minimum stopover
   durations were found to vary according to original banding locations,
   e.g. 8.5 (+/- 2.6) days for South America, 14.2 (+/- 3.2) clays for
   Delaware Bay, 16.1 (+/- 3.5) days for the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast and
   49.5 (+/- 24.6) days for Florida. The proportion of knots with alternate
   plumage was higher in July-August than in September and by mid-October
   almost all had basic plumage. Also, low numbers (tens) of basic-plumaged
   knots-probably one-year-old subadults were found during July-August;
   most had active flight feather molt. First-arriving juvenile knots were
   seen beginning in the third week of August and their numbers peaked in
   mid-September. Differential uses of foraging and roosting habitats were
   found to be related to migration destinations. Vital habitats that
   should be managed for protection of threatened Red Knots at this key
   southward migration stopover area were identified. Received 17 September
   2009, accepted 31 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) and the Pied-billed Grebe
   (Podilymbus podiceps) are secretive marsh bird species that breed in the
   Illinois and Upper Mississippi River Valleys. Marsh bird surveys were
   conducted on public and private wetlands in this region during the
   breeding seasons of 2006 and 2007. Detection probability ((rho) over
   cap) and site occupancy probability ((psi) over cap) were estimated for
   each species separately for each year. Candidate models including
   sampling and habitat covariates were compared using AIC(c), to determine
   what variables had the greatest influence on (rho) over cap and (psi)
   over cap. Average 0 for Least Bitterns was 0.29 in 2006 and 0.18 in
   2007, and varied throughout the 2007 survey season. Average (rho) over
   cap for Pied-billed Grebes was 0.44 in 2006 and 0.22 in 2007, and an
   observer effect was found in 2007. Overall (psi) over cap for Least
   Bitterns was 0.17 in 2006 and 0.14 in 2007. Least Bittern occupancy was
   positively related to tall emergent vegetation cover in both years and
   to water-vegetation interspersion in 2007, and was negatively related to
   woody vegetation cover in 2007. Overall (psi) over cap for Pied-billed
   Grebes was 0.21 in 2006 and 0.31 in 2007. Pied-billed Grebe occupancy
   was negatively related to woody vegetation cover in both years, and was
   positively related to areas of open water in 2006. Land managers
   targeting these species should provide wetlands free from woody
   vegetation with extensive areas of open water for Pied-billed Grebes,
   and tall emergent vegetation interspersed with small pools of water for
   Least Bitterns. Received 8 May 2009, accepted 23 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable and effective technique for capturing rails would improve
   researchers' ability to study these secretive marsh birds. The time
   effectiveness and capture success of four methods for capturing rails in
   emergent marsh and agricultural wetlands in southern Louisiana and Texas
   were evaluated during winter and breeding seasons. Methods were hand and
   net capture from an airboat at night, an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) at
   night, an ATV during daylight rice harvest and passive capture using
   drop-door traps with drift fencing. Five hundred and twenty rails were
   captured (and 21 recaptures): 192 King Rails (Rallus elegans), 74
   Clapper Rails (R. longirostris), 110 Virginia Rails (R. limicola), 125
   Sora (Porzana carolina) and 40 Yellow Rails (Coturnicops
   noveboracensis). Methods used at night were effective at capturing
   rails: capture from airboats yielded 2.13 rails per hour each airboat
   was operated and capture from ATVs yielded 1.80 rails per hour each ATV
   was operated. During daylight, captures from ATVs during rice harvest
   (0.25 rails per hour each ATV was operated) and passive drop-door traps
   with drift fencing (0.0054 rails per trap hour) were both inefficient.

Abstract = {{Open marsh water management (OMWM), a method of mosquito reduction
   through habitat alteration, is widely practiced in Mid-Atlantic salt
   marshes. The effect of these habitat modifications on obligate salt
   marsh breeding birds is poorly understood. The present study was
   conducted to quantify the extent of OMWM and determine if the technique
   affected Seaside Sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) reproductive success and
   nesting ecology. Seaside Sparrow territory density, nest density, nest
   survival, productivity and vegetation cover was estimated on 19 plots
   (1-3 ha) within tidal marshes in Sussex County, Delaware in May-August
   2006-2007. Plots were characterized as limited (N = 10) or extensive
   OMWM (N = 9) based on the amount of alterations and time since
   manipulations. Seaside Sparrow territory density and nest density were
   two times greater on limited OMWM plots than extensive OMWM plots. Also,
   the number of Seaside Sparrow eggs/ha and fledglings/ha were greater on
   limited OMWM plots. Seaside Sparrow nest survival rates did not differ
   between limited and extensive OMWM plots, but reproductive output (\#
   nests/ha, eggs/ha, and fledglings/ha) was greater on areas with limited
   OMWM. OMWM may be an alternative means of mosquito control but should
   not be considered a method of habitat enhancement for Seaside Sparrows
   and possibly other obligate salt marsh bird species. Received 16 June

Abstract = {{Loss and modification of tidal marsh habitat has contributed to the
   decline of marsh bird species. For many marsh birds that inhabit tidal
   ecosystems, little information exists on habitat use, particularly in
   relation to movement and response to prey availability. In this study,
   radio-telemetry was used to investigate home range size, movement
   patterns and response of Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris) to prey
   availability within tidal marshes in coastal Mississippi. Mean fixed
   kernel 95\% home range for breeding Clapper Rails was 1.37 ha +/- SE
   0.27 (N = 10 birds) with a 50\% core use area 0.32 ha +/- SE 0.07 (N =
   10 birds), which arc estimates similar to those obtained throughout this
   species' range. The extent of Clapper Rail movements during the
   incubation period was negatively correlated with density of fiddler crab
   burrows within 50 m of nest sites. Clapper Rails' use of marsh edge
   decreased relative to tidal height. Use of this habitat type may have
   been further restricted during the first few weeks of the parental-care
   period when adults were caring for recently fledged young. Collectively
   these results illustrate the importance of edge and interior marsh
   habitats and may provide an explanation for the variation in Clapper
   Rail densities found within and between tidal marsh systems. Received 15
   June 2009, accepted 23 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring programs aimed at understanding the population trends of
   secretive marshbirds can be altered to benefit from the creative
   interplay between predictions, designs and models, and provide the
   template for doing so. Effective application of information to decision
   making typically requires integration of several types of information in
   a common framework, including ``found{''} data and retrospective
   studies, innovative sampling designs and the use of hierarchical data
   structures. Hierarchical and state-space modeling provide a unified
   modeling structure for such designs and data. These ideas are
   illustrated with the problem of investigating and mitigating the effects
   of climate change on secretive marshbirds in coastal North America. How
   both ecological theory and available data can be used to provide
   predictions about the impacts of regional and local climate changes on
   these avian communities are illustrated. Received 12 November 2009,

Abstract = {{A small, isolated population of Common Terns (10-30 pairs) has bred at
   Bermuda since at least the 1920s. In September 2003, a hurricane
   eliminated all the adult males; only females returned in 2004 and these
   paired together and laid clutches of three-seven infertile eggs. The
   breeding population was re-established in 200506 by four adult males
   that had been too young to breed in 2003-04. These males paired with
   females that were probably young and bred with high success (mean 2.6
   fledged chicks/pair) through 2009. Two males apparently each mated with
   two females to form productive trios. The old females continued to pair
   together and lay infertile eggs, even though males were raising chicks
   on the same islets. Consequently, the effective population size at the
   `bottleneck' was only four males and four females. Although the
   population is now increasing rapidly, it remains critically endangered.

   in Dovekie nests although incubation of both eggs has not previously
   been documented. Here, the incubation of a two-egg clutch by both
   members of a pair over an extended period is described and the origin of
   the eggs plus value of the observation discussed. Received 26 October

Abstract = {{A feather-loss disorder, first observed in captive African Penguin
   (Spheniscus demersus) chicks in a South African rehabilitation center in
   2006, was found one year later in wild Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus
   magellanicus) chicks in four colonies in Argentina. Two years later, it
   was found in African Penguin chick; in the wild. The featherless African
   Penguin chicks in the rehabilitation center (N = 176) lost their down
   and emerging juvenile feathers, remaining featherless for several weeks
   until they died (N = 31) or grew juvenile (N = 3) or adult plumage (N =
   145) before being released. The featherless African Penguin chicks took
   16 days longer to reach the rehabilitation center's standards for
   release than feathered chicks (t(176) = -8.8, P < 0.00001). Likewise,
   the featherless wild Magellanic Penguin chicks (N = 13) lost their
   second coat of down, remaining featherless for several weeks; but those
   that survived to fledging all grew normal juvenile plumage (N = 4).
   Featherless Magellanic Penguin chicks grew more slowly and were smaller
   at fledgling age than most feathered chicks. The disorder in Africa and
   Argentina is new, rare, and more common in a rehabilitation center in
   Africa than in the wild. The cause of the feather loss is unknown, but
   the disorder results in slower growth, smaller fledglings, and appears
   to increase mortality in Magellanic Penguin chicks in the wild. Received
   21 January 2009, accepted 31 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Abundance indices of Black Scoters (Melanitta nigra americana) breeding
   in Alaska indicate a long-term population decline without obvious
   cause(s). However, few life history data are available for the species
   in North America. In 2001-2004, information was collected on nesting
   habitat and reproductive parameters (i.e. components of productivity)
   from a population of Black Scoters nesting on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,
   Alaska. A total of 157 nests were found over four years. Primarily,
   nests were among dense vegetation in shrub edge habitat, predominantly
   dwarf birch ( Betula glandulosa) and Alaska spiraea (Spiraea
   beauverdiana), an average of 58 in from water. Females initiated nests
   from 11 June and 17 July across years. Clutch size averaged 7.5 eggs and
   did not vary annually. Nest success was highly variable among years and
   ranged from 0.01 to 0.37. Duckling survival to 30 days old varied among
   years, and ranged from 0.09-0.35. Nest success was poor in three of four
   years, likely due to predation by Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes). Black Scoters
   appear to have low but variable productivity, consistent with
   life-history Patterns of other sea duck species. Information gained will
   direct future demographic research on Black Scoters, and highlights
   knowledge gaps impeding management strategies needed for population
   recovery. Received 10 June 2009, accepted 17 December 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) occupancy surveys were conducted in
   the Arkansas Delta, USA, during April-July 2005-2006 to determine the
   proportion of area occupied and relate occupancy to habitat
   characteristics. Previous large-scale surveys indicated few Least
   Bitterns were present in the Delta. During surveys at 190 sites, Least
   Bitterns were detected at 15 sites in 2005 and at 16 sites in 2006.
   Several candidate models were tested to explain occupancy based on
   habitat variables. Emergent vegetation cover was positively related to
   occupancy while the proportion of forest within 400 m of a survey site
   was negatively related to occupancy. The study suggests that managing
   the breeding habitat of Least Bitterns for emergent vegetation cover and
   controlling forest cover near occupied sites may contribute to this
   species' recovery throughout its range. Received 2 June 2009, accepted 4
   September 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus) populations have declined
   during the past 150 years in part due to destruction and fragmentation
   of grasslands used during the breeding season. Here, multiscale habitat
   characteristics best predicting number of Long-billed Curlews, detected
   during range-wide surveys conducted throughout the United States in 2004
   and 2005, were determined. Long-billed Curlews were most often observed
   in habitats classified primarily as grassland habitat and secondarily as
   shortgrass or pasture/rangeland, all with low vegetation heights (i.e.
   4-15 cm). Numbers of Long-billed Curlews were positively associated with
   wetland habitats on a local scale and hay/pasture areas on a landscape
   scale, but negatively associated with shrub/scrub on local and landscape
   scales and evergreen forests on a landscape scale. The study confirmed
   the importance of grassland, cropland, pasture and wetland habitats for
   breeding Long-billed Curlews across its geographic range in the United
   States. These results reinforce the need to conserve, manage, or create
   contiguous tracts of grasslands containing emergent wetlands for
   Long-billed Curlews throughout the breeding season anti their range in
   the United States. Received 10 August 2009, accepted 29 November 2009.}},

Abstract = {{In Japan, the habitat range of Long-billed Plovers (Charadrius
   placidus), a typical river-nesting species, has contracted by 17\% over
   the past 20 years. In the Tama River, Kanto region, the Tama River
   Research Group created a gravel bar in 2001 and 2002 by removing an
   invasive and non-native woody plant, Black Locust (Robinia
   pseudoacacia), to restore the biodiversity of the river ecosystem. The
   study investigated the effect of the gravel bar creation on Long-billed
   Plovers and their nest-site preference during the breeding seasons in
   2001-2004 and 2006. After gravel bar creation, the mean number ( SE) of
   observed Long-billed Plovers increased from 0.4 (+/- 0.19) to 11.0 (+/-
   1.54), which indicates that artificially constructed habitats have a
   potential to restore populations of Long-billed Plovers. The hatching
   rates in the study site varied greatly (19\% to 100\%) from year to
   year, and comparison with earlier studies was difficult due to
   incomplete information about the breeding conditions and differences in
   survey methods. Nesting probability was affected negatively by gravel
   size and positively by distances from forest edges, even after
   considering spatial auto-correlation caused as a result of having
   continuous sampling grids. Received 9 March 2009, accepted 24 December

Abstract = {{Although egg predation from aerial predators is one of the most
   important threats to ground-nesting seabirds, few populations conceal
   their nests under vegetation. However, little is known about the
   relationships between nesting habitat characteristics, nest densities
   and egg predation. Dry Tortugas (DRTO) Sooty Terns (Onychoprion fuscata)
   nest on sandy substrate. However, a substantial shift in the onset of
   their breeding season has increased their exposure to aerial predators,
   which, in turn, may have triggered a change in nesting behavior. A
   Bayesian model was developed to determine the relationship between
   vegetation cover and nest numbers, and whether such a relationship has
   reduced the incidence of egg predation. Over eight years, data on the
   number of nests, incidents of egg predation and on vegetation cover were
   collected from 132 survey plots. A clear non-linear relationship between
   vegetation cover and nesting numbers was found: thresholds of 65\% cover
   of woody vegetation, such as shrubs, and of less than 13\% of forbs,
   were shown to maximize the number of nests, and to significantly reduce
   egg predation. These results have implications for nesting habitat
   management and demonstrate that Sooty Terns are capable of changing
   their breeding behavior in response to an increase in the risk of egg
   predation. Received 7 May 2009, accepted 21 December 2009.}},

   Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla: Adaptation or Food Shortage?}},

Abstract = {{Body masses of over 1,500 adult and sub-adult Black-legged Kittiwakes
   Rissa tridactyla were measured during breeding seasons from 1954 to 1995
   at colonies in NE England. There was little change between years in the
   mean mass of each sex, except for a 2\% increase in the 1980s and a
   decrease of 4-7\% in 1995. The relative constancy of mass, together with
   high breeding success throughout, suggested that periods of food
   shortage in the breeding season were absent throughout the study period.
   Breeding males averaged 394g and were about 13\% heavier than females
   (340g). Breeding fen tales showed a brief and temporary increase in mass
   prior to egg laying, and both sexes showed a small but non-significant
   increase in mass during incubation. There was an abrupt loss of about
   6\% of mass in adults of both sexes al. the time the eggs hatched, and
   mass remained at this lower level through the nestling period. Masses of
   prospecting and breeding females were similar and both showed the abrupt
   decrease in mass in late May and in June. In contrast, prospecting males
   had a consistently lower mass (377g) than breeding males throughout. The
   pattern and timing of the loss of mass in breeding kittiwakes did not
   support the hypothesis that it is induced by stress arising from the
   need to obtain extra food for the brood, but that it can be regarded as
   an adaptation for more energetically efficient flight during a period
   when increased flying activity is needed to obtain additional food for
   the brood. The assumption that a higher mass in an individual is always
   a useful measure of quality is probably unjustified. Received 22 July
   2009, accepted 30 September 2009.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Fossil evidence indicates that diverse and abundant seabird communities
   were once found in the main Hawaiian Islands. However, these seabird
   populations have severely decreased, or even disappeared, as a result of
   human disturbance, habitat loss and predation from introduced mammals.
   Today, the vast majority of Hawaii's seabirds nest on low-lying and
   uninhabited atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian islands, some of which
   will not be able to withstand projected sea-level rises. As a result,
   populations of many seabird species will be further reduced unless
   suitable nesting habitat in the main Hawaiian Islands can be restored
   against predators. The history of seabird management in the Hawaiian
   Islands is examined, tracing three overlapping stages. The first
   emphasized exploitation the second recognized the damage done by humans
   and developed methods to remove the causes. The third and current stage
   focuses on restoration, initially of seabirds, and most recently of
   ecosystems. Restoration will require a scientific approach and
   documentation of successes and failures, improving the chances of
   success for future interventions. Received 17 September 2009, accepted

Abstract = {{Flightless and post-molt survival and movements were studied during
   August-May, 2001-2002, 20022003 and 2006-2007 for 181 adult female
   Mallards (Anus platyrhynchos). Birds were radiotagged just before or
   early in their flightless period on four wetlands that differed in size
   on Klamath Basin (KB) National Wildlife Refuge complex. Flightless
   survival varied among years but was higher on two larger than two
   smaller wetlands; 30-day survival ranged from 11\% (SE = 6.5\%) on a
   small wetland in 2006 to 93\% (SE = 6.5\%) on a large wetland in 2001,
   and averaged 76.8\% (SE = 6.1\%). Most flightless mortality was from
   avian botulism (64\%) and predation (26\%). Of the 81 radiotagged
   Mallards that did not die in KB, 80\% moved to the Central Valley of
   California (CVCA) before 31 January, 16\% wintered in unknown areas, and
   4\% remained in KB through 31 January. Mallards departed KB 21 August-13
   January (average: 11 Nov 2001, 25 Oct 2002, 19 Nov 2006). Post-molt
   survival during August-March in KB (20.7\%, SE = 6.3\%) was lower than
   in CVCA during this (62.9\%, SE = 10.1\%) and an earlier study. Survival
   in KB was consistently high only for females that molted in large
   permanent marshes, and although the impact of poor survival of molting
   females on Mallard population dynamics is unknown, KB water management
   plans should be developed that maintain these habitats. Received 17
   September 2009, accepted 21 February 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have investigated the use of aquaculture-produced foods by
   piscivorous birds. American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos)
   were collected from four locations (two aquaculture, one riverine and
   one coastal) in the southeastern United States during winter and spring
   1998-1999 to assess the contribution (biomass, frequency of occurrence)
   of aquaculture-produced foods and their effect on body condition.
   Pelican diets reflected opportunistic foraging across locations. Diet
   near catfish ponds consisted mostly of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus
   punctalus). Diets along the Mississippi River had similarly high biomass
   of catfish, but otolith counts suggested lower use of catfish. Diets
   near crawfish (Procambarus spp.) ponds included shad (Dorsomis spp.),
   crawfish and sunfish (Lepomis spp.); whereas diets from coastal
   Louisiana were predominantly salt water fish. Pelican body condition, as
   indexed by percent ()mental fat, was similar between seasons but higher
   at catfish ponds. Foraging at crawfish ponds did not improve body
   condition over foraging in natural conditions. The superabundant, large
   and vulnerable food source (i.e. catfish in aquaculture ponds) likely
   resulted in reduced energy expenditures by pelicans, which would improve
   body condition. Higher fat reserves could facilitate spring migration
   and reproductive success. American White Pelican use of catfish at
   aquaculture facilities is predicted to continue and likely increase.

Abstract = {{The Torrent Duck (Merganetta armata) is a little-known species that
   feeds on benthic invertebrates in fast-flowing mountain rivers and
   streams from Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego. In Argentina the species is
   classified as Threatened but basic studies of its resource requirements
   are necessary for conservation. Prey selection by adult Torrent Ducks
   was investigated by comparing the proportion of prey species in duck
   faeces with the proportion available in the benthos. Faeces and benthos
   were sampled seasonally over one year, from four territories in the
   Manso River Basin, Nahuel Huapi National Park, northwestern Argentine
   Patagonia. Filter feeding Simuliidae larvae (Diptera, 41-76\% number of
   total prey) were consumed in greater proportion than their abundance. In
   Arroyo Blanco, an oligotrophic stream, Simuliidae were absent and the
   most important prey were Gripopterygidae larvae (Plecoptera, 53\%) and
   Blephariceridae larvae (Diptera, 23\%). Simuliidae may be easy prey
   because, like other filter feeders, they feed in exposed places.
   However, where these filtering species are rare or absent (as in Arroyo
   Blanco), ducks consume other prey. The results show that Torrent Ducks
   exhibit a versatile feeding behavior, indicating that the species can
   adjust to changes in the benthos without disappearing in a given
   environment. Received 4 May 2009, accepted 31 August 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The Eskimo Curlew (Numenius borealis), now near extinction, was
   intensively hunted during fall migration along the Atlantic coast from
   Labrador to Long Island through the late 195 century. Scores of
   post-1850 records from this region have been gleaned from the literature
   but the rate of population decline has never been assessed. George H.
   MacKay's shooting journal, which has been largely overlooked, includes
   quantitative data on curlew abundance trends from 1875 to 1897 on
   Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. MacKay observed 650 curlews and his
   party bagged 87 during 231 hunting days logged during the flight period
   (21 August-2 October) over 22 hunting seasons. The last major flights
   were observed in 1881. Although he continued to hunt enthusiastically
   through the early 1890s, annual totals of curlews observed by MacKay
   declined significantly (r(s) = 0.40, p <0.05) from 1875 to 1897, as did
   annual bag totals (r(s) = -0.41, p <0.05). Annual bag totals of American
   Golden Plovers (Pluvialis dominica), which often associated with Eskimo
   Curlews, also declined precipitously during the period (r(s) = 0.51, p <
   0.01). Journal entries suggest that MacKay abandoned shorebird hunting
   after a string of disappointing seasons in the 1890s. MacKay's journal
   offers a unique historical perspective on the decline of the Eskimo
   Curlew, a species about which little additional historical information
   is likely to be learned. Received 26 August 2009, accepted 2 January
   2010.}},

Abstract = {{Bridled Terns (Sterna anaethetus) have only recently been discovered
   breeding in New Caledonia, the previous nearest breeding colonies being
   in Eastern Australia. Bridled Tern breeding biology was investigated in
   a single, small (c. 100 pairs) colony during the 2003 and 2004 breeding
   seasons. Of 93 nests monitored, 82 were tinder cover (70 under rock and
   twelve under vegetation). Nesting location did not predict hatching
   success. Almost half (49\%) of the 37 nests monitored in 2003 were
   reused in 2004. Egg-laying took place between late October and
   mid-January; egg volumes did not vary between the two breeding seasons.
   Chicks reached their asymptotic weight (132 g) at 37 d, faster than
   chicks in Australia (40-53 d). Wing length was the most reliable
   predictor of chick age. An equation based on density was generated to
   age eggs, and graphs to age chicks. An estimated 81\% of clutches
   produced fledglings. Predation of tern nests by Silver Gull (Larus
   novaehollandiae) was not observed, but Peregrine Falcons (Falco
   peregrinus) were observed hunting and catching adult terns. Received 12

Abstract = {{Recent reports have suggested that hybridization occurs between
   Blue-footed (Side nebouxii) and Peruvian (Sub a variegate) Boobies in
   northern Peru, but none included morphometric or genetic analyses of
   apparent hybrids. Over three field seasons, morphological measurements
   and blood samples were taken from four apparent Peruvian x Blue-footed
   Booby hybrids on Lobos de Tierra Island, and one apparent hybrid on the
   Lobos de Afuera islands. Feather samples were collected from one
   representative of each parental species and one hybrid. Morphological
   variation of apparent male hybrids was compared to 25 male Peruvian
   Boobies and 140 male Blue-footed Boobies, and variation in 540 base
   pairs of the mitochondrial control region and 8 microsatellite loci for
   all hybrids was compared to 141 Peruviar Boobies and 168 Blue-footed
   Boobies. Molecular sexing indicated that four hybrids were male and one
   was female. Male hybrid boobies showed weak transgressive segregation,
   all hybrids possessed Peruvian Booby mitochondrial DNA and
   microsatellite alleles from each parental species. Hybridization between
   these species appears rare and restricted to the islands where both
   species breed, and pre and post-mating barriers appear well established.

Abstract = {{Many animals of the Galapagos Islands are known for unusual foraging
   behaviors, often feeding in a way not typical for the taxon in question.
   In 2003, an adult Lava Heron (Butorides striate sundevalli) was observed
   feeding on an adult Small Ground Finch (Geospiza fuliginosa). The
   endemic Lava Heron had not been previously observed feeding on these
   finches that are common throughout the islands. The behavior could
   represent a valuable feeding strategy for herons in a situation where
   aquatic food resources are temporally unpredictable, as well as an
   additional mortality risk for Galapagos Finches. Received 18 July 2009,
   accepted 5 October 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Knock-down tags are often used to monitor population and nest attendance
   patterns of burrow-nesting seabirds. However, the accuracy of the
   knock-down method has not been considered in detail. Here, measurements
   of nest attendance patterns for Ancient Murrelets (Synthliboramphus
   antiquus) obtained by the knock-down and the radio telemetry methods
   were compared on a colony at Reef Island, Haida Gwaii, Canada. Radio
   transmitters and knock-down tags both indicated activity 79\% of the
   time (range: 61-96\%, N = 307), and the correlation between the two
   methods was significant. Hence, knock-down tags provide information
   that, although coarse, can provide an adequate indication of
   reproductive behavior in Ancient Murrelets without disturbance to the
   bird. Received 27 April 2009, accepted 26 September 2009.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To test the effectiveness of patagial marking with cattle ear-tags for
   Australian White Ibis (Threskiornis molucca), 105 adults and 58
   nestlings were fitted with tags on each wing. Resighting frequency of
   adults, survival of nestlings, breeding behavior and foraging movements
   were monitored. The resighting frequency of wing-tagged adults was
   compared with resightings of 160 adults marked with colored leg-bands.
   Survival rates of wing-tagged nestlings were compared with an equal
   sample of 58 nestlings fitted with colored leg-bands. Over six months,
   96\% of tagged adults were resighted and there was no indication of
   impaired flight, with foraging movements ranging up to 30 km.
   Wing-tagged adults were more likely (40\%) than color-banded adults
   (28\%) to be detected in a one-off survey three months after marking and
   65\% of tagged birds were observed nesting. Higher mortality was
   observed among smaller nestlings (<1100 g) compared with larger
   nestlings marked with wing tags, but not among those marked with leg
   bands. Inspection of the wings of two adult and two juvenile birds
   recaptured 6-8 months after marking indicated only minor feather
   abrasion, although further study is needed to assess long-term impacts.
   Because patagially-fitted cattle ear-tags are more visible than colored
   leg bands, can be fitted quickly with minimal trauma, and seem to have
   few adverse effects, they appear to be an effective technique for
   individually marking large adult birds. Received 1, July 2009, accepted

Abstract = {{Female Northern Pintails (Anus acuta) were sampled in California s three
   main Central Valley wintering regions (Sacramento Valley Suisun Marsh
   San Joaquin Valley) during September October before most regional
   movements occur and microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA were analyzed
   to examine population structure and relatedness Despite reportedly high
   rates of early fall pairing and regional fidelity both sets of markers
   indicated that there was little overall genetic structuring by region
   Pintails from Suisun Marsh did exhibit high er relatedness among
   individuals and capture groups than in the Sacramento or San Joaquin
   Valleys likely reflecting a sample comprised of a greater proportion of
   local breeders The lack of genetic structuring among regions indicates
   that a high degree of movement and interchange occurs among pintails
   wintering in the Central Valley Thus although maintaining the existing
   distribution of pintails among Central Valley regions is important for
   other reasons It does not appear to be critical to retain current
   patterns of population genetic variation Because of potential lack of
   independence among highly related study individuals researchers should
   consider regional differences in relatedness when designing sampling

Abstract = {{In 1993 a mark recapture effort was initiated to band annually all Great
   Lakes Piping Plover nesting adults and offspring With voluntary
   reporting by observers >430 sightings of 154 individually marked Great
   Lakes banded birds were documented on the wintering grounds during 1995
   2005 This paper reports non breeding distribution and site fidelity and
   identifies Critical Habitat units used by this population during the
   winter Information obtained through banded bird sightings indicates that
   the winter range of Great Lakes Piping Plovers extends from North
   Carolina to Texas and the Bahamas with the majority (75\%) of reported
   individuals wintering in Georgria and Florida About 95\% of sightings
   were near or within federally designated winter Critical Habitat for
   Piping Plovers Within season (52\%) and between year (62\%) site
   fidelity was documented for resightings within 3 5 km of initial
   sighting Although breeding pairs do not winter in close association
   there is some evidence to suggest that offspring winter closer to the
   male rather than the female parent (P value = 0 03) and adult males and
   females appear to exhibit latitudinal segregation (P value < 0 001)
   Females reach the winter grounds before males arriving in July and
   staying through April (similar to 9 months) or 75\% of the annual cycle
   The study is the first to identify winter distribution for the Great
   Lakes Piping Plover population The significant proportion of the annual
   cycle spent on the wintering grounds emphasizes the importance of
   habitat protection during the non breeding season for this federally
   listed population Received 26 December 2008 accepted 1 December 2009}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Forager (predator) abundance may mediate feeding rates in wading birds
   Yet when modeled feeding rates are typically derived from the purely
   prey dependent Holling Type II (HoII) functional response model
   Estimates of feeding rates are necessary to evaluate wading bird
   foraging strategies and their role in food webs thus models that
   Incorporate predator dependence warrant consideration Here data
   collected in a mangrove swamp in Puerto Rico in 1994 were reanalyzed
   reporting feeding rates for mixed species flocks after comparing fits of
   the HoII model as used in the original work to the Beddington DeAngelis
   (BD) and Crowley Martin (CM) predator dependent models Model CM received
   most support (AIC w(1) = 0 44) but models BD and HoII were plausible
   alternatives (Delta AIC(c) <= 2) Results suggested that feeding rates
   were constrained by predator abundance Reductions in rates were
   attributed to interference which was consistent with the independently
   observed increase in aggression as flock size increased (P < 0 05)
   Substantial discrepancies between the CM and HoII models were possible
   depending on flock sizes used to model feeding rates However inferences
   derived from the HoII model as used in the original work were sound
   While Holling s Type II and other purely prey-dependent models have
   fostered advances in wading bird foraging ecology evaluating models that
   incorporate predator dependence could lead to a more adequate
   description of data and processes of interest The mechanistic bases used
   to derive models used here lead to biologically interpretable results
   and advance understanding of wading bird foraging ecology Received 4

Abstract = {{Resource partitioning in three sympatric stork species Black necked
   Stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala)
   and Asian Openbill (Anastomus oscitans)) was studied in the Keoladeo
   National Park India from October 1994 to May 1997 Little is known about
   their feeding success in variable water depths and habitat use The Black
   necked Stork a solitary generalist forager uses tactile and visual
   methods with a high proportion of fish in the diet The Painted Stork and
   Asian Openbill forage in groups of two to 100 Both Painted and Asian
   Openbill Storks are specialists and tactile foragers with the former
   preferring fish and the latter snuls (Pila spp) Differences in prey
   composition were mainly due to difference in feeding behavior and water
   level at foraging sites Peck rate steps and success rate varied
   significantly among the three species and water level influenced feeding
   success The three stork species showed variations in fen aging
   parameters in relation to fine scale habitat use All stork species
   showed preferences for foraging habitat that differed with respect to
   water level vegetation community structure and the presence of prey
   species The fishing depth component of resource segregation as described
   in many wading bird communities has played a major role in determining
   feeding success and reducing niche overlap The findings have application
   to foraging habitat management and the conservation of stork species

Abstract = {{Stable isotope analysis of whole blood was used to examine the feeding

   and Christmas Shearwiters P nativitatus Bonin Pterodroma hypoleuca and
   Bulwers Petrels Bulweria bulwerii and Tristram s Storm petrel
   Oceanodroma tristrami) in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands The goal was
   to compare community foraging patterns as determined by stable isotope
   analysis with traditional studies conducted in the early 1980s
   Furthermore chick rearing Procellariformes have been hypothesized to
   practice a bimodal food provisioning strategy a behavior yet to be
   documented in any of the northwestern Hawrian Islands species outside
   the albatrosses Except for Christmas Shearwaters adults and chicks had
   significantly different isotope ratios suggesting differential self and
   chick provisioning by adults Wedge tailed Shearwaters for aged
   opportunistically for themselves while providing prey of higher trophic
   position to their chicks Bulwer s Petrel and Tristram s Storm petrel
   adults likely brought prey of mote uniform trophic position to their
   chicks while relying on more permanent prey patches differing in
   composition for themselves during the bleeding season Re suits suggested
   little overlap in stable Isotope ratios among species and were likely a

Abstract = {{Time activity budgets foraging habitat quality and behavior of
   Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) were examined during
   three non breeding seasons in a large estuarine system in southeastern
   Gem gm USA Among the foraging sites available to shorebirds at each
   tidal stage non breeding plovers tracked those with the greatest biomass
   and density of Invertebrate prey Prey biomass differed according to
   tidal conditions but was strongly predicted by the salinity organic
   content and particle sizes of the sediments Foraging rates (pecks/min)
   and densities (birds/ha) of plovers were both predicted by invertebrate
   density and biomass Foraging rates correlated significantly with the
   rate of defecations indicating that peck rates were related to Intake
   rates Foraging rates reached an asymptote of 25 pecks per minute
   suggesting an upper limit to the rate of capture unconstrained by
   digestive bottlenecks While available nearly all plovers foraged when on
   mudflat habitats while about 33\% for aged on salt marsh habitats and
   12\% foraged on beaches There was no effect of density of foraging birds
   on their rate of foraging at mudflats suggesting that birds were not
   experiencing intra specific competition at this productive site Received

Abstract = {{Diets of breeding Imperial Cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps were
   studied at two breeding colonies Islas Blancas and Isla Arce located
   approximately 30 km apart in an area subject to increasing fishing
   pressure off Central Patagonia Argentina The goal was to assess
   differences between locations and diet variation among stages of the
   breeding cycle Pellet casts (403 and 358 pellets per colony
   respectively) were collected from November 2002 to February 2003
   Analyses of the pellets revealed that Imperial Cormorants at Islas
   Blancas and Isla Arce fed on at least 25 and 23 prey types, respectively
   Fish showed the highest frequency of occurrence at both colonies (>
   70\%) followed by crustaceans and molluscs Of the fish prey Merluccius
   hubbsi (22 71\%) Engraulis anchoita (16-51\%) and Raneya brasiliensis
   (5-48\%) showed the highest frequencies of occurrence depending on the
   colony and breeding stage At Islas Blancas the consumption of fish and
   crustaceans was similar among breeding stages (incubation young chicks
   and old chicks) while It was significantly different at Isla Arce
   Overall contribution by frequency of occurrence showed that M hubbsi was
   the most frequent prey at Islas Blancas (58\%) and E anchoita and
   Pleoticus muelleri were more frequent at Isla Arce (48 and 45\%
   respectively) Also overall contribution by mass of the main fish prey
   indicated differences between colonies Given the commercial value of the
   main prey species cormorant feeding requirements and spatial ecological
   needs should be Included as considerations in coastal fisheries
   management and future development Received 21 January 2009 accepted 25

Abstract = {{A discriminant function analysis (DFA) model was developed with DNA sex
   verification so that external morphology could be used to sex 203 adult
   California Gulls (Larus californicus) in San Francisco Bay (SFB) The
   best model was 97\% accurate and included head to-bill length culmen
   depth at the gonys and wing length Using an iterative process the model
   was simplified to a single measurement (head to-bill length) that still
   assigned sex correctly 94\% of the time A previous California Gull sex
   determination model developed for a population in Wyoming was then
   assessed by fitting SFB California Gull measurement data to the Wyoming
   model this new model failed to converge on the same measurements as
   those originally used by the Wyoming model Results from the SFB
   discriminant function model were compared to the Wyoming model results
   (by using SFB data with the Wyoming model) the SFB model was 7\% more
   accurate for SFB California gulls The simplified DFA model (head to-bill
   length only) provided highly accurate results (94\%) and minimized the
   measurements and time required to accurately sex California Gulls

Abstract = {{Archived Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) eggs (N = 16) collected in
   1993 from three colonies on the Mississippi River in Minnesota were
   analyzed in 2007 for perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) One of the three colonies Pig s Eye was located
   near a presumed source of PFCs Based on a multivariate analysis the
   pattern of runt PFC concentrations differed significantly between Pig s
   Eye and the upriver (P = 0 002) and downriver (P = 0 02) colonies but
   not between the upriver and downriver colonies (P = 0 25) Mean
   concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) a major PFC compound
   were significantly higher at the Pig s Eye colony (geometric mean = 940
   ng/g wet weight) than at upriver (60 ng/g wet weight) and downriver (131
   ng/g wet weight) colonies Perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations from
   the Pig s Eye colony are among the highest reported in bird eggs
   Concentrations of PFOS in Great Blue Heron eggs from Pig s Eye were well
   below the toxicity thresholds estimated for Bobwhite Quail (Colinus
   virginianus) and Mallards (Anas platyrhyn chos) but within the toxicity
   threshold estimated for White Leghorn Chickens (Gallus domesticus) The
   pattern of six PBDE congener concentrations did not differ among the
   three colonies (P = 0 08) Total PBDE concentrations however were
   significantly greater (P = 0 03) at Pig s Eye (geometric mean = 142 ng/g
   wet weight) than the upriver colony (13 ng/g wet weight) Polybrominated
   diphenyl ether concentrations in two of six Great Blue Heron eggs from
   the Pig s Eye colony were within levels associated with altered
   reproductive behavior in American Kestrels (Fal co sparverius) Received

Abstract = {{The Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) is a globally threatened waterbird From
   October 2007 to April 2008 the time activity budgets of the cranes were
   recorded in Shengjin Lake the main wintering area for the crane in China
   Instantaneous scan sampling was used to observe the behavior of the
   wintering cranes Foraging and alerting were the most frequent diurnal
   behaviors with average diurnal time activity budgets of 60 4\% and 15
   5\% respectively The time budgets for diurnal behaviors were
   significantly different from 07 00 to 18 00 for all behavior categories
   except for alerting and social behaviors Over the winter period the time
   budget for foraging increased from 56 2\% in the early stages to 65 7\%
   in the late stage However the percentage of time spent alerting
   decreased from 20 7\% to 10 4\% as winter progressed In family groups
   adults usually spent more time on maintenance alerting locomotion and
   social behaviors and less time on foraging and resting than juveniles in
   all wintering stages In the early and middle of winter the foraging time
   budget of adults was significantly different from that of juveniles
   while at the late stage it was not The alerting time budget of adults
   was significantly different from that of juveniles in the early and
   middle stages of winter but the difference were less statistically
   significance in the late stage The results imply that wintering cranes
   in Shengjin Lake exhibit different behavioral patterns over the
   different winter stages to adapt to the degraded and disturbed
   environment and parental care of offspring should in crease juvenile
   survival Received 28 February 2009 accepted 11 July 2009}},

Abstract = {{Post juvenile molt of Common Snipe was investigated during 2004-05 at
   the Jeziorsko reservoir central Poland Body mass and mass of fat stores
   were dependent on the stage of post juvenile molt The body mass
   increased prior to the commencement of molt but during the intensive
   stage of the process it decreased and re turned to the previous level
   Fat free body mass increased during molt which may be attributed to
   increased protein synthesis or the higher water content of growing
   feathers Fat stores were similar in snipe before and in the initial
   stage of molt however they decreased significantly during the transition
   to the intensive stage of the process In total snipe lost approximately
   57\% of the mass of fat loads ON er the course of molt (49\% of lean
   body mass) Being a highly energetic constraint post juvenile molt is
   suggested to affect certain life history traits of Common Snipe such as
   the length of the staging periods during the autumn migratory period

Title = {{Why Study Birds in Rice Fields?}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the world's most important crops. The crop
   is grown in at least 114 countries, occupies over 156 million ha of land
   annually, is a primary source of nutrition for over half the world's
   human population and constitutes over a fifth of the global grain
   supply. Rice is generally grown under flooded conditions and, if managed
   appropriately, can provide important habitat for wetland species.
   Waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds and other waterbirds use rice
   fields, foraging on a variety of prey, nesting in the crop and in
   fringing vegetation, and staging during migration. Conflicts also exist,
   with some cropping practices harmful to birds and some bird activity
   detrimental to yield production. Much early research on waterbirds in
   rice fields was conducted in Mediterranean Europe with only scattered
   work elsewhere. More recently, there has been a growing focus on the
   conservation value of rice fields, with studies from most of the major
   regions where rice is grown. The body of research has included:
   community studies of the range of birds that use rice fields, detailed
   studies of endangered species, behavioral studies of reproductive
   success, foraging ecology and movement, and applied studies of cropping
   techniques. As the world's natural wetlands diminish, researchers
   studying waterbirds in rice fields are working to globalize interactions
   with each other. Also, some researchers are working closely with
   conservation groups and rice growers to identify ways to maximize the
   benefits of agricultural wetlands while minimizing the agronomic costs.

Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza saliva) is the main cereal grown in the Republic of Korea
   and Japan and is planted on 54\% and 36\% of agricultural lands,
   respectively. Information on the status of birds that use rice fields in
   these nations was reviewed. More than 30\%, or 135 species of 430 native
   avian species, excluding 152 accidental visitors, use rice fields. The
   fields serve primarily as foraging habitat, providing aquatic prey for
   passage, summer and resident species and residual grains for winter
   visitors. Some species, such as the Grey-faced Buzzard (Butastur
   indicus), require a mosaic of rice fields and forests for successful
   breeding. However, most waterbirds prefer rice fields in wide, open
   plains rather than narrow rice fields surrounded by forest. At least 32
   (24\%) of 135 species that use rice fields are designated threatened at
   the global or national scale, and eleven (22\%) of 49 globally
   threatened species found in Korea and Japan use rice fields. Populations
   of most gmnivorous and piscivorous waterbirds such as geese, cranes and
   herons tend to be stable or increasing. The Baikal Teal (Anas formosa)
   is an exception. The breeding ranges or populations of some carnivorous
   and insectivorous birds, such as the Ruddy-breasted Crake (Porzana
   fusca), Greater Painted Snipe (Rostratula benghalerisis) and many
   shorebirds have shrunk in recent decades. Some agricultural and
   conservation sectors have succeeded in attracting many waterbirds by
   flooding fallow fields in the rice-growing season and post-harvest rice
   fields. Further research on the direct and indirect effects of
   agricultural practices and conservation measures is needed in Korea and
   Japan. Received 19 October 2007, accepted 7 July 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Data on wild birds in rice fields in China are scarce. The potential
   significance of Chinese rice fields, which represent about 6\% of the
   world's wetland area, is considerable but whether this potential is met
   is largely unknown. In this review, traditional and modern Chinese rice
   agriculture are compared, including detailing historical changes and
   their implications for wild birds. Traditional practices, with one crop
   each year and long periods of fallow flooding, provide greater benefit
   to biodiversity and species such as the Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon).
   The method and alternatives, such as rice-fish, duck-rice and swidden
   agriculture, are contrasted with modern techniques which, through
   associated water regimes and chemical use, have been implicated in the
   decline of biodiversity and of species such as the Black-faced Spoonbill
   (Platalea minor. Agrochemical use is particularly pertinent because
   China is likely to have been the world's largest pesticide consumer
   since the mid-1990s, with use greatest in rice (Oryza saliva). However,
   few studies have measured the direct effects of agro-chemicals on wild
   birds in China. The most detailed information on birds in China's rice
   fields comes from charismatic species such as the Crested Ibis and
   Red-crowned Crane (Grus japonensis). Preliminary data from possibly the
   first systematic bird survey of a Chinese rural county are presented.
   More detailed and widespread studies of the implications of rice
   agriculture to wild birds in China are required. Received 19 August
   2008, accepted 16 July 2009.}},

Pages = {{44-70}},
Abstract = {{The Indian subcontinent has the world's highest cropland cover per unit
   area with rice (Oryza sativa) being the second-most important crop, and
   is home to nearly 1,300 species of birds. The significance of rice
   fields as bird habitat in the region is not well understood and the
   subject is reviewed using a combination of published and secondary
   information. Rice fields in the subcontinent are used by at least 351
   species, although only 2.7\% of birds occurring in the subcontinent
   breed in rice fields. The spread of rice cultivation and its attendant
   secondary habitats may have contributed to the increase in range and
   population of 64 common species but is threatening hundreds of other
   species, many of conservation concern. Most work in the region has
   focused on birds as pests of rice. Few studies have been conducted on
   the habits of birds that use rice fields and fewer still have compared
   how rice fields and similar natural habitats differ. Although rice
   harvesting has caused nest mortality, for breeding birds, there is no
   comparable information from natural habitats. The guild structure of
   birds in rice fields is similar to that overall in the region except for
   a higher representation of carnivores. Rice fields are used primarily,
   by grassland and wetland species. There are large information gaps that
   require filling to be able to ascertain the utility, or impact of rice
   fields to bird populations and, thus, many research opportunities.

Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza saliva) growing in Australia occurs almost exclusively in
   the south-east, in the Riverine Plains of the Murray-Darling Basin, with
   an annual average of 110,000 ha. All crops are grown under irrigation
   using water abstracted from rivers. Rice fields are flooded between
   October and March and are dry otherwise. A large decrease in natural
   wetland extent and declines in most waterbird populations have been
   associated with the increase in irrigated agriculture since the 1960s.
   The ecology of waterbirds in rice fields has been studied in only one
   area, around Fivebough Swamp in southern New South Wales. Thirty-seven
   waterbird species were recorded in rice fields compared with 70 species
   on an adjacent natural wetland. Species diversity and the abundance of
   individual species declined as the rice crops developed so that most
   species used rice fields for only one to two months after flooding. An
   increase in water depths associated with the timing of panicle
   initiation of the rice plants was probably the main cause, but declines
   in most waterbird prey species also occurred as the crops developed.
   Rice crops were particularly important feeding areas for Glossy Ibis
   (Plegadis falcinellus) during November and December. Small numbers of
   the threatened Australasian Bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus) were also
   recorded. Received 23 October 2007, accepted 23 January 2009.}},

Abstract = {{In southern Europe, rice (oryza sativa) is one of the most important
   agricultural crops. Relationships between rice fields anti bird
   occurrence are well studied for some taxa while quantitative data are
   lacking for other, more secretive, species. Rice cultivation may be
   important in the conservation of some threatened birds; for example,
   agricultural flooded areas in northwestern Italy support 25\% of the
   Italian population of Eurasian Bittern (Bo-tarus stellaris) although
   variation in farming techniques affect the suitability of fields for
   birds. Agricultural practices that benefit birds include avoiding
   intermittent flooding or dry cultivation, maintaining stubble during
   winter, allowing some weed patches to persist inside fields and along
   ditches and conserving natural vegetation in rice field landscapes.
   Additionally, biological and alternative cultivation methods seem to
   provide better environmental conditions compared to traditional methods.
   To promote environmental and conservation values of rice fields,
   BirdLife International coordinates a project throughout Europe for
   expanding environmentally-friendly rice cultivation. In some regions,
   rice fields are the only habitat available for wetland birds due to the
   scarcity or poor quality of natural wetlands. Despite interest in
   African and Middle Eastern birds and the geographical proximity of these
   areas to Europe, knowledge of birds and rice fields there is extremely
   limited. The fact that these regions are located along some of the most
   important migration routes in the Old World suggests that their rice
   fields may be used by large numbers of waterbirds. Received 7 February

Abstract = {{Rice fields in West Africa comprise mangrove swamp rice and rain-fed
   rice cultivations along the coast, rice fields in floodplains and river
   valleys, and inland irrigated cultivations. All these rice systems
   constitute important habitats for African and migratory Palaearctic
   waterbirds. Density counts reveal the presence of about 16
   wetland-related birds per ha during the northern winter if the habitat
   is still damp or covered by water; this declines to about four birds/ha
   if the fields are dry. The coastal rice fields (South
   Senegal-Guinea-Conakry) harbour 1.17 million wetland-related birds
   during the northern winter, and the inland rice fields of Office du
   Niger (Mali) contain 730,000. In former floodplain areas, the high bird
   numbers in rice fields offer, to sonic degree, an ecological
   compensation for the loss of floodplains. In the Inner Niger Delta, for
   example, the construction of the Selingue Dam and the Office du Niger
   irrigation scheme resulted on average in the loss of 12\% of the
   wintering waterbirds. However, the ecological loss is larger than these
   numbers suggest because most bird species in irrigated rice fields are
   common, while rare and endangered species are concentrated in the
   remaining West African floodplains that have not been converted to
   cultivated rice fields. Received 1 August 2008, accepted 6 January 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza sativa) is cultivated in 21 countries throughout North,
   South and Central America, and the Caribbean. Waterbird and landbird use
   of rice paddies in the Americas was evaluated. Information was compiled
   on birds and rice habitats from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica,
   Cuba, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela. At least
   169 waterbirds belonging to 21 families and 166 landbirds have been
   recorded in the paddies of the region. Anatidae was the best represented
   family, followed by Scolopacidae, Rallidae and Ardeidae; 67\% of species
   belonged to these four families. Western Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis),
   Western Great Egret (Ardea alba), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula),
   Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Lesser Yellowlegs
   (Tringa flavipes) and Greater Yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca) were
   reported in all countries, but relative abundances varied. During the
   rice-growing cycle, fields were most important for carnivorous birds
   during the sowing stage, whereas post-harvest flooded fields were most
   valuable for granivorous waterbirds. Of 92 genera recorded, 28 had
   sympatric species. In general, geographically proximate countries were
   most similar in the composition of bird species using their paddies. In
   all countries, rice fields are considered important feeding areas and
   heavily used as migratory stop-over and wintering sites. Received 3

Abstract = {{Important and unique breeding bird communities occur in rice fields
   throughout the world, but little is known about breeding densities and
   nest success, and, therefore, the value of rice fields to breeding
   birds. Breeding bird use of rice fields is divided into five categories:
   1) nesting in standing rice crop, 2) nesting on levees within fields or
   at field perimeters, 3) nesting in associated irrigation canals and
   ditches, 4) nesting in other wet areas that exist because of rice
   cultivation, and 5) use of fields for foraging, while breeding in
   adjacent habitats. Nest density and nest success vary greatly based on
   the region, management practices, and species' requirements. Birds
   commonly nesting in rice fields include ducks, bitterns, rails,
   shorebirds, terns and some passerines. Herons often use rice fields
   heavily while breeding in adjacent habitat. Research on nest densities,
   nest success, nestling and fledgling success, and microhabitat selection
   is needed to better understand the bird communities that use rice
   fields. Received 22 July 2008, accepted 15 May 2009.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Pages = {{133-150}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide, rice (Oryza saliva) agriculture typically involves seasonal
   flooding and soil tillage, which provides a variety of microhabitats and
   potential food for birds. Water management in rice fields creates
   conditions ranging from saturated mud flats to shallow (<30 cm) water,
   thereby attracting different guilds of birds. Grain not collected during
   harvest (i.e. waste rice) is typically the most abundant potential food
   of birds in rice fields, with estimates of seed mass from North America
   ranging from 66-672 kg/ha. Although initially abundant after harvest,
   waste rice availability can be temporally limited. Few abundance
   estimates for other foods, such as vertebrate prey or forage vegetation,
   exist for rice fields. Outside North America, Europe and japan, little
   is known about abundance and importance of any avian food in rice
   fields. Currently, flooding rice fields after harvest is the best known
   management practice to attract and benefit birds. Studies from North
   America indicate specific agricultural practices (e.g. burning stubble)
   may increase use and improve access to food resources. Evaluating and
   implementing management practices that are ecologically sustainable,
   increase food for birds and are agronomically beneficial should be
   global priorities to integrate rice production and avian conservation.
   Finally, land area devoted to rice agriculture appears to be stable in
   the USA, declining in China, and largely unquantified in many regions.
   Monitoring trends in riceland area may provide information to guide
   avian conservation planning in rice-agriculture ecosystems. Received 17
   October 2007, accepted 28 April 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Literature is reviewed to determine the effects of landscape features on
   waterbird use of fields in regions where rice (Oryza saliva) is grown.
   Rice-growing landscapes often consist of diverse land uses and land
   cover, including rice fields, irrigation ditches, other agricultural
   fields, grasslands, forests and natural wetlands. Numerous studies
   indicate that local management practices, such as water depth and timing
   of flooding and drawdown, can strongly influence waterbird use of a
   given rice field. However, the effects of size and distribution of rice
   fields and associated habitats at a landscape scale have received less
   attention. Even fewer studies have focused on local and landscape
   effects simultaneously. Habitat connectivity; area of rice, distance to
   natural wetlands, and presence and distance to unsuitable habitat can be
   important parameters influencing bird use of rice fields. However,
   responses to a given landscape vary with landscape structure, scale of
   analysis, among taxa and within taxa among seasons. A lack of
   multi-scale studies, particularly those extending beyond simple presence
   and abundance of a given species, and a lack of direct tests comparing
   the relative importance of landscape features with in-field management
   activities limits understanding of the importance of landscape in these
   systems and hampers waterbird conservation and management. Received 25

Abstract = {{The effect of rice cultivation on waterbird populations has rarely been
   assessed. A study in northwestern Italy estimated that breeding herons
   and egrets obtained 80\% of their food from agricultural habitats. The
   estimate was checked by comparing the occupation of three contiguous
   sectors of northwestern Italy, one with mainly rice fields, a second
   with planitial rivers and a third with small upland rivers, from 1982 to
   2002, a period in which breeding populations increased. During the
   increase, the breeders expanded into the second and third sectors only
   when their population exceeded a certain level, in accordance with
   predictions of the ``ideal free{''} model of habitat selection. The
   initial estimate of the importance of rice cultivation is confirmed by
   this long-term comparison, with the ``rice fields{''} sector hosting
   76\% of the population. The long-term analysis cautions against
   generalizations from instantaneous surveys, which can estimate the
   differential profitability of habitats but not their carrying capacity,
   unless habitat availability limits population size. Additional
   information is needed to predict waterbird population responses to
   environmental change; topics include: habitat use, particularly in Asia;
   landscape effects; prey availability, foraging intake and behavior;
   demographic parameters such as breeding success, survival, settlement
   patterns, site fidelity, and temporal variance; and population changes
   in relation to management practices. Received 6 November 2007, accepted

Abstract = {{Most literature on birds and rice (Oryza saliva) focuses on the
   non-growing period and little is known about the influence of management
   practices during cultivation. A review found that the main factors
   affecting species composition and abundance in rice fields during the
   growing season were water level, flooding period, rice plant structure
   and size, and pesticide use. Highest bird density and diversity occurred
   at intermediate water levels (10-20 cm). Early flooding and late drying
   favored waterbird density and diversity, and the stopover of migrating
   species. Taller plants, at higher densities, reduced prey availability
   to most waterbirds but favored smaller species. Pesticides and
   herbicides have been shown to be toxic to birds and reduce food
   resources. A case study is presented for the Ebro delta, Spain. Three
   management schemes were compared: organic, agri-environmental and
   conventional. Bird density, biomass and diversity throughout the growing
   and non-growing seasons were determined in three consecutive years. Bird
   biomass, density and diversity averaged higher in the organic rice
   fields, but only biomass was significantly different. The higher biomass
   reflects the presence of a higher biomass of prey items (fish,
   invertebrates and macrophytes) in the organic rice fields, likely due to
   the lack of pesticides. Further research should focus on a quantitative
   assessment of the effects of specific management practices. Received 22

Abstract = {{Fields planted with rice (Oryza saliva) are used by a wide variety of
   bird species during the non-growing season and play an important
   conservation role in many parts of the world. Management of fields
   affects the variety and number of birds that use them, and a thorough
   understanding of these issues could improve the conservation value of
   rice farming. The challenge for conservation practitioners is
   identifying management actions that provide benefits, without adverse
   impacts on crop production. Harvest method, post-harvest straw
   management, winter flooding, food supplementation and hunting all
   influence bird populations. Also, field preparation methods, organic
   farming and the management of field margins and drainage ditches,
   probably influence the conservation value of rice agriculture but have
   received less attention. Current knowledge of these issues is reviewed
   in order to identify management practices thought to have conservation
   benefits and highlight topics that warrant additional research. Received

Abstract = {{Waterbird use of agricultural wetlands has increased as natural wetlands
   have declined. Use of rice (oryza sativa) habitats by some waterbird
   species is considered essential to sustaining populations. Although use
   of rice habitats by waterbirds has been documented throughout the world,
   little information is available on potential risks as a result of
   chemicals used in rice cultivation. The current review summarizes
   understanding of the use and consequences to birds of pesticide
   applications in rice habitats. Historically, organochlorine pesticides
   known to be applied for pest management in rice cultivation included
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), aldrin, dield-rin, , endrin,
   heptachlor, technical hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), toxaphene, endosulfan
   and sodium pentachlo-rophenate. Endosulfan and purified HCH (the gamma
   isomer lindane) are still in use. Cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides
   currently used in rice include carbofuran, monocrotophos, phorate,
   diazinon, fenthion, phosphami-don, methyl parathion and
   azinphos-methyl-many products known to cause acute poisoning in birds.
   In addition, herbicides, fungicides, molluscicides and other pesticide
   types are used in rice cultivation. Some of the chemicals are highly
   toxic to birds and associated with mortality; several have the potential
   of causing adverse reproductive effects. Because of the large area under
   rice cultivation worldwide, the volume of pesticides applied to rice
   fields is significant. Innovations within the past few decades in rice
   production have increased pesticide use resulting in biodiversity losses
   in production areas and pollution of water resources. Management
   practices that address adverse effects of pesticide use in rice fields
   include increased adoption of Integrated Pest Management principles and
   less toxic products. Received 5 March 2009, accepted 3.1 July 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Wild waterfowl are the reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIV's), a
   family of RNA viruses that may cause mild sickness in waterbirds.
   Emergence of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain,
   causing severe disease and mortality in wild birds, poultry and humans,
   had raised concerns about the role of wild birds in possible
   transmission of the disease. In this review, the link between rice
   production systems, poultry production systems, and wild bird ecology is
   examined to assess the extent to which these interactions could
   contribute towards the persistence and evolution of HPAI H5N1. The rice
   (Oryza saliva) and poultry production systems in Asia described, and
   then migration and movements of wild birds discussed. Mixed farming
   systems in Asia and wild bird movement and migration patterns create
   opportunities for the persistence of low pathogenic AIVs in these
   systems. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of long-term persistence of
   HPAI viruses (including the H5N1 subtype) in the wild. There are still
   significant gaps in the understanding of how AIVs circulate in rice
   systems. A better understanding of persistence of AIVs in rice farms,
   particularly of poultry origins, is essential in limiting exchange of
   AIVs between mixed-farming systems, poultry and wild birds. Received 17

Abstract = {{Considerable work has been done to investigate linkages between the
   production of rice (Oryza sativa) and bird ecology and conservation.
   Rice is an extremely important crop globally and affects waterbirds in
   diverse ways. Rice fields are not substitutes for natural wetlands but
   are used by many species and can help mitigate the loss of natural
   habitats in areas where agriculture dominates. Most birds use rice
   fields primarily for foraging, but, some-including rare species-also
   nest in rice. Field management affects birds in numerous ways, some of
   which have been studied in detail, but most of which have not.
   Increasing collaboration between researchers, farmers and agronomists
   provides opportunities to better understand how field management can be
   modified to increase the conservation value of fields without
   compromising the economic viability of farming. Such research would
   facilitate the development of well-designed agri-environment schemes and
   provide a solid basis for marketing ``wildlife-friendly{''} rice
   products. Other major topics where future research is needed include:
   nesting and post-fledging success; availability and value of foods other
   than rice grain that are found in fields; importance of field edges and
   water delivery infrastructure; influence of landscape features; effects
   of rice farming on population dynamics; experimental studies of
   management activities, especially at large spatial scales, in tropical
   regions, and during the breeding season; and an improved understanding
   of how socio-economic factors influence the ecology and conservation of
   the wetland birds that use rice fields. Received 26 April 2010, accepted

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrcorax auritus) and other piscivorous
   birds are frequently implicated in having negative effects on commercial
   and sport fisheries despite the fact that several Studies suggest that
   Such effects may be infrequent. Increase.,; in cormorant populations in
   North America over the last decades have fueled the debate further and
   Population controls, official and unofficial, are in effect in several
   jurisdictions. Of importance to the management community is the need to
   obtain the best information on actual diets of cormorants throughout
   their annual cycle but particularly on the temperate breeding grounds
   Where they frequently overlap with fisheries. Despite success in
   quantifying seabird diets, managers have yet to exploit the potential of
   the stable isotope approach to examine trophodynamics of cormorants
   where they can potentially interfere with fisheries. Here, the use of
   stable isotope methods (delta N-15 and delta C-13) to quantitatively
   predict trophic interactions between cormorants and their prey are
   recommended to augment conventional dietary approaches. The stable
   isotope approach is particularly Suited to Situations where birds feed
   at a single, well-defined lake or waterbody. The approach can provide a
   quantitative estimate of fish consumption to species or species groups
   in cases where such groups are isotopically distinct. This paper is
   intended to provide the research and management communities with the
   necessary background to apply stable isotope methods to better assess
   diets of cormorants and other piscivorous waterbirds. Received 21

Abstract = {{Prey items fed to chicks of eight individually-marked and known
   specialist Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) were watched over a 15-year
   period at Coats Island, Nunavut, and time-depth recorders attached to
   eight birds in two separate years. Two males were amphipod specialists,
   one male a cod specialist and another male a shanny specialist; two
   females were sculpin specialists and two capelin specialists. Although
   there was likely sonic gender-related component to diet, there were
   clear specializations within each gender. Specialization in diet was
   mirrored by specialization in foraging behavior: amphipod specialists
   made V-shaped dives and had short foraging ranges, shanny/cod
   specialists made many shallow dives, sculpin specialists made deep,
   U-shaped dives, while capelin specialists made V- or W-shaped dives to
   moderate depths. There was no clear pattern between specialties and age
   or reproductive success. The use of longitudinal Studies in foraging
   behavior, as long-term studies of individuals can complement existing
   knowledge of the flexibility or specialization of waterbirds, is
   encouraged. Received 27 November 2008, accepted 10 February 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Beginning in the 1960s, Ring-billed Gulls' (Larus delawarensis) historic
   breeding range expanded from inland habitats and freshwater wetlands to
   marine sites in Atlantic North America. Adults winter On salt water but
   salt tolerance may entail costs (e.g. maintenance of salt glands) and
   favor reduced parental use of marine resources for feeding chicks. Diets
   of Ring-billed Gull chicks nesting on a marine island off Prince Edward
   Island, Canada, were investigated using soft regurgitant collection and
   stable isotope (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) analysis of both regurgitants
   and blood samples. Isotopic signatures in blood of chicks of Ring-billed
   and symptrically-nesting Herring (L. argentatus) and Great Black-backed
   Gulls (L. marinus) were also compared. Regurgitants of Ring-billed Gull
   chicks contained freshwater/terrestrial and marine invertebrates and
   fish. A stable isotope Mixing model incorporating both delta(13)C and
   delta(15)N in chick regurgitants and blood estimated that 42.2\% of
   Ring-billed Gull chick diet came from the marine environment, whereas
   estimates from blood for Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls were
   43.6\%, and 73.5\%, respectively. Further, differences existed among
   gull species in estimates for dietary contribution from various food
   sources from marine and terrestrial/freshwater environments. Although
   Ring-billed Gulls can use marine food sources to feed their young,
   whether salt in marine food imposes a physiological cost on these Young
   in comparison to young reared exclusively on non-marine foods is
   nuclear. Received 11 December 2008, accepted 24 June 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The Black-winged Stilt. (Himantopus himantopus) is a long-distance
   migratory wader common in Europe, North Africa, Asia and Australia.
   Diets of Black-winged Stilt chicks collected from breeding sites in
   southwestern Taiwan between April and September 1999-2001 were
   investigated. The contents of 305 stomachs were examined and 12,176 food
   items categorized into seven classes, 17 orders, 39 families and 48
   species of animals. Prey importance was determined by the index of
   Acosta (I'a); i.e. the sum of the relative frequency of occurrence,
   relative abundance and relative estimated volume. The mean abundance and
   estimated volume of animal contents per stomach were 39 +/- 6 items and
   80 +/- 10 mm(3), respectively. The main aquatic invertebrate prey (I'a >
   10) were water scavenger beetles (Hydrophilidae), biting midges
   (Ceratopogonidae), chironomid midges (Chironomidae), shore flies
   (Ephydridae), house flies (Muscidae) and brine shrimp (Artemiidae). The
   total relative frequency of occurrence, relative abundance and relative
   estimated volume of these six families were over 64\%, 87\% and 72\%,
   respectively. The major prey size range of stilt chicks was 2.7-7.4
   mm(3), which comprised only 18\% of the total relative abundance of diet
   items while contributing 42\% of the total estimated diet volume. Two
   alien (an Oreochromis hybrid and Gambusia affinis) and one indigenous
   (Yongeichthys caninus) fish species were also important contributors to
   the relative estimated volume (17\% in total). The findings suggest that
   water-level management may improve the feeding habitats of stilts.

Abstract = {{The Argentinean Pampas is an ecologically disturbed region where patchy
   wetlands form complex habitats with surrounding agricultural areas.
   Numerous bird species concentrate in these sites at breeding colonies
   and communal roosts. For two consecutive five years, point censuses Were
   made of birds in the vicinity of a roosting and breeding area at Los
   Padres Lake in the south-cast Pampas's plain. In parallel with these
   censuses, limnological analyses (e.g. nutrient concentration,
   conductivity, water transparency and temperature) were conducted to
   correlate changes in the structure of waterbird assemblages With
   environmental variability. Seasonal variability in the structure of
   waterbird assemblages could be clue to changes in the birds' habitat Use
   and reproductive phenology through the year (e.g. colonies, foraging and
   roosting sites) and land use in neighboring areas (e.g. for agricultural
   practices). Waterbird abundance in July and August correlated with
   phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, which were linked to changes of
   waterbird assemblages and their feeding behavior. The present study
   shows the potential importance of waterbird communities in contributing
   biotic nutrients to Pampas wetlands. Received 18 September 2008,
   accepted 22 April 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Many salt ponds around the Mediterranean are being either abandoned or
   converted into aquaculture enterprises, which affects their use by
   migratory shorebirds. Effective management of salt ponds can improve
   their attractiveness to birds but requires a better understanding of the
   shorebirds' response to variations ill environmental conditions of the
   ponds. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the relative
   importance of different types of salt pond (industrial, traditional and
   inactive) to shorebirds throughout the tidal cycle, its Well as
   determine the environmental factors that affect the use of salt ponds by
   shorebirds. Birds were counted during low and high tides oil salt ponds
   in the Guadiana estuary, southeast Portugal. Simultaneously, the
   environmental conditions of each of the 212 pans studied were recorded
   and their importance analyzed using logistic regression models. Although
   more birds used the salt ponds during the high-tide, many species stayed
   in the study area during low-tide, suggesting a preference to feed oil
   salt ponds as compared to tidal flats. Industrial salt ponds were
   preferred by most of the species. Water depth, salinity and area were
   major factors in explaining the presence of the shorebirds and, hence,
   are the most important environmental variables to take into
   consideration when devising management plans for salt ponds. Received 6

Abstract = {{Reproduction within a recently re-introduced resident flock of Whooping
   Cranes (G wits americana) in Florida during 1992-2007 was poor compared
   to air established wild flock. Pairing and nesting increased with
   average age of the flock, but fertility, hatching and fledging were
   variable among years, suggestive of an environmental influence. For
   climatic variables measured during the incubation period, only maximum
   soil temperature was associated with the failure of late nests in dry
   years. However, pre-nesting winter precipitation and water elevation
   were positively correlated with air index of nesting effort. Winter
   precipitation was associated with fertility and hatchability, whereas
   winter marsh water levels were associated with earlier nesting dates and
   increased egg volume. Both winter precipitation (>8 cm mean monthly) and
   water elevation (>20.3 in above mean sea level or 68\% of full marsh
   surface area or perimeter) greater than a threshold level appeared to be
   good predictors for successful reproduction in central Florida, but
   Occurred together in only four often study period years. Pairs delayed
   nesting, had smaller eggs, and hatched and fledged fewer chicks in years
   with low winter water elevation. Low winter precipitation associated
   with decreased fertility of eggs may explain the failure of fully
   incubated nests to hatch in some years. Insufficient stimulation of the
   neuroendocrine system due to limited rainfall and poor physiological
   condition due to poor food resources in low water marshes ate proposed
   mechanisms for low fertility and delayed nesting and egg size,
   respectively. Drought appears to encourage birds to use lake edges for
   nesting which have increased hazards. Thus, conservation of wetlands for
   cranes should include (feel) marshes and lake edges with controlled boat
   usage during the nesting season. Further investigation is recommended
   for pre-nesting and incubation behaviors, diseases of eggs, and egg
   volumes. Received 2 June 2008, accepted 29 January 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Wintering diving duck (Aythya spp.) time-activity budgets have been
   developed for many species in different regions. As such, direct
   comparisons call be made among studies where Substantial deviations in
   ``normal{''} activity budgets call provide insight as to how location,
   food resources, habitat, weather and human disturbance may
   differentially influence behavior(s) during winter. To examine how
   diving ducks use large reservoirs in eastern Texas, 1,275 individual
   time-activity budgets were quantified for Canvasback (Aythya
   valisineria), Lesser Scaup (A. affinis) and Ring-necked Duck (A.
   collaris) wintering on B.A. Steinhagen, Sam Rayburn and Toledo Bend
   Reservoirs during winter 2003/2004 and 2004/2005. Behaviors varied among
   species (P<0.001), where food acquisition, locomotion and
   resting-related behaviors dominated time-activity budgets. All three
   species spent similar time feeding compared to other studies in the
   southeastern United States, but spent substantially more time locomoting
   than previously reported. Human disturbances from boat traffic were
   associated with time spent locomoting, but no species dramatically
   increased time feeding to compensate for increased time locomoting.
   Wintering diving duck activity budgets on these large eastern Texas
   reservoirs were generally similar to previous studies in the southeast.
   However, the (in)direct. impacts, of boat disturbances warrants closer
   investigation, specifically related to wintering waterfowl responses and
   the potential utility or value of voluntary avoidance areas during
   winter. Received 21 November 2008, accepted. 19 March 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The reduced mobility of flightless waterbirds during wing-feather molt
   should influence time allocation during the day, but time-budget studies
   are lacking in most species. Here, time budget: of flightless and
   fully-winged individuals at Lake Constance, Central Europe, were
   compared for five waterbird species with different feeding ecology, and
   varying sensitivity to disturbances or predation pressure. Significant
   differences in diurnal activity budgets of flightless and fully-winged
   birds were observed in all five species. Different behaviors were
   responsible for the observed differences. Flightless Mute Swans 6 gnus
   olor spent more time feeding while decreasing locomotory activity.
   Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina also increased feeding, but, in
   addition, had increased locomotory activity while resting less. In
   contrast, flightless individuals of both Gadwall Anas strepera and
   Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula spent less time foraging, while there was
   no such change in Eurasian COOL Fulica atra. More consistent patterns
   were observed in vigilance behavior, which increased in three of the
   five species. Comfort activities, Such as preening, increased in two
   species, and were unchanged in the remaining three. Social interactions,
   which constituted only a small part of the daily budget, only changed
   ill Gadwall. The present data suggest that the five waterbird species
   meet the increased energy demands during molt by either one or a
   combination of behavioral adaptations, i.e. different strategies, such
   as higher nutrient intake (e.g. Mute Swan, Red-crested Pochard), lower
   energy consumption by reducing the locomotory component (e.g. Mute Swan,
   Tufted Duck) Or a breakdown of energy reserves deposited prior to the
   molting period resulting ill more time spent resting (e.g. Gadwall).
   Also, increased resting times during the day may indicate nocturnal
   feeding, which needs to be examined in more detail. Received 25

Abstract = {{Many studies on the effects of human disturbance on birds have focused
   on adults and report mainly negative effects. Few focus oil effects oil
   chicks. Here, an experimental approach was used to determine effects of
   human disturbance oil chick growth. Cassin's Anklet chicks were assigned
   to one of three groups (control, low and high disturbance). In
   experimental groups, a person walked close to the burrow entrance four
   times or eight times a day, according to the disturbance level assigned.
   Growth (mass increment and wing length increase) was measured and
   compared between the tin cc groups. Since adults are absent from the
   nest during the day, chicks, but riot their parents, experienced the
   disturbance regime. Body condition and experience (age) of the parents
   did not influence peak or fledging mass of chicks subject to
   disturbance. Chicks were not affected by disturbance ill the early
   stages of growth, while chicks in the experimental groups stopped
   gaining weight sooner than controls and fledged at lower weights (6 to
   9\% less) compared to chicks in the control group. Chicks in the high
   disturbance group had a lower peak (F(2,68) = 7.53, P<0.001) and
   fledging mass, (F(2.68)= 17.274, P<0.001) compared to chicks in the
   control group, while chicks in the low disturbance group had a lower
   fledging mass (F(2,68) = 17.274, P<0.001) but similar peak mass. As
   subesequent survival of chicks is likely to be affected by their mass at
   fledging, the results show that it is necessary to consider the chick
   growth stage when making management plans for areas with burrow-nesting
   seabirds. Received 5 September 2008, accepted 2 July 2009.}},

Abstract = {{King Rails (Rallus elegans) and Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris) are
   large, secretive waterbirds whose ranges overlap in brackish marshes
   along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. King and Clapper Rails are difficult
   to separate by physical appearance and there is currently no reliable
   method to distinguish between the two species. Here, the relative
   effectiveness of using discriminant analysis of morphometric
   measurements to identify and sex King and Clapper Rails was examined.
   Mean measurements Of Wing, tarsus, and weight were different between
   male King and Clapper Rails and between female King and Clapper Rails.
   However, for all measurements except culmen,, male Clapper Rails and
   female King Rails were not different. Discriminate analysis of
   morphometric measurements revealed that wing, tarsus, and culmen
   measurements differentiated between King and Clapper Rails, but
   cross-validation results for male Clapper Rails were only 73\%. Male
   King Rails were larger than female King Rails for all morphometric
   measurements and male Clapper Rails were larger than female Clapper
   Rails for all morphometric measurements except for the tail. Wing and
   tarsus measurements differentiated between male and female King Rails
   and wing, tarsus, and culmen measurements differentiated between male
   and female Clapper Rails. Received 6 February 2008, accepted 12 August

Abstract = {{Although DDE caused reproductive failures in a wide variety of bird
   species during the 1950s-1970s, the mechanism (s) by which it acted have
   still not been fully elucidated. This experimental study was designed to
   test an hypothesis that the primary mechanism by which DDE caused
   hatching failure in Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) was by disrupting the
   structure of the eggshell, leading to reduced exchange of O-2 and CO2
   through the shell to and from the embryo. In the study, gas exchange
   through two groups of Common Tern eggshells was reduced by 12\% or 28\%
   by seating parts of the surface with acrylic resin. Contrary to
   predictions from the hypothesis, all treated eggs hatched and there were
   no other changes in breeding success relative to untreated controls. The
   result, suggests that DDE caused embryonic deaths in Common Terns by
   mechanisms acting Within the egg rather than by modification of the
   structure or respiratory properties of the shell. Received 15 November

Abstract = {{Previous reports of female-female pairings in seabirds concerned
   surface-nesting species only and the genetic relatedness between the two
   females has been determined only once. Here, the first observation of a
   female-female pair (detected by molecular sexing) in a burrow-nesting
   seabird is documented. In 2003, two female Cory's Shearwaters
   (Calonectris diomedea) were found incubating the same egg, from which a
   chick hatched. A genetic (microsatellite) analysis showed that the two
   females were unrelated. This study provides additional evidence that
   petrel mating systems may be more flexible than initially thought.
   Female-female pairing in burrow-nesting seabirds might be promoted by
   similar factors to surface-nesting seabirds, and might have remained
   undetected until now due to the secretive habits of burrow-nesting
   seabirds and the low number of genetic studies conducted. Received 15
   October 2008, accepted. 10 April 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Skin collections show that. the Shandong coast of China used to harbor a
   breeding population of the Chinese Crested Tern, Thalasseus Bernsteini,
   in the 1930s. However, the current status of this Critically Endangered
   population is poorly documented. From June to July 2006 a survey was
   conducted along the southern Shandong coast. The results; suggest that
   the species has likely been extirpated. The extirpation of the regional
   breeding population may have resulted from anthropogenic colonization
   and development on the breeding islands starting during the 1950s.

   Madeiran Wall Lizards (Teira dugesii). In the same year and in 2007, the
   phenomenon was further examined and samples of 78 and 153 nests,
   respectively, were followed. Also, non-systematic visits were made to
   other nests. A total of 40 episodes of lizards depreciating Cory's
   Shearwaters hatchlings was recorded. This hitherto unknown Source of
   predation for this shearwater accounted for the failure Of four (5.1\%)
   study nests in 2006 and eight (5.2\%) study nests in 2007. All recorded
   predation cases took place either during or shortly after hatching.
   Also, non-systematic observations indicated that three other species of
   burrowing petrels (Bulwer's Petrel, Bulweria bulwerii; Madeiran
   Storm-peurel, Oceandroma castro; White-faced Storm-petrel, Pelagodroma
   marina) were preyed upon by Madeiran Wall Lizards. Predation by lizards
   is apparently a phenomenon of lesser concern for Cory's Shearwaters but}},

Abstract = {{The Kittlitz's Murrelet. (Brachyramphus brevirostris) is a poorly-known
   species of alcid and a seabird of conservation concern. Nesting
   murrelets were discovered at Agattu Island in the western Aleutian
   Islands, and a field study provided new information on nest site
   selection, chick growth rates and reproductive success. Twelve ground
   nests were located in upland habitats (441 masl) at inland areas of
   Agattu (2.3 km from shore). All nests contained one egg or chick.
   Murrelets tended to nest in association with a ground cover of orange
   crustose lichens, bare ground, small rocks and graminoids. Estimates of
   growth rates for the body mass of nestling Kittlitz's Murrelets were
   lower (K-L < 0.10) than published estimates for other small-bodied
   alcids with semiprecocial young (K-L = 0.14 to 0.23). Murrelet young
   departed from nests after 30 days of growth at 47\% of adult mass but at
   80\% of adult wing length. Optimal wing-loading may ensure successful
   dispersal flights from terrestrial nest sites to ocean habitats.
   Survival of eggs and young were low during the incubation (0.26; 30 d)
   and brood-rearing periods (0.22; 30 d), leading to a low probability Of
   nest Survival (0.06). Losses during incubation were mainly due to avian
   predators, whereas mortality of young after hatching was caused by
   inclement weather. Kittlitz's Murrelets have a suite of life-history
   traits associated with low reproductive potential (small clutch size,
   slow growth and poor reproductive success) and may have limited ability
   to recover from population declines. Received 27 February 2008, accepted

Abstract = {{Field-collected and hunter-donated ducks obtained during
   September-January of 1997-98 and 1998-99 were used to determine if food
   habits and body mass of Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) and Mallards (A.
   Platyrhynchos) wintering in Suisun Marsh (Suisun), California, a managed
   estuarine brackish marsh, differed from values in the adjacent
   Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (the Delta), a freshwater region of
   grain fields flooded after harvest. Ducks in Suisun fed primarily oil
   seeds of Sea Purslane (Sesuvium verrucosum), followed by Alkali Bulrush
   (Schoenoplectus maritimus) and Wild Millet (Echinochloa crusgalli),
   together forming 73-90\% (aggregate \% dry mass) of the diets. Ducks in
   the Delta fed primarily on seeds of Smartweed (Polygonum spp.), followed
   by corn (Zea mays) and tomato seeds (Lycopersicon esculentum), together
   forming 62-88\% of the diets. Pintails and Mallards collected in Suisun
   each had similar (5 of 11 seasonal comparisons) or greater (6 of the 11
   comparisons) body mass compared to their conspecifics collected front
   the Delta (90\% confidence interval analyses), despite a composite diet
   in the Delta having about 39\% greater metabolizable energy content (ME)
   and 24\% greater protein content than in Suisun. Therefore, diet quality
   alone was not a predictor of body mass in these two areas. Other factors
   must have been involved, such as greater food abundance and density,
   lower waterfowl abundance and density, or lower daily energy costs in
   Suisun. Direct measurement of these factors should explain the apparent
   inconsistencies in body mass relative to food quality in these brackish
   and freshwater habitats. Received 28 June 2008, accepted 23 February
   2009.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and
   fish in a constricted shallow basin near a cormorant nesting site (Young
   Island) in Lake Champlain, Vermont were studied. Much of the basin was
   dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), which led to the
   investigation of how fish residing among SAV could affect cormorant
   foraging. Data were collected on foraging flocks, individual birds and
   their stomach contents, the fish comm unity, and SAV from May to
   September. Fish were most abundant in August and September; they did not
   migrate from the basin during the warmest time periods or the greatest
   densities of SAV. Although many fish species (N=28) were collected,
   Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) numbers comprised almost half of the
   fish community and were the major prey, based on numbers, in cormorant
   stomachs. Double-crested Cormorants regularly foraged in the basin until
   early August When they began foraging in more distant areas. The shift
   occurred soon after the peak in SAV biomass and height, which covered
   essentially the entire area previously frequented by foraging birds. The
   results indicate that. cormorants expand their foraging range when prey
   become less available. Thus, dense SAV can indirectly contribute to the
   expansion of Double-crested Comorants, adding complexity to strategies
   for managing cormorant numbers throughout the lake. Received 17 April
   2008, accepted 19 March 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variation in abundance, time activity budgets and foraging
   behavior of non-breeding Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa) and Willets
   (Tringa semipalmata) were compared at four sites at the Laguna Ojo de
   Liebre-Guerrero Negro saltworks complex, Baja California, Mexico.
   Habitat use varied between species, seasons and sites. Marbled Godwits
   (182 +/- 44.1 individuals per site) were more abundant than Willets (70
   +/- 16.1 individuals per site), reflecting their overall pattern in
   northwestern Mexico. Overall abundance diminished throughout the season
   (270 69 individuals per site in Oct-Nov, 85 +/- 21 in Dec-Jan and 60.2
   +/- 24 in Feb-Mar), although it remained high at mudflat. Consistent
   with bill length, Willets foraged mostly by pecking, while Marbled
   Godwits did so mostly by probing (proportion of pecks: 0.95 +/- 0.17 and
   0.4 +/- 0.27, respectively). Marbled Godwits changed their time activity
   budgets through the wintering season: time devoted to vigilance changed
   from 8-23\% in Oct-Nov, to 0.4-8\% in Feb-Mar whereas time devoted to
   feeding changed from 12-40\% in Oct-Nov to 59-74\% in Feb-Mar. This
   pattern seems to reflect a change in priorities; Surviving early in the
   season and accumulating energy to migrate, later. In both species,
   differences in use of habitat appeared to be related to site
   characteristics such as substrate hardness and risk of predation. The
   mudflat was the site most used and the saltmarsh, the least used. Some
   individuals in both species used the more risky saltmarsh, but increased
   the time devoted to vigilance. Thus, habitat quality for non-breeding
   shore-birds depended on both benefits and costs for foraging birds, and
   habitat choice by specific individuals was complex and probably involved
   condition- or state-dependent tradeoffs that balanced metabolic
   requirements, safety priorities, and, perhaps, social status or
   dominance. Received 10 September 2008, accepted 30 November 2008.}},

Abstract = {{The Boat-billed Heron's (Cochlearius cochlearius) atypical bill has
   inspired a half-century of literature addressing its possible ecological
   and evolutionary implications. Based on a review of this literature and
   results of a field Study conducted in San Blas, Mexico, it can be
   concluded that the Boat-billed Heron is nocturnal, visually-feeding,
   with a limited and simple feeding repertoire and diet. The heron forages
   by standing on branches and roots and by walking slowly in shallow water
   capturing fish and shrimp by lunging and by scooping the surface of the
   water with its bill. Except for scooping, the feeding repertoire is
   unexceptional and moreover is typical of other herons that feed by
   perching on low-hanging branches. Similarly, its food is similar to
   other nocturnal herons feeding in the same place. Herons obtained about
   60 prey items per clay. Thus the outlandish bill appears not to be
   detrimental to the bird's foraging successfully in a manner typical of
   herons using similar habitat. The bill has been shown to be used in
   social signaling, which may be its primary contemporary function. Based
   on available information the exceptional bill of the Boat-billed Heron
   appears to have few, if any, systematic or ecological implications.

Abstract = {{The Lava Heron (Butorides straita sundevalli) is a distinctively
   dark-plumaged heron that feeds along the rocky intertidal shoreline of
   the Galapagos Islands. The open shoreline used by the Lava Heron differs
   markedly from the dense swamps used by, most populations of Butorides
   Larva Herons feed by standing and by walking slowly at the water's edge,
   averaging only three steps per minute and catching primarily fish, crabs
   and prawns. Lava Heron foraging is characterized not only by, its use of
   open shoreline, but by an extreme dependence oil standing feeding
   behavior, frequent shifting of feeding sites following the tidal flux
   across a broad intertidal zone, and importance of crabs in the diet; but
   overall its foraging does not differ significantly from that used by
   Butorides elsewhere. The fundamental Butorides foraging strategy appears
   to have accommodated the habitat shift from dense bushes to open
   shoreline. Individuals maintain separate feeding territories, with the
   nest being placed within the territory of one of the pair. Feeding
   success was 0.12 prey per minute. In that nesting production is low
   contrasted with other populations, it appears that food may overall be
   limiting. The Galapagos population differs from South American Striated
   Herons (Butorides striata striata) in having a longer and stouter bill,
   a feature that correlates with the importance of crabs in the diet.
   Although known for its distinctive dark color, plumage ranges from all
   black to light grey, similar to South American birds. The dark color has
   been assumed to provide Camouflage against the similarly colored
   shoreline, but its specific function has not been explained. Dark
   ventral plumage likely provides camouflage from active fish and crab
   prey. Dark dorsal plumage likely provides camouflage oil the dark
   shoreline from above. Although the Galapagos lacks predators, four bird
   species steal prey from herons, suggesting that the dark plumage of Lava
   Herons may function to provide camouflage against piratical birds.
   Whereas the complex plumage patterns of most Butorides populations
   renders those birds cryptic within their usual densely vegetated
   habitat, dark plumage is similarly cryptic along the exposed dark
   shoreline of the Galapagos. Received 29 August 2008, accepted 15

Abstract = {{Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) have been identified as a
   species of concern by government agencies and conservation organizations
   because they have small populations and are sensitive to disturbance
   caused by shoreline and near-shore human activity. Expanding human
   recreation in Prince William Sound (PWS) may have potential negative
   consequences on Black Oystercatcher reproduction and on the population
   as a whole. Almost 2000 kin of shoreline in western PWS was inventoried
   to assess density, distribution and habitat use of breeding Black
   Oystercatchers each June and July from 2001 to 2004. These efforts
   identified 94 territories (density 0.03-0.38 pairs/km). Black
   Oystercatcher territories were preferentially located on wave-cut
   platforms and rocky islets as well as gravel beaches but they avoided
   salt marsh, tide flats and sheltered rocky shores. Within western PWS
   186 shoreline campsites were documented and people preferred to camp on
   gravel beaches. The association between campsites and territories was
   evaluated, and although there was a positive correlation at the
   landscape level, direct overlap only occurred on four sites and
   territories were separated from campsites, on average, by 1.8 km.
   Impacts associated with direct overlap (e.g., trampling of nests or
   direct displacement of pairs) may be rare for this remote area. Received

Abstract = {{Little is known about tire ecology and population structure of the
   Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens). Furthermore, the effects of the near
   extirpation on genetic variation of Reddish Egrets are unknown. A
   223-base-pair region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was
   sequenced in 149 Reddish Egret samples from sixteen breeding colonies
   along the Texas Coast to investigate genetic diversity and population
   structure. Despite experiencing a severe reduction in population size,
   Reddish Egrets retained a moderate amount of haplotype (0.705) and
   nucleotide diversity (0.005). A mismatch distribution among haplotypes
   and non-equilibrium relationship between the number and similarity of
   haplotypes (Fu's Fs) are consistent with historical population size
   changes. No evidence of genetic structuring was found among either
   colonies or color morphs. Reddish Egrets along tire Texas Coast. appear
   to form a single panmictic population. The results of this first
   conservation genetic study of Reddish Egrets serve as a foundation for
   management and additional research. Received 2 September 2008, accepted

Abstract = {{Dimorphism in various morphological traits is widely used to sex birds.
   However, when a threshold is set and there is overlap in the
   distribution of traits between sexes, there will be an error rate.
   Macaroni Penguins show limited sexual dimorphism in size, with the
   distributions of most phenotypic traits overlapping between sexes,
   making using morphological characters for sexing difficult, although
   bill depth is used ill one discrimination test. Two existing DNA-based
   PCR tests that use different primer pairs (P2/P8 and 2550/2781) were
   adapted for use with fluorescently labelled primers to enable the size
   of fragments to be accurately measured via genotyping protocols and sex
   to be determined. The two Molecular tests were applied to the same
   samples to estimate the error rate within and between tests. Whilst both
   primer pairs reproducibly identified the sex of the penguins tinder
   Study With 110 inconsistencies between tests, tire P2/P8 primer pair had
   a higher Success rate of amplification. To estimate the error rates of
   morphometric tests, they were compared with molecular tests, revealing
   areas of disagreement. Structure in the error indicated a bias near the
   morphometric discrimination threshold. We suggest that larger sample
   sizes in discriminant function analyses and calibration with molecular
   data can be used to estimate the likelihood of misidentification for any
   particular value of the trait. A description of where error lies can
   then be used to target the more expensive and time-consuming DNA tests
   to check individuals that are most likely to be mis-assigned. Received
   15 September 2008, accepted 9 January 2009.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 124 pellets (regurgitated casts;) produced by the Neotropic
   Cormorant (Phalacrocorax olivaceus) were collected monthly between
   January 2004 and November 2005 from a roosting site at Rosario Lake
   Chubut, Patagonia, Argentina. Analyses of the samples showed that fish
   were the most frequent and important prey by number, followed by
   crustaceans and molluscs. The three fish species inhabiting Rosario Lake
   were represented in the diet which suggests that this bird is a
   generalist feeder. However, cormorants positively selected for
   Patagonian Silverside and Rainbow Trout, which might be related to their
   foraging strategy and/or to the conspicuousness of potential prey. The
   estimated annual fish intake by cormorants at. Rosario Lake ranged
   between 2.3-3.7 tons of fish or 16,000-26,000 individuals. The impact
   produced by the Neotropic Cormorant on recreational fish resources and
   local fish farms appears negligible. Received 29 May 2008, accepted 17

Abstract = {{The Phoenix Petrel (Pterodroma alba) is classified as Endangered and its
   Population is declining on most of its breeding islands. However, the
   exact population size is not clearly known and data are sometimes old
   and inaccurate, such as for the Marquesas Archipelago, French Polynesia.
   Hatuta'a Island, Marquesas, was visited for three days in March 2007 to
   determine whether P. alba was still breeding on this island. The
   population size was estimated to be more than 200 pairs, compared with
   the one individual seen 20 years ago. Thus, Hatuta'a's importance for
   bird conservation in the region has increased. Received 2 January 2008,

Abstract = {{The Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle) is a monomorphic, socially
   monogamous member of the Alcidae. Although aspects of their breeding and
   foraging ecology have been extensively studied, less is known about
   possible sex-based differences in morphology, nor whether Black
   Guillemots mate assortatively based on body size. Using molecular
   techniques, we identified the sex of 26 male and 21 female Black
   Guillemots captured ill the Canadian Arctic, and measured six external
   body measurements: outer tarsus length, wing length, culmen length, bill
   depth, head plus bill length and body mass to test for sexual size
   dimorphism (SSD) and assortative mating. Overall, males were 1.7\% and
   8\% larger than females in outer tarsus length and bill depth,
   respectively. Within breeding pairs, bill depth was the most dimorphic
   trait. Despite these morphological differences no evidence of
   assortative mating based upon body size was found. Thus, mate choice for
   body size does not appear to be all underlying mechanism of SSD in bill
   depth in Black Guillemots. Received 23 September 2008, accepted 23

Abstract = {{Nest site choice and construction by ground-nesting shorebirds can have
   important repercussions for survival and reproductive success,
   potentially impacting predation risk, mate retention and hatching
   success. One such decision, lining nests with shell fragments, was
   investigated in the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). Data were
   collected describing the placement, construction and fate of 34 nests on
   Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA in 2003. Model selection criteria were used
   to determine the habitat variables that. most strongly influence nest
   lining. The best model included variables related to both the immediate
   surrounding (proportion of the substrate made up of shell and rock, and
   sand granularity), as well as nest location (distance from the dune).
   Plovers used more shell fragments in nests that are on shelly, rocky, or
   coarse-sanded beaches, and when nesting closer to dunes. There was a
   negative correlation between fledging success and the amount of shell
   surrounding the nest. These results and related conservation
   implications are explored for this threatened shorebird. Received 13

Abstract = {{The first late Oligocene fossil record of a loon (Gaviiformes) is
   described from the lacustrine deposits of the German locality Enspel.
   The specimen is all isolated foot, which is associated with a
   crocodilian tooth. The fossil belongs to a species about half the size
   of the smallest extant loon, and is morphologically most similar to the
   Paleogene taxon Colymboides. In all probability it constitutes the prey
   remains of a crocodilian, which is of particular significance because
   the distribution ranges of loons and crocodilians hardly overlap today.
   The Enspel palaeoclimate was warm-temperate and subtropical, and the
   Enspel specimen and other Palcogene fossils of gaviiform birds raise
   the, as yet, unanswered question of why loons largely disappeared from
   inland habitats of the warmer regions. Received 22 July 2008, accepted

Abstract = {{A framework for a sampling plan for monitoring marshbird populations in
   the contiguous 48 states is proposed here. The sampling universe is the
   breeding habitat (i.e. wetlands) potentially used by marshbirds.
   Selection protocols would be implemented within each of large
   geographical strata, such as Bird Conservation Regions. Site selection
   will be done using a two-stage cluster sample. Primary sampling units
   (PSUs) would be land areas, such as legal townships, and would be
   selected by a procedure such as systematic sampling. Secondary sampling
   units (SSUs) will be wetlands or portions of wetlands in the PSUs. SSUs
   will be selected by a randomized spatially balanced procedure. For
   analysis, the use of a variety of methods as a means of increasing
   confidence in conclusions that may be reached is encouraged. Additional
   effort will be required to work out details and implement the plan.}},

Abstract = {{A large proportion of the Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica) spending
   the boreal winter along the eastern Pacific Ocean coast are known to
   occur in the vicinity of Chiloe Island, Chile, but the importance of the
   region to Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) is less known. Ground counts
   conducted in 2007 and 2008 increased published estimates, at a minimum,
   of Pacific coast populations by 27\% for Whimbrels (33,150 individuals)
   and 51\% for Hudsonian Godwits (21,161 individuals). Bays and shorelines
   in the Chiloe Island region supported 99\% of Hudsonian Godwits and,
   perhaps, 61\% of Whimbrels estimated to occur along the Pacific coast
   during the boreal winter. Whereas Hudsonian Godwits aggregated in
   shallow bays on the eastern and northern coast of Chiloe Island,
   Whimbrels were more dispersed along the island's coastline and reached a
   density of 7.5 birds/km along sheltered gravel shorelines. Bays in the
   vicinity of Chiloe's capital, Castro, provided important foraging and
   roosting habitat for non-breeding birds; these sites supported 52\% of
   the Pacific coast population of Hudsonian Godwits and >4,000 Whimbrels.
   Low human disturbance in Pullao and Putemun bays makes these sites
   particularly attractive to non-breeding Hudsonian Godwits, and their
   permanent protection is urged.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{225-233}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of spatial and temporal variation in species richness,
   abundance and diversity were evaluated in eight wetlands in
   Central-South Chile in relation to nine wetland characteristics.
   Twenty-six bird species were recorded, among the most representative
   families were Rallidae, Ardeidae and Anatidae with five species each.
   Step-wise regression analyses identified wetland area and water level
   fluctuations as the most important variables determining bird abundance.
   Variations in species richness were explained by wetland area, shoreline
   length, vegetation cover and water-level fluctuations. Shoreline
   development, shoreline length and wetland area lower than one-teeter
   depth were especially important in determining species diversity.
   Cluster analyses showed similar results. Shoreline length was an
   important feature influencing total species number, but simple
   regression analysis showed that the species area relationship occurs in
   wetlands too. This study concludes that species richness, bird abundance
   and diversity reach higher values in larger and structurally more
   heterogeneous wetlands, but with important seasonal dynamics in
   waterbirds. The relationships between habitat characteristics and
   community structure did not remain unchanged throughout the year,
   suggesting that the birds respond differently to one or another habitat
   characteristic depending on the season. These results show the need for
   wetland conservation in Chile, paying special attention to the largest
   and most heterogeneous wetlands to conserve the greatest species
   richness and bird abundance.}},

Abstract = {{A study, using satellite telemetry, was conducted to determine the
   precise migration patterns and wintering locations of Common Loons
   (Gavia immer) breeding in the northeastern United States. Transmitters
   were implanted in 1 7 loons (16 adults and one juvenile) that were
   captured on breeding lakes in New York, New Hampshire, and Maine during
   the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005. Transmitters from ten of the birds
   provided adequate location data to document movement to wintering areas.
   Most adult loons appeared to travel non-stop from breeding lakes, or
   neighboring lakes (within 15 km), to the Atlantic coast. Adult looms
   marked in New Hampshire and Maine wintered 152 to 239 km from breeding
   lakes, along the Maine coast. Adult loons marked in the Adirondack Park
   of New York wintered along the coasts of Massachusetts (414 km from
   breeding lake), Rhode Island (362 km), and southern New Jersey (527 km).
   Most of the loons remained relatively stationary throughout the winter,
   but the size of individual wintering areas of adult loons ringed front
   43 to 1,159 km(2), based on a 95\% fixed kernel utilization distribution
   probability. A juvenile bird from New York made a number of stops at
   lakes and reservoirs cn route to Long Island Sound (325 km front
   breeding lake). Maximum functional life of transmitters was about 12
   months, providing an opportunity to document spring migration movements
   as well. This work provides essential information for development and
   implementation of regional Common Loon conservation strategies in the
   Northeastern U.S.}},

   Foraging Habitat in Northwest Ecuador}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of wading birds is increasingly dependent upon
   determining the ability of human-modified habitats to serve as
   surrogates for natural habitats. The suitability of commercial shrimp
   farms and seminatural estuarine mudflats in Northwest Ecuador as
   foraging habitat for wading birds was assessed by observing the foraging
   efficiency, diet and behavior of Great (Ardea alba) and Snowy (Egretta
   thula) Egrets, censusing wading birds, and measuring prey availability
   (i.e. prey density, standing crop, water depth and diversity). Mean
   annual wading bird density, was greatest in shrimp ponds, but was
   greater on mudflats during the breeding season when energy, demands are
   most critical. Foraging efficiency (capture/strike) was greater on
   average in shrimp ponds than on mudflats, and both Great and Snowy
   Egrets captured significantly larger prey items (in both length and
   mass) there than on mudflats. However, intake rates (g/minute) were
   significantly greater on seminatural mudflats than in shrimp ponds
   during the breeding season. Prey standing crop, mass of individual prey
   items and water depths were all significantly greater in shrimp ponds
   than on mudflats, while the opposite was true for prey density anti
   diversity. Shrimp ponds provide important foraging habitat for Great and
   Snowy Egrets, particularly during harvest events anti during the
   non-breeding season, while four other wading bird species (Tricolored
   Heron (Egretta tricolor), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea),
   Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea) and Striated Heron
   (Butorides striatus)) were precluded from foraging in most ponds due in
   part to deeper water (>30 cm), pond bathymetry, larger prey items and
   differing foraging behaviors. While important to Great and Snowy Egrets,
   shrimp ponds do not appear to provide suitable foraging habitat for all
   other diurnal wading bird species within the local community, and do not
   likely serve as complete ecological substitutes for natural foraging
   habitat throughout coastal Ecuador.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out on breeding Horned (Slavonian) Grebes (Podiceps
   auritus) in Scotland to investigate causes of low breeding success.
   Clutch and brood survival were examined separately, as well as overall
   breeding success. For those clutches where the cause of loss was known,
   most were lost to avian predators. Clutch survival teas negatively
   correlated with crow (Corous spp.) frequency and variability in water
   levels. Brood survival was lower where the introduced fish species, Pike
   (Esox lucius) was present and higher where the water was clearer. These
   factors may have affected predation rates and foraging efficiency,
   respectively. Overall productivity (young fledged per pair) was
   negatively related to the frequency of crows and number of bank anglers,
   who can disturb grebes. Remains of 19 fully-grown birds were found at
   five lakes. Some had been skinned and dismembered in a similar way,
   suggesting predation by a mustclid. Steps to improve productivity should
   include education of bank anglers, and perhaps selective removal of Pike
   and crows. Alternatively, breeding habitat could be improved at lakes
   where predators are less common.}},

Abstract = {{Since their recovery from population declines in the 1960s and 1970s,
   Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) have become a common breeder on
   the Atlantic coast of the southeastern U.S.A. Despite their relative
   abundance, few studies of their breeding biology have been conducted in
   this region. Parent and nestling behavior during early chick rearing
   were examined at a colony in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Rates of
   parental and chick feeding decreased linearly with chick age. Rates of
   parental attendance, chick begging and chick aggression all peaked when
   chicks were approximately 21 d post-hatching and then declined. Direct
   feeding events were never observed when chicks were < 11 d of age and
   indirect feeding events were rarely observed after chicks were > 15 d of
   age. The transition from indirect to direct feeding was not accompanied
   by a change in begging rates. Shifts in the frequencies of both parent
   and chick behaviors occurred at approximately three weeks post hatching,
   when chicks achieve thermoregulatory independence and become more
   mobile. These data suggest that any spatial or temporal comparisons of
   parent or chick behavior should be assessed in relation to the age
   category of the parent and the age of the chicks.}},

Abstract = {{Nest-site selection and nest success for Red-breasted Mergansers (Mergus
   senator) breeding on a barrier island complex (Tern Islands) with
   >10,000 Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) in eastern New Brunswick, Canada,
   were studied in 2005 and 2006. Concealment was the most important
   feature for nest placement as 153 of 156 nests were in dense stands of
   Marram Grass (Ammophila breviligulata), and overhead concealment,
   vegetation density and vegetation height were all greater at nests than
   at random locations. Apparent. success for all nests was 57\% and was
   similar between years. Few nests were depreciated (N = 3), but
   abandonment was responsible for 95\% of nest losses and was most common
   early in the season. Nest success was <45\% for nests initiated before
   25 May but >75\% for nests initiated after 10 June. Nest. abandonment
   was influenced by intraspecific nest parasitism and investigator
   activity. Red-breasted Mergansers selected nest sites adaptively on Tern
   Islands because: 1) nests were more concealed than random sites; 2)
   avian predation at nests in the Common Tern colony was lower than at
   nests on nearby islands without terns; 3) nests were not exposed to
   mammalian predators; and 4) nest success and nest densities were high.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial proportion, perhaps 30\%, of the North American breeding
   population of Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) winter in the
   vicinity of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. These birds spend the night
   on Nantucket Sound and commute during daylight hours to the Nantucket
   Shoals, which extend about 65 km offshore from the southeastern corner
   of Nantucket. Strip transects done from a single-engine plane in 1997
   and 1998 indicated that Long-tailed Ducks foraged over the shallower (<=
   20 m depth) portions of the Nantucket Shoals, up to 70 km offshore. Diet
   analyses of ten birds collected in February 1999 and five in December
   2006 showed that they fed principally (106.6 +/- 42.0 individuals per
   crop) on Gammarus annulatus, a pelagic amphipod that often forms large
   aggregations, and is consumed by several species of fish and marine
   mammals. Our findings emphasize the importance of conservation of the
   Nantucket Shoals and the prevention of oil spills or other potentially
   harmful accidents.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotope analyses have revolutionized the study of migratory
   connectivity. However, as with all tools, their limitations must, be
   understood in order to derive the maximum benefit of a particular
   application. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
   stable isotopes of C, N, H, O and S for assigning known-origin feathers
   to the molting sites of migrant shorebird species wintering and breeding
   in Argentina. Specific objectives were to: 1) compare the efficacy of
   the technique for studying shorebird species with different migration
   patterns, life histories and habitat-use patterns; 2) evaluate the
   grouping of species with similar migration and habitat use patterns in a
   single analysis to potentially improve prediction accuracy; and 3)
   evaluate the potential gains in prediction accuracy that might be
   achieved front using multiple stable isotopes. The efficacy of stable
   isotope ratios to determine origin was found to vary with species. While
   one species (White-rumped Sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis) had high
   levels of accuracy assigning samples to known origin (91\% of samples
   correctly assigned), another (Collared Plover, Charadrius collaris)
   showed low levels of accuracy (52\% of samples correctly assigned).
   Intra-individual variability may account for this difference: in
   efficacy. The prediction model for three species with similar migration
   and habitat-use patterns performed poorly compared with the model for
   just one of the species (71\% versus 91\% of samples correctly
   assigned). Thus, combining multiple sympatric species may not improve
   model prediction accuracy. Increasing the number of stable isotopes in
   the analyses increased the accuracy of assigning shorebirds to their
   molting origin, but the best combination - involving a subset of all the
   isotopes analyzed - varied among species.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury exposure may he linked to several sources of variation related
   to habitat conditions and species ecology. In generalist birds, feeding
   habits may change quickly in response to environmental conditions, prey
   availability and individual requirements. Stable: nitrogen isotope
   ratios (delta(15)N) were used as a marker of trophic level, and stable
   carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) as a marker of carbon sources
   (terrestrial vs. marine) in food webs involving waterbirds, to infer the
   effect oil mercury exposure dice to differences in feeding ecology and
   the relative dependence em aquatic environments. Four generalist species
   occupying three different habitats were examined during the breeding
   season. Habitats: Brackish Water-saltwater (saltpans), brackish
   water-freshwater (ricefields anti some saltpans) and terrestrial
   environment (steppes). Species: Avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta),
   Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Kentish Plover (Charadrius
   alexandrinus) anti Cattle Egret (Bulbucus ibis). Chick feathers were
   collected at several locations between 2000 and 2003. Species used
   resources differently ill the environment, and distinct pathways were
   involved in the mobilization of mercury into food webs. The positive
   relationship between leather delta(15)N values and mercury levels
   indicated mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Inter-specific
   variation in feather delta(13)C values revealed a different relative
   dependence among species on terrestrial vs. aquatic prey. Intra-specific
   variation in feather delta(13)C values also indicated differential use
   of marine inputs within each species, and within saltpans for Avocet
   chicks. Feather mercury levels and delta(13)C values suggested that the:
   relative use of marine-derived prey influences mercury levels in chicks.}},

Title = {{Molted Feathers as a Source of DNA for Genetic Studies in Waterbird
   Populations}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{322-329}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The determination of genetic parameters for most waterbird populations
   presents considerable challenges because these species frequently breed
   in inaccessible locations which preclude capture of nesting pairs. The
   application of non-invasive sampling techniques, such as the collection
   of molted feathers in the field, could represent an appealing strategy
   to overcome the above cited problem. Here, the feasibility of sampling
   molted feathers collected in Brazilian populations of the Roseate
   Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja; N = 94) and the Jabiru Stork (Jabiru
   mycteria; N = 10) for genetic studies was evaluated. Each feather
   yielded high quality DNA with a concentration 1.25 tunes higher than
   that obtained from feathers from similar sized birds from other groups.
   Amplification of a 390396 by fragment for molecular sexing and 11
   microsatellite loci was successful. The average percentage of positive
   PCRs (i.e. those that. yielded products) among all Roseate Spoonbill
   loci and samples was 95.5\%. The sampling approach appears suitable to
   gather genetic information in natural populations of these waterbirds
   and can be applied to other similar species.}},

Abstract = {{Cats (Felis catus) were probably introduced to Reunion Island (Western
   Indian Ocean) in the seventeenth century and feral populations are now
   spread over all anthropogenic and native habitats. The diet of feral
   cats living in the breeding habitat of Barau's Petrel (Pterodroma
   baraui), an endemic and threatened seabird of Reunion Island, were
   studied. Results from the analysis of 217 scat (333 prey items) showed
   that Barau's Petrel were the most common prey of feral cats, followed by
   introduced rodents. Numerous dead birds at breeding colonies that had
   been killed by cats were found, 58\% of the birds were adults. Given the
   high sensitivity of the population growth rate of a long-lived seabird
   to any additive mortality of adults, these results are particularly
   worrying. As this species is also threatened by massive light-induced
   mortality of fledglings, it. is highly likely that this population is
   declining. A control of cats at breeding colonies is urgently needed to
   save this species from extinction.}},

   highest in a zone where several river months and coastal lagoons
   occurred. The most common species, each accounting for >5\% of all
   individuals observed, were in decreasing order of abundance: Spotted
   Sandpiper (Actitis macularius), Sanderling (Calidris alba),
   Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Collared Plover (Charadrius
   collaris). Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), Whimbrel (Numenius
   phaeopus), and Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus). Species
   composition differed between autumn and spring by 42\%. For all surveys
   a total of 2,673 individuals was recorded, and flock size ranged from 2
   to 35 birds, indicating that. Puma de Manabique is a secondary migration

Abstract = {{Colonization pattern, clutch size variations and nest mortalities were
   studied in a wild population of Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) in
   Delhi Zoo, India during 2005-2006. Among the seven different colonies in
   the zoo, colony 3 was the first to be occupied in both years. Nest
   initiation dates were significantly different. across colonies.
   Initiation dates of satellite colonies were 7-15 days later than the
   island colonies (16-19 August). Clutch size varied among different
   colonies (1.41-3.04) with colonies 3 and 4 exhibiting highest values,
   3.04 and 2.70 respectively. Birds nesting early (<14 days since nest
   initiation date) had higher clutch sizes compared to later nesters and
   those nesting in satellite colonies. House Crow (Corous splendens) and
   Black Kite (Milvus migrans) were the major predator on eggs and clicks.
   The significance of site specific studies in providing conservation
   insights and setting the foundation for long teen population monitoring

Abstract = {{This study made at Dumfries SW Scotland has revealed new information on
   the ecology Ind social structure of an urban colony of Lesser Black
   backed and Het-ling Gulls Larus fuscus and L argentat us There has been
   a decline in the numbers of gulls nesting in Dumfries contrary to a
   national tiend of increasing numbers These gulls nested socially and
   almost invariably had another pair within 100 m Recruitment uas almost
   totally confined to existing groups and new breeding areas were
   initiated by forming roosting groups on suitable sites High density
   groups were formed on flat roofs usually on industrial and commercial
   properties while low densities pairs occurred in residential areas and
   these pairs usually nested on chimney stacks From 2000 to 2007 the
   public subjected nesting gulls to appreciable and increasing non lethal
   disruption mainly by nest and egg removal This halved the overall
   breeding success and resulted in increased movement of nesting sites
   between years However at sites not subjected to management breeding
   success Was high and movement was significantly lower On low density
   sites nest removal and proofing against nesting gulls mainly resulted in
   pairs moving a short distance and did not reduce the numbers nesting in
   the immediate area In contrast synchronous removal of nests and eggs (or
   the prevention of bleeding by netting or demolition) at high density
   nesting sites caused desertion of the site In the next breeding season
   most of these displaced gulls failed to nest neat by resulting in an
   appleciable reduction in density of gulls nesting in the immediate area
   Further the gulls did not move as group elsewhere within the town It is
   believed than many either failed to breed in the year after disruption
   cm permanently emigrated horn the town an interpretation that is
   supported by two other studies Surpiisingly few of the gulls that had
   their eggs and nest removed re laid in that breeding season These
   findings should be used to form the basis of non lethal m management of
   urban nesting gulls which should be planned on an experimental basis to
   confirm and quantify the results from Dumfries Received 29 February 2008

Abstract = {{Ground based censuses of shorebirds were conducted during the winters of
   2000-2008 (even years only) and the springs of 2002 2004 and 2008 at
   Estero Santa Cruz Sonora Mexico a 3 622 ha coastal wetland at the Gulf
   of California between the Colorado River Delta and Bahia Santa Maria and
   Ensenada Pabellones Sinaloa We documented 21 shorebird species using
   Estero Santa Cruz Winter species richness averaged 13 (SD = 2 range 11
   16 species N = 8) while the spring species richness averaged eleven (SD
   = 2 range 8-16 species N = 15) In all censuses Calidris spp-primarily
   Western Sandpiper (C mauri) was the most abundant species group
   accounting for up to 91\% of daily abundance in both winter and spring
   varying between 60- 91\% in winter and 34-92\% in spring The highest
   winter daily count of calidrids was 3 485 while the spring high count
   was 7 095 The two highest single day counts were the latest dates
   censused (10 April 2004 9 April 2008) suggesting that the peak of spring
   migration comes later and thus that peak shorebird abundance in the
   estero is higher than our censuses have recorded Estero Santa Cruz and
   other estuaries geographically intermediate between larger shorebird
   staging areas and migratory bottlenecks represent important migratory
   stopover sites Such sites allow for flexibility in migratory pathways
   and thus deserve conservation attention and management Received 17

   colonies of Royal (Sterna maxima) and Sandwich (S sandivicerists) Terns
   in three mid Atlantic States are reported Nest census data were gathered
   spotadically in North Carolina Virginia and Maryland throughout this
   period Royal Tern chick counts based on annual banding efforts were
   obtained in Maryland since 1975 and North Carolina and Virginia since
   1977 while Sandwich Tern chick counts date from 1977 in North Carolina
   and 1980 in Virginia Roval Tern chick counts shou significant annual
   variation by state and are posan eh correlated between North Carolina
   and Virginia but negatively correlated between Maryland and both North
   Carolina and Virginia Sandwich Tern nest counts showed magnificant
   annual variation in North Carolina as did chick counts in North Carolina
   and Virginia These results suggest regional lather than local trends in
   Royal Tern numbers oyer time While Royal Tern numbers indicate a gradual
   decline in nests and chick production since the 1980s followed by an
   increase in recent years Sandwich Tern numbers hay e remained
   consistently lower than Royal Terns but stable over the entire study
   period Causes for the decline in Royal Tern numbers are attributed
   primarily to loss of open sandy habitat from vegetational use cession at
   breeding sites on dredged material Islands and to invasive species at
   nesting sites including quadraped predators Increased habitat management
   and regular censusing with consistent methodology are recommended to
   help maintain these species at sustainable levels Received 27 November

Abstract = {{The Atlantic Coast population of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) has
   been the focus of range wide monitoring and recovery efforts since it
   was listed as Threatened in 1986 pursuant to the US Endangered Species
   Act Breeding pairs in the U S and Eastern Canada were censused annually
   from 1986 through 2006 and productivity (chicks fledged per breeding
   pair) was reported annually for varying proportions of the population
   Census totals more than doubled from 790 pairs in 1986 to 1749 pairs in
   2006 concomitant with sustained intensive management Population growth
   was greatest and most rapid in the Ness England and New York New Jersey
   recovery units while increases were more modest in the Southern and
   Eastern Canada units Periodic rapid declines in the Southern and Eastern
   Canada units raise concerns about long term risks of extirpation The
   Atlantic Coast population became less evenly distributed between 1989
   and 2006 with the percentage of the population breeding in New England
   increasing from 21 5\% to 36 2\% while declining proportionately in the
   other three recovery units Overall productivity for the Atlantic Coast
   population 1989 2006 was 1 35 chicks fledged per pair (annual range = 1
   16-1 54) and overall productivity within recovery units decreased with
   decreasing latitude Eastern Canada = 1 61 New England = 1 44 New York
   New Jersey = 118 and Southern = 119 Within recovery units annual
   productivity was variable and showed no sustained trends There were
   significant positive relationships between productivity and population
   growth in the subsequent year for each of the three U S recovery units
   but not for Eastern Canada There was a latitudinal trend in predictions
   of annual productivity needed to support stationary populations (lambda
   = 1 0) within recovery units increasing from 0 93 chicks fledged per
   pair in the Southern unit to 1 44 in Eastern Canada These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that survival rates of Atlantic Coast
   Piping Plovers decline with increasing latitude of breeding sites and
   suggest that modified productivity objectives that are specific to
   individual recovery units may be appropriate Received 11 October 2007

Abstract = {{The Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) is threatened species in Canada
   under the Species at Risk Act and breeds in manmade impoundments on
   Department of National Defence 1 and in Nicolet/Baie-du Febvie Quebec a
   designated Migratory Bird Sanctuary We conducted Least Bittern call
   bioadcast surveys in duce adjacent basins in these impoundments from
   2004 to 2006 Least Bittern abundance greatly fluctuated between these
   years with maximum of 37 Individuals in 2004 16 in 2005 and increasing
   to 32 individuals in 2006 translating into 38 18 and 31 estimated
   breeding pairs A breach in a dyke occured on the larger basin in the
   fall of 2004 where e most Least Bitterns were detected which decreased
   the water level of the marsh and altered the habitat structure the
   following spring The dyke was repaired in the fall of 2005 followed by a
   significant increase in the water level The fluctuating Least Bittern
   abundance observed during these years suggests a rapid response of the
   local population to Inter annual changes in water level and habitat
   structure Water level management may be necessary to ensure long term
   ecological integrity of artificial wetlands but management activities
   should be conducted outside the bleeding sea son to ensure that the
   Least Bittern s reproductive needs lie fulfilled Received 19 December

Abstract = {{A Horned Screamer (Anhima cornuta) population was studied to examine its
   conservation status and habitat deterioration in the El Canclon Lagoon
   wetland (Manglales Churtat Ecologic Reserve) at coastal Ecuador from
   February 2001 to January 2002 Weekly censuses were conducted along 100m
   transects uotind the lagoon pc `mete' in five survey areas showing
   diffeient degree of perturbation during the dry and wet seasons At least
   68 screamers were observed in the lagoon The abundance of screamers was
   lower (six ten individuals) in more disturbed areas containing farms
   agriculture fields and cattle ranching Abundance was inset sely
   associated with the presence of cattle and was not seasonally dependent
   during the dry and wet seasons Screamers were significantly associated
   with vegetation coverage Because the Horned Screamer strongly relies on
   the wetland vegetation cattle ovelgrazing jeopardizes its habitat and
   survival in this Ramsal wetland Best management practices and the
   establishment of buffei zones (1 e 100m) are needed to mitigate the

   Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) in the Playa Lakes Region (PLR) of

   month during the wet 2002 Dining 2002 after hatch year (Arm males had
   more carcass fat (g and percent) than did AHY females Likewise AHY males
   had 34\% more carcass fat (g) than hatch year (HY) males but we did not
   detect differences between AHY and HY females The average increase in
   carcass fat (g) from October to November December during wet 2002 was
   26\% for males and 42 to 93\% (HY) for females Body condition of
   pintails in the south exceeded those captured in not them subregions of
   the PLR during wet 2002 but not dry 2003 Southern caught AHY males had
   31\% more carcass fat (g) than northern caught AHY males but we found no
   differences for HY males Females caught in southern subregions also had
   24-77\% more carcass fat (g) than northern captured females During dry
   2003 pint ill carcass fat (g and \%) did not vary by capture location or
   among age and sex classes except for males which increased carcass fat
   by 34\% between capture periods From our findings we recommend that
   managers periodically assess pintail body condition to detect temporal
   trends of condition status and measure population response to
   concentration efforts However use of body condition measures to evaluate
   habitat management and conservation effort is must be evaluated in the

Abstract = {{We analyzed carcass lipid ash and protein dynamics of male and female
   Wilson s Snipe (Gallinago gallinago dehcata) from arrival on wintering
   areas in coastal Texas until departure for spring migration In addition
   we analyzed seasonal variation in mass and length of digestive organs to
   document changes that may increase gut capacity and digestive efficiency
   of migrating and wintering Wilson s Snipe Lipid reserves of female snipe
   remained relatively stable from fall to winter whereas body protein
   increased by 3\% during this time Females catabolized lipids and protein
   prior to spring migration Conversely lipid reserves of male snipe
   increased by 44\% from fall to winter and were at least maintained from
   winter to spring Furthermore we observed a trend (P = 0 021) for in
   creasing lipid content in males during spring Because male snipt
   accumulate fat reserves prior to spring departure it appears they employ
   a ``time-selected{''} strategy for spring migration In contrast female
   snipe migrate later in spring when food may be more available Thus
   females apparently rely more on dietary nutrients acquired at migration
   stopover sites to and likely employ an ``energy selected{''} strategy
   for spring migration Gut morphology of male snipe remained unchanged
   throughout the non breeding period whereas length of small intestine
   caeca and large intestine decreased by 6\% 8\% and 8\% respectively from
   fall to winter in females Small intestine length in creased by 6\% in
   females from winter to spring Received 4 March 2008 accepted 5 July 2008}},

Abstract = {{Little information exists on breeding Greater Sandhill Cranes (Grus
   canadensis tabida) in riparian wetlands of the Intermountain West We
   examined the nesting ecology of Sandhill Cranes associated with riparian
   and palustrine wetlands in the Henry s Fork Watershed in eastern Idaho
   in 2003 We located 36 active crane nests 19 in riparian wetlands and 17
   in palustrine wetlands Nesting sites were dominated by rushes (funcus
   spp) sedges (Carex spp) Broad leaved Cattail (Iypha latifolia) and
   willow (Sahxspp) and adjacent foraging areas were primarily composed of
   sagebrush (Artemiszaspp) cinquefoil (Potentillaspp) Rabbitbrush
   (Ericameria bloomeri) bunch grasses upland forbs Quaking Aspen (Populus
   tremuloides) and cottonwood (Populus spp) Mean v ater depth surrounding
   nests was 23 cm (SD = 22) A majority of nests (61\%) were surrounded by
   vegetation between 30-60 cm 23\% by vegetation <30 cm and 16\% by
   vegetation >60 cm in height We were able to determine the fate of 29
   nests of which 20 were successful (69\%) Daily nest survival was 0 986
   (95\% LCI 0 963 UCI 0 995) equivalent to a Mayfield nest success of 0
   654 (95\% LCI 0 324 UCI 0 851) Model selection favored models with the
   covariates vegetation type vegetation height and water depth Nest
   survival Increased with Increasing water depth surrounding nest sites
   Mean water depth was higher around successful nests (10 cm SD = 21) than
   unsuccessful nests (15 cm SD 22) Further research is needed to evaluate

Abstract = {{During a time of food stress, we observed sex-biased mortality during
   the nestling stage in a sexually size dimorphic species of wading bird,
   the White Ibis (Eudocimus albus). Over four days spread out over a week,
   we captured a total of 180 25-32 d old White Ibis nestlings from a
   colony of several thousand breeding pairs. On sequential capture dates
   we caught significantly fewer females than males. Through this time
   period male nestlings had higher body condition indices (mass/tarsus)
   than females, though the rates at which male and female body condition
   increased over the week were not significantly different. Several
   sources of evidence suggest that our sampling was not sex-biased and was
   reflective of actual changes in abundance of males and females. These
   data indicate that despite the greater caloric requirements of males,
   their larger size may have conferred a competitive advantage over female
   siblings in obtaining food from parents during a time of food shortage.

   American Avoet Wilson s Phalaropes and Lesser Yellowlegs generally

Abstract = {{The foraging and cluing behavior of the Cleat Glebe (Podicephorus major)
   was studied in southern Brazil from June to October 2005 A total of 547
   dives performed by adult birds and 578 discs of juveniles were recorded
   There was no age related difference in dive duration (adults = 19 43 s
   Juveniles = 20 00 s) but the time ellipsed between two successive dives
   (pause cm recovery time) differed among age-classes (adults = 16 1 s
   juveniles = 150 s) Duration of due and pause times were weakly
   correlated in adults and not correlated in Juveniles Both age classes
   had feeding bouts of similar durations Adults were more efficient in
   capturing prey (0 2 prey/min) in comparison with juveniles (0 1
   prey/min) and took significantly larger prey The main food Item was the
   White Croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) an abundant fish in the area
   Juveniles had higher pie) handling time in comparison with adults (78 2
   s vs 20 1 s) making them mole pone than adults to being
   eleptoparasitized by other seabirds Diving duration varied during
   daytime bows with juveniles diving longer during early morning and late
   afternoon while adults avoided foraging during midday bolus Feeding
   throughout the day could be a mechanism used by juvenile grebes to
   compensate lot low Imaging efficiency Received 3 April 2007 accepted 11

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first record of the Green Heron (Butorides
   virescens) nesting on the oceanic islands of Bermuda Nesting was first
   documented in 2002 nests were first found in 2003 From 2005 2007 the
   Green Heron nesting population was about 20 pairs located at as many as
   seven sites dispersed over most of the islands It is likely that the
   Green Heron nested on Bermuda for sonic years immediately before its
   discos cry Are new of available information suggests that it may have
   nested also on Bermuda in pre-colonial times possibly even into the
   historic period During the stud) period oyer 80 young have fledged at
   the two main nesting sites Green Herons on Bermuda eat small fish at
   inland ponds and marshes and along the coast This paper also provides
   the first published description of the occurrence in 1985 1990 of the
   Striated Heron (Butorides striata) on Bermuda Colonization of the Green
   Heron followed private and gevernment engagement in wetland conservation

   urdus merula (all road casualties) As expected the Dipper had fat mote
   down and contour feathers (3 322) than the Blackbirds (mean 1 704) with
   Dipper down and contour feathers being significantly shorter than those
   of Blackbirds However contrary to published information the plumage of
   dippers is not exceptionally dense the mean follicle density of the
   Dipper was 59 2 follicles cm 2 that of the Blackbirds 58 6-61 7
   follicles cm(2) Instead the enhanced insulation of diving Dippers stems
   from a) much more extensive plumage (the apterylae between feather
   tracts are fully feathered whilst naked in Blackbirds) b) substantial
   down cover of head (absent in Blackbirds) c) extensive down coy er of
   wings Much of the higher number of feathers in the Dipper is made up of
   contour feathers rather than down/semiplume feathers (the ratio between
   Dipper con tour and down/semiplume feathers 3 35 I was similar to that
   of Blackbirds 355 1) indicating an insulative e function for contour
   feathers as well as down Ultrastructural investigation showed that

Abstract = {{Red footed Boobies (Sula sula) belong to the Sulidae family and the
   order Pelicaniformes and are expected to present low rates of extra pair
   paternity (EPP) due to several life history traits of scabirds We found
   no evidence of EPP among 14 families of Red footed Boobies nesting on
   Genovesa Island in the Galapagos archipelago using multilocus
   minisatellite DNA markets The band sharing values between patents and
   offspring ranged from 0 44 to 086 and those among unrelated individuals
   ranged from 0 07 to 0 4 all bands in offspring lanes were at counted for
   by those in the lanes of the putative parents Received 25 January 2008

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Depth recorders are among the most useful tools available for
   ornithologists Interested in waterbird foraging behavior Despite their
   widespread use in the literature there is little information available
   about their precision and accuracy including for the case of TDRs device
   drift We examined the uncertainty associated nab two types of depth
   recorders deployed on Thick billed Muries Uria lomvia in the Canadian
   Arctic in 2007 for up to 48 hours The maximum depth obtained by
   capillary tube maximum depth gauges (MDGs) a cheap and simple depth
   recorder was highly col I elated (R(2) = 0 87) with maximum depth
   obtained by electronic time-depth recorders (TDRs) attached to the same
   bird (n = 29) up to depths of 100 in Deeper than 100 m or in deployments
   of 144 hours MDGs wet e unreliable We suggest that the maximum depth for
   Thick billed Murres in the Canadian Atcuc is about 150 in rather than
   the 210 meters previously reported using MDGs recorders and that caution
   should be used when quoting maximal maximum depths for species diving
   deeper than 100 m using this method We also attached two Lotek TDRs to
   the same bird (n = 18) and examined the similarity of the two recorders
   The average age difference increased from about 0 5 m near the surface
   to about 1 0 m below 60 m with extreme differences of up to 4 m obtained
   Furthermore TDRs submerged to known depth were accurate within +/- 2m
   The effect of these variations on measurements of maximum and average
   depth and duration was about 0 6-1 3 m (depth) or s (dura non) which is
   similar to the manufacturer s accuracy specifications (+/- 1\%) Finally
   ne examined the drift (offset from zero at the surface) within the TDRs
   Drift varied from 2 5 to + 2 m with 9 out of 36 recorders showing no
   drift and no change amongst years for individual recorders Drift was
   lowest (most negative) at the colony higher during flight and highest
   (most positive) on the water surface despite very small differences in
   altitude (<50m) We suggest that drift may be a useful tool for
   quantifying at sea behavior especially in conjunction with temperature
   logs We conclude that MDGs are reliable up to 100 m and within 48 hours
   and that TDRs are precise within +/- 2\% but that more research needs to
   be completed on device accuracy and precision Received 4 March 2008

Abstract = {{Brandt's Cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) breeding effort,
   phenology and success were studied in 1997-2001 at three colonies
   spanning approximately 200 kin of the central California coast: Point
   Reyes (PR); Devil's Slide Rock and Mainland (DS); and Castle-Hurricane
   Colony Complex (CH). Breeding effort was reduced at all three colonies
   in the 1998 El Nino event. Mean clutch initiation dates differed
   significantly among colonies, with cormorants at the southernmost colony
   (CH) laying earliest, and those at the northernmost colony (PR) laying
   latest. Productivity at individual colonies varied greatly among years
   (range 0.7-2.5 fledglings per pair). Overall colony means were lowest
   (1.6 fledglings/pair) during the 1998 El Nino event and highest (2.5
   fledglings/pair) in the 1999 La Nina event. Productivity at CH (1.7
   fledglings/pair) was significantly lower than at PR (2.2
   fledglings/pair), and interannual variation was greatest at CH.
   Late-nesting birds laid fewer eggs, hatched fewer chicks, and fledged
   fewer chicks per pair than early-nesters. The rapid rate of growth at
   some nearshore colonies in central California suggests immigration from
   elsewhere, most likely the large offshore colony at the South Farallon
   Islands. Variation in timing of breeding and reproductive success among
   colonies demonstrates a value in maintaining multiple Study locations
   when assessing Brandt's Cormorant Population parameters in the
   California Current System. Received 27 June 2007, accepted 26 November

Abstract = {{This study quantifies the relative importance of factors affecting
   selection of brood-rearing areas by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima)
   according to duckling age. A total of 1,431 h of observation was
   conducted from June-August On the New Brunswick mainland in 2000 and on
   Grand Manan Island in 2001. The number of breeding pairs of Great
   Black-backed Gulls (Larus matinus) on colonies near study sites appeared
   to be a better predictor of duckling abundance in sites than the number
   of Common Eider nests on those colonies. Neither degree of exposure of
   site nor availability of rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) explained
   variations in duckling abundance. However, sites with a gradual slope,
   which offer increased surface-feeding area, supported 43-85\% more
   ducklings than sites with a steep slope. Rockweed-harvested sites with a
   steep slope supported the least number of ducklings on Grand Manan
   Island, and duckling numbers on the mainland decreased faster in
   harvested than in control sites. Predation was unimportant, with only
   nine successful predator attacks on ducklings occurring. Of those, Bald
   Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were responsible for six duckling
   losses. However, Common Eiders may have avoided Herring Gulls (L.
   argentatus) in duckling-feeding sites, possibly to avoid
   klepto-parasitism on eiders by gulls. Human disturbance was also a minor
   factor. Received 17 September 2007, accepted 3 July 2008.}},

Abstract = {{King Rail (Rallus elegans) populations are listed as threatened or
   endangered in 13 states. One remaining area of relative abundance is the
   rice-growing region of southwestern Louisiana. Rice fields are flooded
   for much of the year and support thick emergent vegetation, potentially
   providing high-quality habitat for King Rails. The objectives of this
   study were to determine: 1) relative nest density of King Rails in rice;
   2) which local and landscape factors influence relative nest densities;
   3) nest survival of King Rails in rice fields; 4) effectiveness of
   callback surveys in indicating King Rail breeding activity; and 5) site
   occupancy of King Rails in rice fields. In the summers of 2004 and 2005,
   King Rail surveys and nest searches were conducted in Cameron, Jefferson
   Davis, Vermilion, and Acadia Parishes in southwestern Louisiana. In
   2004, 42 fields were searched for nests and 30 of those were surveyed
   with callback survey techniques. In 2005, 40 fields were searched and 60
   were surveyed. A total of 77 King Rail nests was found, and relative
   nest density was between 3.4 and 4.8 nests/km(2). The highest nest
   densities were in fields with a high proportion of irrigation canals
   around the perimeters and a low proportion of trees. Nest survival wits
   similar to 50\% in both years. Most survey responses were detected in
   June, and survey detections were correlated with nest abundance. Site
   occupancy was estimated as 0.35 +/- 0.11 in 2004 (no estimates for 2005)
   from callback surveys and between 0.4 (2004) and 0.5 (2005) from nest
   searches. Callback surveys were an effective technique for monitoring
   King Rails in this region. Given high nest survival rates and apparently
   stable nest densities, rice fields appear to provide high-quality
   habitat for King Rails in southwestern Louisiana.}},

Abstract = {{Flight patterns of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta
   thula) arriving at and departing two mixed-species colonies were studied
   in Wichita, Kansas, in May and June 2007. For 137 short-distance flights
   (about 200 in) at one colony, flight duration and flight distance were
   recorded and wing beats were counted. For 90 longer flights (about 1,200
   in) at a second colony, flight durations were recorded. From these data,
   wing-beat frequencies and flight velocities were calculated, then wind
   vector addition was used to determine airspeeds and examine the effects
   of wind velocity and wind direction on flight-patterns. Using published
   algorithms and data from two of our previous flight line studies, the
   daily energetic Costs of foraging flights were estimated. Flight.
   patterns by Great Egrets and Snowy Egrets showed sonic similarities. For
   example, mean air speeds for Great Egrets (9.2 m/s) did not differ from
   those of Snowy Egrets (8.7 m/s). Differences between species included
   lower wing-beat frequencies by Great Egrets and a much stronger effect
   of headwinds on Snowy Egret flight velocities. Energetic requirements
   for flight also differed between species, which are ascribed to
   differences in wing-loading and mass. The cost of an average flight for
   each species was estimated, and daily flight costs were compared to
   overall daily energy budgets. Flight comprised 25.9\% of the total
   energy budget for Great Egrets and 27.5\% for Snowy Egrets. Based on
   previous foraging Studies, a Great Egret can meet its daily energy
   requirements for flight after an estimated 82 min of foraging, whereas a
   Snowy Egret must forage for 168 min to capture enough prey to meet the
   daily demands for flight. This study represents the next stage in our
   development of annual time-and-activity budgets for these two species of
   wading birds. Received, 18 November 2007, accepted 2 May 2008.}},

Abstract = {{The Peruvian Tern (Sternula lorata) is one of the rarest seabirds that
   breed on the barren desert plains of Peru and Chile. Unlike the majority
   of seabirds breeding in this region, Peruvian Terns nest in open areas
   on the mainland, where they are exposed to attacks by predators, mainly
   foxes (Pseudalopex spp.). Here, we describe the Peruvian Tern's breeding
   biology and examine its ecological adaptations to counteract high
   predation rates from data collected during the 1970s and 1990s at four
   localities in central-southern Peru: Puerto Viejo (12 degrees 34'S),
   Pampa Lechuzas (13 degrees 53'S), Yanyarina (15 degrees 26'S) and
   Mellendo (17 degrees 04'S). Egg-laying was asynchronous both within and
   among breeding groups, spreading from mid October to late January. Modal
   clutch size was two eggs, which were incubated for 22 d. Weight
   increment for two chicks during the linear section of the growth curve
   was 2.27 and 2.54 g/d. A complete body weight growth curve for one chick
   was fitted to the logistic equation with K(L) = 0.193 d(-1), A = 50.66 g
   and t(i) = 9.9 d. The proportion of nests that hatched at least one
   chick at Puerto Viejo varied from complete failure in 1971-72 to 80\% (N
   = 6 nests) in 1973-74. Birds did not attempt to breed during El Nino
   1972-73. Low nest density (five to seven nests/km(2)), absence of nest
   material, camouflage of eggs and chicks, and high mobility of chicks few
   days after hatching are traits that may decrease nest detection by
   predators. Conversely, presence of landmarks such as clusters of stones,
   shell chips, tire tracks and broken glass close to the nest probably
   enhance nest. location by parents in the featureless environment of the
   desert. Prey remains found in the nests were seven to eight. cm Peruvian
   Silversides (Odonthestes regia regin) and Mote Sculpins (Normanichthys
   crockeri). The breeding biology and nesting strategies of Peruvian Terns
   are very similar to the closely-related Damara Tern (Sternula
   balaenarum) from the coast of South-western Africa and may have evolved
   to reduce high rates of mammalian predation. Received 27 November 2007,

Abstract = {{In South America, Royal Terns (Thalasseus maximus maximus) and Cayenne
   Terns (Thalasseus sandvicensis eurygnathus)breed mostly in Argentina and
   Brazil. Royal Terns have been recorded in at least 22 locations (six in
   Brazil and 14 in Argentina). Cayenne Terns have been recorded in at
   least 38 locations (15 in Brazil and 23 in Argentina). At 15 locations,
   mostly located in Argentina, Royal and Cayenne terns breed in
   association, often with their nests intermingled. Total population size
   for Royal Terns was estimated in at least 750 pairs in Brazil and less
   than 5000 in Argentina, while that of Cayenne Tern was estimated in at
   least 8000 pairs in Brazil and less than 10000 in Argentina. However,
   lack of counts at some coastal sectors and changes among breeding sites
   between seasons preclude an accurate estimation of total population size
   for both species and make spatial management challenging. Main threats
   faced by their populations in both Countries are human disturbance,
   fisheries, egging, and expanding Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus)
   populations. Priority research and conservation actions are presented.

Abstract = {{Fledgling counts are often used to estimate fledgling production or
   calculate air index of chick survival (i.e., fledging Success) in the
   Least Tern (Sterna antillarum). Timing of counts is critical because
   numbers of fledglings present may be influenced by temporal patterns in
   fledgling departures front colonies and post fledging mortality. The
   objectives of the present study were to measure chick survival and
   fledgling residence time (FRT) at three Least Tern colonies in Maine and
   examine the accuracy of single or multiple counts of fledglings for
   estimating fledgling production and fledging Success. Chicks were
   color-banded at age zero to one d in 2002-2003 to estimate chick
   survival using mark-resighting methods and to examine relationships
   between fledging date and FRT. Colony sites were searched for banded
   chicks and fledglings every one to three d from just prior to fledging
   until their disappearance front the vicinity of nesting areas at three
   colonies. Data oil numbers of banded fledglings known alive oil each
   survey date were used to simulate single or periodic counts of banded
   fledglings for the purpose of comparing estimates of fledgling
   production and success based oil count on methods with known values.
   Chick survival estimates were 0.7.1, 0.74, and 0.14 for the three
   colonies. Fledgling residence times decreased relative to fledging date
   at all colonies, and the trend for maximum values of FRT, which may be
   an indicator of the maximum time to departure, varied from approximately
   30 d in mid-July to 15 d in early to mid-August. The highest one-d
   counts of fledglings underestimated fledgling production by 21-30\% for
   the two sites with high chick survival. Methods based on multiple counts
   also tended to underestimate fledgling production. Fledgling residency
   patterns limit tire Utility of count methods for estimating fledgling
   production and fledging success. Received 4 March 2005, accepted 3

Abstract = {{Feeding activity of wintering Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) was
   conducted in Southwest Greenland. Behavioral observations were made at
   two wintering sites, a fjord habitat and an outer coastal habitat, at
   which habitat characteristics and human activities differed
   considerably. In the coastal area where hunting and fishing was common
   and foraging typically occurred 0.5 to one km from the shore eiders were
   identified as primarily diurnal feeders. They also foraged during
   twilight periods, but only rarely at night. In constrast, in the fjord
   where human disturbance was rare and foraging occurred very close to the
   shore (< 50 m) adult ciders fed only during twilight and at flight.
   During daytime, birds gathered in large communal roosts in open water
   away front feeding areas. Occasionally, feeding was initiated by
   juveniles during daytime, but was discontinued due to interactions with
   White-tailed Eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla groenlandicus) and suggests
   that nocturnal feeding is an anti-predator mechanism. More experienced
   adult birds in the fjord did not attempt feeding during daylight hours.
   Large Communal roosts observed at deep waters during previous aerial
   surveys suggest that nocturnal feeding maybe common throughout the
   fjords in Southwest Greenland. Received 10 January 2007 accepted 1 April

Abstract = {{Selection of a foraging site entails costs and benefits which are
   reflected in survival and reproductive success. We studied Piping Plover
   (Charadrius melodus) foraging-site selection during the breeding season
   (2001-2003) On the Missouri River and examined the relationship between
   site selection and invertebrate abundance indices within habitats.
   Foraging adult plovers selected protected shoreline (inter-sandbar
   channels, inlets, and backwater areas) more often than expected based on
   availability (use: 92\% +/- 3\%; availability: 58\% +/- 5\%).
   Invertebrate biomass and numbers along exposed shoreline did not. differ
   among reaches. Along the protected shoreline, invertebrate biomass and
   numbers were higher below a dam with an epilimnetic release and a
   relatively constant release rate (epilimnetic reach) than at the other
   two reaches. On the epilimnetic river reach, invertebrate biomass and
   numbers were higher along the protected shoreline than on the main
   channel shoreline. On a reach below a dam with a hypolimnetic release
   and diel flow pulse (hypolimnetic reach) and a cold water reservoir,
   invertebrate indices were similar on the protected and exposed
   shoreline. Invertebrate numbers were higher in saturated and moist
   habitats than in vegetated and dry habitats (P < 0.05). At the
   epilimnetic and hypolimnetic reaches, foraging Piping Plover chicks used
   saturated and moist habitats more than vegetated and dry habitats, based
   on availability. On the Missouri River, protected shorelines were
   important foraging sites for Piping Plovers during the breeding season,
   and sandbars with low-lying moist habitat were important to foraging
   chicks. Piping Plovers will benefit from increased availability of these
   habitats on managed or created sandbars on the Missouri River. Received

Abstract = {{Populations of egrets and other waterbirds in the Murray-Darling Basin
   of eastern Australia arc declining. River regulation and increasing
   frequency of droughts are considered to be mainly responsible by
   reducing the frequency and extent of flooding to temporary wetlands.
   However, other changes have occurred to wetlands, such;is the
   introduction of non-native fish, widespread severe declines in the
   abundance of native fish, increased salinity, sediment and nutrient
   concentrations, and removal of aquatic vegetation by livestock grazing.
   Current knowledge of the diets of egrets is inadequate for an assessment
   of any ecological implications arising from these changes. In this study
   the breeding season diets of Eastern Great Egret Ardea modesta and
   Intermediate Egret A. intermedia were quantified at a colony in the
   Murray Basin. Eastern Great Egrets depended mainly oil introduced Common
   Carp Cyprinus carpio (94\% of diet biomass), a species regarded as a
   severe pest of river systems and wetlands within the Basin. Attempts to
   eliminate carp, without adequate restoration of native fish populations,
   Could result in further long-term declines in egret breeding success and
   survival. Intermediate egrets depended mainly oil adult and larval frogs
   (80\% of diet biomass), species that are under threat from habitat
   degradation and predicted increases in the salinity of freshwater
   wetlands. A holistic approach to the restoration of wetlands, involving
   the integration of improved flooding regimes, pest fish management and
   reinstatement of native fish and amphibians, salinity control and
   restoration of aquatic vegetation will be needed to ensure the future of
   egrets and other fish-eating birds in the Murray-Darling Basin. Received

Abstract = {{The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has
   elevated concerns about wild birds as virus hosts; however, little is
   known about the ecological and epidemiological factors of transmission
   by shorebirds. Here we summarize results for 2,773 shorebirds that were
   live-trapped oil the Pacific coast of the United States during 2006-2007
   and tested for avian influenza virus using real-time reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation. As
   was the case throughout North America, HPAI H5N1 was not detected in
   shorebirds during this interval. Contrary to other wild bird groups,
   most notably waterfowl, the prevalence of even low pathogenicity virus
   among shorebirds in our study areas in California, Washington, and
   Alaska was extremely low (0.5\%). Virus was detected by RT-PCR from four
   different species, including, Dunlin (Calidris alpina; N = 3), Western
   Sandpiper (C. mauri; N = 8), Long-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus
   scolopaceus; N = 1), and American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana; N =
   1), With the detections in the latter three constituting the first
   published records for these birds. Based oil studies in the eastern
   United States, we expected, but did not detect (H(1) = 1.6, P = 0.21)
   elevated avian influenza prevalence among shorebirds during spring
   migration. Diagnostic tests, which were designed to evaluate testing and
   sampling methods, indicated poor functioning of traditional virus
   isolation methods and no improvement in detection likelihood by
   collecting oropharyngeal swabs in addition to cloacal swab samples for
   low pathogenicity viruses (Z(1) = 0.7, P = 0.48). Received 18 December
   2007, accepted 29 April 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Prey consumed by breeding Pacific Gulls (Larus pacificus) were
   identified and quantified oil seven islands in the Furneaux Group, Bass
   Strait, Australia, over the 2003/04 austral summer to examine temporal
   and spatial variation in dietary preference. Non-invasive dietary
   sampling involved collection of non-consumed parts of prey (large
   particles) and regurgitated pellets of prey remains (pellets) from
   feeding platforms every two weeks. Of the 128 prey items identified, 17
   of these items were prominent in the diet of Pacific Gulls. Of these,
   seven were identified by both large particles and pellets of prey
   remains, three only as large particles and the remaining seven only in
   pellets. PRIMER Multidimensional scaling revealed differences between
   stages of breeding and between sites in the abundance of each type of
   prey found as large particles, but only between sites for prey found in
   pellets. Based oil the relationship between body mass and dietary
   requirements a breeding adult Pacific Gull requires, oil average, 600
   kJ/d over the breeding season. This study identified prey corresponding
   to only 193 35 kJ/d which equates to a total biomass of approximately
   1,000 kg of prey being consumed by the 108 breeding Pacific Gulls, or 19
   kg per breeding pair. Results were biased toward hard-bodied prey, and
   hence, this research failed to identify 90\% of the food consumed by the
   Pacific Gull Population. Caution is advised against one-off sampling in
   time and space, and using Simple techniques, to examine dietary
   preference in gulls. Received 23 August 2007, accepted 2 March 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike conspecifics in the subantarctic region, which typically begin
   breeding in mid-spring to summer, Common diving-petrels Pelecanoides
   urinatrix urinatrix in southeastern Australia (towards the northern
   limit of the species' distribution) commence breeding mid winter.
   Knowledge of the foraging ecology of this species is crucial to
   understanding the factors that influence its timing of breeding in the
   region, yet there is currently little information available. Analysis of
   43 stomachs of breeding adults, collected opportunistically after they
   were killed in a fire which burned through their colony, indicated that
   their diet was dominated by two taxa: a euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis
   which comprised 87\% of the diet by number: and a hyperiid amphipod
   Themisto australis which constituted a further 12.5\%. Mean lengths (+/-
   SE) of N. australis (n = 39) and T. australis (n = 41) were 12 turn (+/-
   0.3) and 5.2 mm (+/- 0.2), respectively. The importance of N. australis
   in the diet of Common Diving-petrels is discussed in relation to their
   timing of breeding and the euphausiid's potential role in the Bass
   Strait pelagic ecosystem. Received 8 December 200 7, accepted 2 May

Abstract = {{Many Neartic shorebirds migrate to South America for the non-breeding
   season, and use several key stopover and wintering sites along the
   Atlantic coast. However, there is little information about annual
   shorebird use along the northeast coast of Brazil. This year-long study
   examined the seasonal Occurrence and abundance of shorebirds at Atalaia
   Nova beach in Sergipe State, Brazil. Of the 13 species recorded, the
   most abundant were Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus),
   Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), and Sanderlings (Calidris
   alba). Highest numbers occurred between September and March, and the
   lowest numbers occurred between April and August. Some species were
   present throughout the year. Atalaia Nova beach is an important

Abstract = {{East China is a very important wintering region for many migratory
   waterbirds, but many species have suffered large population declines
   over recent decades. However, the limited information available oil the
   current and historical abundances of waterbirds in tire region Seriously
   limits our ability to assess the magnitude of these declines. The first
   comprehensive count of tire complete Fujian coastline, conducted over a
   three-week period in February 2006, provided the opportunity to compare
   data from this count with historical information on waterbird abundances
   along the Fujian coast obtained during the second half of the 1800s and
   early-1990s. Our count total of nearly I 10,000 birds of 65 species
   shows that the Fujian coast is still very important for waterbirds
   during the wintering period. We obtained abundance comparisons for 28
   species of which 19 had declined greatly in the last 100150 years: four
   of these are globally threatened. The Anatidae group, in particular, has
   suffered seriously in diversity and numbers during the last century and
   this finding is consistent With observed decreases in breeding numbers.
   Given Population declines and the great importance of cast China as a
   wintering area for waterbirds (including some globally threatened
   species), all important priority should be to determine the current
   Status of the different species throughout. the region. This information
   will be useful ill proposing effective conservation measures including
   monitoring in east China. Received 28 August 2007, accepted 1 April

Abstract = {{Risk factors for predation attempts by Peregrine Falcons (Falco

   during fall staging in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, Odds of attacks may be
   expected to vary with a host of factors such as time of day, time of
   year, spacing within groups and weather conditions. During the ebbing
   tide, 65 surprise attacks by falcons were recorded over 596 observation
   periods. Two factors emerged as risk factors for predation attempts by
   Peregrine Falcons on Semipalmated Sandpiper flocks during four
   consecutive fall staging periods. Falcons initiated attacks more often
   on denser flocks and later during the migratory stopover. Year, time of
   day and weather factors did not influence attack rate. These findings
   may reflect lower anti-predator vigilance in denser groups and the
   greater numbers of sandpipers available in the later stages of stopover.
   Fitness consequences of these attacks remain to be established. Received

Abstract = {{Twelve colonies where the Red-legged Cormorant (Phalacrocorax gaimardi)
   breeds in Argentina were visited. Physical and biological
   characteristics were recorded at 29 nesting cliffs and at different
   sectors within cliffs. Forty-five percent of the cliffs were located on
   continental shores, the rest were on islands. Cliff height and length
   varied (mean height = 14 +/- 5 in, length range = 12 to 3,000 m) but
   their slope was commonly 80 to 90 degrees. Most cliffs had more than
   50\% of the total available area with apparent suitable breeding sites.
   Cliff length and available area was positively correlated with the
   number of nests. Forty-nine different sectors used by Red-legged
   Cormorant on the cliffs were identified. In those sectors, number of
   active nests was positively correlated and nest density negatively
   correlated with area. Highest median density of nests was NE in
   orientation, protected from predominant winds. Minimum average distance
   from the tide line to the closest nest group was positively correlated
   with both wave effect exposure (fetch in front of the sector) and cliff
   slope. Probability of occurrence of active Red-legged Cormorant nests in
   a sector increased with cliff slope. Forty-one percent of cliffs also
   had nests of the Rock Shag (Phalacrocorax magellanicus). For Red-legged
   Cormorant, cliff slope, orientation, available area and exposure to
   waves seemed important for nesting. Received 27 July 2007, accepted 23

Abstract = {{We used 19 years of mark-recapture/resighting data collected on 11, 020
   birds from 1988-2006 at five colony sites in Massachusetts, New York,
   and Connecticut, USA, to examine temporal variation in the survival
   rates of adult Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) during periods of
   overall population increase (1988-2000) and decline (2000-2006). Roseate
   Terns nested at only one colony site in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts at
   the start of this period, but two more sites in this area were
   recolonized as the study progressed. Adult survival rates varied
   temporally in overall population increase (0.835 +/- 0.006 SE) and the
   period of population decline (0.835 +/- 0.008 SE). As expected based on
   previous work, adult survival from 1991 to 1992 was lowered as a result
   of a severe hurricane in August 1991. An oil spill in Buzzards Bay in
   April 2003 did not appear to result in lower survival of the birds
   nesting at the variation in other vital rates of this species (such as
   postfledging survival) needs to be examined to determine the likely
   cause(s) of the recent population decline.}},

Abstract = {{Roseate terns are rare and restricted range breeders in NW Europe, with
   a population size of below 1,100 pairs and 95\% of these within four
   colonies. The apparent survival and breeding dispersal laws of adults
   was estimated from live resighting data collected at three of the
   largest colonies between 1995 and 2007. These parameters were estimated
   using a multi-stale model implemented in program MARK, with transition
   rates equating to breeding dispersal. The program U-CARE identified
   transience and trap-dependence in the data and so these effects were
   specified in the model. Time-averaged apparent survival rates were 0.735
   yr(-1) for birds during the interval following their first encounter and
   0.855 yr(-1) for ``older{''} birds. Survival varied among years but not
   colonies. Breeding dispersal rates varied among colonies, being highest
   towards the largest and most productive colony, intermediate in the
   reverse direction and lowest between the two smaller colonies. Since the
   largest colony is not en route to either of the smaller colonies this
   observation cannot be explained by the order in which birds encounter
   sites during spring migration, so we propose that birds either follow
   the bulk of birds migrating north in spring or choose to breed there
   after prospecting during the staging period of the previous year. The
   differences in numbers breeding at each colony, however, mean that the
   numbers moving in different directions among colonies broadly balance
   out, such that net movements in terms of the number of individuals
   involved are relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{Survival of tropical Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) from the western
   Indian Ocean was modeled using a capture-mark-recapture dataset of 102
   breeding adults ringed and resighted on Aride Island, Seychelles, from
   2002 to 2007. The effect of covariated reflecting oceanographic
   conditions and resighting effort was also examined during the modeling.
   A time-invariant survival rate was best supported by our data, with
   annual adult survival estimated at 0.807 +/- 0.033 (SE). Resighting
   probability was found to be influenced by sea-surface temperature (SST)
   anomalics, as expressed by the mean Indian Ocean Dipole mode index
   recorded during the nonbreeding period. Years of higher SST in the
   western part of the Indian Ocean in September-April (8 months)
   corresponded to a lower probability of resighting adults at the colony
   during the breeding season (May-August), which may be related to a
   tendency for some adults at the colony during the breeding season
   (May-August), which may be related to a tendency for some adults to
   refrain from breeding in less favourable years. Comparing our results
   with temperate studies, Roseate Terns breeding on Aride were found to
   exhibit similar survival estimates. Consequently, this study does not
   support the hypothesis that tropical Roseated Terns may counterbalance
   their lower fecundity (clutch size and breeding success) compared to
   their temperature and northern-hemisphere counterparts (Europe, North
   America, Caribbean) by relatively higher survival rates.}},

   is similar to estimates for the same species in North America. The
   Cormack-Jolly-Seber models used in program MARK to estimate survival
   rates also produced estimated of recapture probabilities and population
   sizes. These estimates of population size were 29,000 for S. D. bangsi

Abstract = {{This paper presents a summary of the four preceding papers and
   integrates them with previously-published data to compare demographic
   parameters of Roseate Terns breeding in tropical and temperate regions.
   Tropical Roseated Terns appear to breed less frequently than temperate
   birds and raise far fewer chicks to fledging when they do breed.
   Nevertheless, the three estimated of adult survival rates of tropical
   populations that were presented in this symposium are lower than those
   for temperate populations (0.71-0.82 yr(-1) vs 0.83-0.90 yr(-1)). Two
   estimates of juvenile survival (from fledging to age 1 or 2 years) of
   tropical birds are slightly higher than comparable estimates for a
   temperate population, but the differences are not sufficient to offset
   the lower productivity. Data on ages at first breeding are similar in
   the two regions. Given their irregular breeding and low productivity,
   the true regions. Given their irregular breeding and low productivity,
   the true survival rates of temperate Roseate Terns unusually low
   compared to other seabirds with similar life-history characteristics.
   This is partially offset by consistently high productivity, but the
   reported demographic parameters cannot account for the observed
   long-term increases in numbers of two well-studied regional populations.
   Despite intensive study of Roseate Terns in several parts of their world
   range during the last 25 years, important features of the demography of
   both tropical and temperature populations remain poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care behaviors often differ in dimorphic seabirds, leading to
   sex-specific differences in foraging behaviors. However, few studies
   have examined sex-specific foraging behaviors in monomorphic seabirds.
   Using radio-telemetry, we studied Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri)-a
   monomorphic and socially monogamons seabird-breeding in the South San
   Francisco Bay, California. Space use did not differ between males and
   females. Instead, space use varied by breeding stage and colony
   affiliation. Forster's Terns were located farthest from the nest during
   pre-breeding and post-breeding time periods, and closest to the nest
   during incubation and chick-rearing. Home-range size and core-use areas
   decreased as the breeding season progressed and were most concentrated
   in the post-breeding stage. The results of this and other studies
   indicated that terns, unlike other monomorphic sea-birds studies, do not
   exhibit sex-specific differences in space use.}},

Abstract = {{Female American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) were radio-marked (N =
   15) and tracked in the South San Francisco Bay, California, to determine
   if space use varied by breeding stage. Visual observations were used to
   determine breeding stage (pre-incubation, incubation, brood-rearing,
   post-breeding) of marked avocets. Space use measurements (linear
   movements, home ranges, core areas, and average distance from nest)
   varied significantly among breeding stages. Space use was greatest for
   the post-breeding stage, followed by pre-incubation, incubation, and
   brood-rearing. Most avocet nests (93\%) were located within their
   pre-incubation core area bound-aries, whereas only 36\% of nests were
   within post-breeding core areas. Distance between daily location and
   future nest sites decreased significantly as the number of days prior to
   incubation decreased, suggesting that avocets prospected future nest
   sites several weeks prior to nesting. These data indicate that breeding
   stage influences space use of female American Avocets and illustrates
   the importance of delineating breeding stage to better understand space
   use of avian species.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the composition and overlap in the chick diets of the two
   most abundant auks in the Northwest Atlantic, the Common Murre (Uria
   aalge, hereafter murres) and the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica;
   hereafter puffins). Our objective was to assess how auks with different
   foraging strategies (dietary specialization among murres vs.
   generalization among puffins) and physiological constraints imposed by
   differences in body size and prey-loading meet the energy demands of
   reproduction. Murres provisioned chicks with female capelin (> 100 mm):
   98.8\% by number in 2004 and 95.5\% in 2005. The relative contribution
   of gravid capelin to murre chick diets decreased by an order of
   magnitude between years (41.1 and 4.9\% by number in 2004 and 2005,
   respectively) and was related to the timing of capelin spawning. Puffins
   provisioned chicks with high proportions of forage fish in both years
   with the focal species changing from sandlance Ammodytes spp. in 2004
   (97.6\% by index of relative importance, IRI) to capelin (>100 mm) in
   2005 (92.3\% IRI). Murre fledglings were significantly higher in 2005
   (203.0 +/- 4.6 g) compared to 2004 (215.0 +/- 3.9 g) whereas puffins
   chicks exhibited no such differences. These results suggest that
   generalized feeding is a viable strategy for puffins but that
   specialized feeding by murres can lead to poor offspring condition when
   there is low overlap between peak food availability (i.e. capelin
   spawning) and chick-rearing.}},

Abstract = {{We documented the movement and distribution patterns of wintering Surf
   Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and White-winged Scoters (Melanitta
   fusca) in relation to herring spawn events in the Strait of Georgia,
   British Columbis. Radio-telemetry and surveys were conducted in Baynes
   Sound, an important wintering area where scoters feed primarily on
   clams. In early March, herring spawn events in areas adjacent to Baynes
   Sound provide a short-term pulse of abundant and easily accessible food,
   which could affect habitat use by wintering scoters from Baynes Sound.
   Radio-marked Surf Scoters and White-winged Scoters exhibited limited
   movements during winter, in contrast to the spring herring spawn season,
   when both scoter species moved greater distances to access herring eggs.
   Most individuals were located near spawning locations at least once
   during the spawning season, and the majority of telemetry locations were
   close to spawning sites, with Surf Scoters showing a higher association
   with spawn for both metrics. A marked decrease (66-98\%) in the
   abundance of both scoter species in Baynes Sound was observed coincident
   with spawn initiation in adjacent sites. We conclude that scoters
   altered their movement and habitat use patterns in spring to take
   advantage of herring roe, an energy-rich food source. This dramatic
   change in behaviour suggests that herring spawn may be of particular
   importance to these species.}},

Abstract = {{Migration chronology was quantified for 15 waterfowl species on 58 playa
   wetlands in the Southern High Plains of Texas from February 2004 through
   April 2006. Abundance of each species was estimated on playas once every
   two weeks during the nonbreeding season (16 August to 30 April);
   presence of ice was also recorded, Dabbling ducks were most common
   (N=250.668) and most tended to exhibit either a bimodal migration
   pattern (lower abundance in winter than during fall and spring passage)
   or a unimodal pattern (one defined peak). Abundance of the most common
   dabbling ducks was skewed toward late winter and spring. Most species of
   diving ducks (N = 15,128) tended to exhibit irregular migration
   patterns. Canada Geese (both Branta canadensis and B. hutchinsii, N =
   15, 347) had an abundance pattern that gradually increased, peaking in
   midwinter, and then decreased, which is typical for a terminal wintering
   area. Ice was most common on playas during the first half of December,
   which coincided with the lowest winter abundance in dabbling ducks. Data
   from this study will support management efforts focused on playa
   wetlands, including the development of population goals and habitat
   objectives that span the entire non-breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Nests of many over-water nesting birds are frequently subjected to wave
   action from repeated wind-storms. Colonial grebes often lose over 50\%
   of nests in any particular breeding season to wave action, depending on
   factors such as storm activity and habitat quality. We examined nest
   structure survival in a colony of Western Grebes (Aechmophorus
   occidentalis) in relation to wave action due to wind. Initial nests were
   66\% successful in hatching at Lake Christina, Minnesota, in 2005
   compared to only 48\% in 2006. in 2005, initial nests that survived and
   hatched young were closer to the central tuber-mat of the colony and
   closer to individual bulrush island centers prone to wave attack were
   less likely to last the season and produce young than were nests in
   central or more protected areas of the colony. Buffer zones stem density
   was less important than the amount of buffer between nest and wave
   attack, which may be a major factor colony founders select for when
   evaluating nest placement sites within a colony.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of waterbirds nest over-water in shallow lakes and marshes
   in the Northern Plains region of North America. High winds are common in
   this region and the resulting waves can cause significant loss of
   nesting platforms, yet the behaviour of waves in these systems has not
   been well-studied. We used observational and experimental techniques to
   examine how Hardstem Bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus Muhl.) impacts wave
   attenuation through its clonal growth characteristics. The predictable
   growth patterns influence nest placement and nesting success in colonial
   nesting grebes and other over-water nesting waterbirds. We constructed
   an artificial nesting colony to experimentally test how location with
   respect to wave-exposure affects nest structural integrity in grebes.
   Additional experiments with boat wakes confirmed the importance of
   emergent vegetation in attenuating waves caused by watercraft. Nests
   gain more protection from being placed on the lee side of a stand of
   vegetation than by having denser vegetation right at the nest.
   Over-water nests that are more protected from wave action by vegetation
   are at least three times more likely to hatch eggs than more exposed
   nests.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of the crayfish gastroliths and exoskeleton
   pieces for quantifying crayfish abundance and size-structure in diets of
   White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) chicks in the Everglades. We then
   quantified crayfish and fish abundance from farious small hard parts and
   intact fish heads in 23 boluses, taken from two nesting colonies in
   Water Conservation Area 3 (WCA 3) and Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee
   National Wildlife Refuge (Lox) in the Florida Everglades during May
   2006. We determined that using gastroliths to estimate crayfish numbers
   in boluses had significant drawbacks; only a small fraction of
   field-caught crayfish bear gastroliths and the two crayfish species in
   the Everglades differ in percentage bearing gastroliths. In contrast,
   counts of crayfisy rostrums we determined the size-structure of crayfish
   found in the diets of the New Colony 3 birds, and determined that the
   crayfish in the diet were relatively large (mean = 19 mm carapace
   length) when compared to the availabe crayfish in the marsh. These
   crayfish were also large relative to previous reports of crayfish found
   in White Ibis diets in the Everglades.}},

Abstract = {{Diet of Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) nestlings was
   studied during four consecutive breeding seasons (1999-2002) at three
   Greek colonies (Axios Delta, Lakes Kerkinin and Mikri Prespa) in order
   to assess variation and commercial value of prey. A variety of fish taxa
   were found in nestlings' regurgitates in each area and season, but only
   one or two dominated by numbers or biomass. Black Goby (Gobius jozo).
   Round Sardinella (Sardinella aurita) and Twaite Shad (Alosa fallax) were
   the most important prey in the Axios Delta: Bleak (Alburnus alburnus),
   Giebel (Carassius auratus gibelio) and Roach (Ruthilus rutilus) at Lake
   Kerkini; Chalcalburmus belvica and Giebel at Lake Mikri Prespa. Nestling
   diet varied both seasonally (but only at Lake Kerkini significantly so)
   and annually (significantly in the Axios Delta and at Lake Mikri
   Prespa). Temporal changes can be attributed to changes in prey
   availability and abundance and confirm this bird's opportunistic
   behaviour. Between-colonies, differences in diet were significant,
   probably due to differences in habitat and prey species diversity and
   composition. The low consumption of valuable fish prey by Great
   Cormorant nestlings (<10\%, numbers and biomass) suggests minimal
   competition with human interests.}},

   (Phalacrocorax carbo): Does it Reflect Season-Dependent Difference in
   Foraging Efficiency?}},

Abstract = {{Diet of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was studied using
   regurgitated pellets, individual fish bones and fish remains collected
   from below roosting trees at Zelivka and Slapy Reservoirs, Czech
   Republic, during summer, a warm winter and a cold winter. Both
   reservoirs have the same trophic status and similar fish assemblages.
   Using diagnostic bones (as pharyngeum, dentale, praeoperculare) and our
   own linear regression equations relating dimensions of the diagnostic
   bone and fish total length (L-r), a total of 2,055 fish of 18 species
   and four families were identified in the diet of Great Cormorants and
   their size was reconstructed. Both fish total length and weight differed
   significantly between seasons being, on average, 12.0 cm and 30 g during
   summer, 18.3 cm and 109 g during a warm winter. The average weight of
   fish taken by Great Cormorants significantly increased with decreasing
   air and water temperature. The contribution of the dominant ``large
   growing{''}, torpedo-shaped fish species in the diet of Great Cormorants
   dramatically increased from summer to the cold winter. In contrast, the
   contribution of dominant ``small growing{''}, torpedo-shaped species, or
   humped body-shaped species, showed completely the opposite tendency.
   Great Cormorants seem to consume all fish of appropriate size that they
   are able to catch in summer and select for larger fish in winter. Thus,
   the winter elevation of foraging efficiency described for Great
   Cormorants in the literature is due to capturing larger fish not to
   capturing more fish.}},

Abstract = {{Common Eider (Somateria mollissima dresseri) breeding success and
   gull-eider interactions were studied at Stratton Island, Maine in 2004
   and 2005. Eiders suffered little nest predation, and most egg losses to
   gulls were either facilitated by researcher intrusions or confined to
   newly inititated, unattended nest. Despite high nest success (>80\%) in
   both study years, predation watches indicated that few, if any,
   ducklings survived to fledging as a result of extreme harassment and
   predation by Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus). Gull attacks were
   opportunistic, involved one to 36 gulls, and often resulted in complete
   creche destruction. herring Gulls (L. argentatus) also took occasional
   young and eggs. Although Stratton Island is managed as a tern
   restoration site, and gull control measures to enhance tern productivity
   include nest destruction and shooting of tern predators, gulls continued
   to congregate around creching areas and to prey on ducklings. We suggest
   that additional gull control measures, particularly at a nearby gull
   colony, may enhance duckling survival. We also recommend monitoring of
   other eider colonies in the region to better assess duckling survival
   and recruitment rates.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands are critical foraging areas for many waterbird species, and
   their relatively high productivity often determined the coexistence of
   several species using food resources for breeding and/or refueling
   during migration. Between 18 October and 20 December 2000, we gathered
   information on foraging habitat use and feeding techniques of sixteen
   waterbirds during the austral spring at Malaspina inlet, Chubut,
   Argentina. We quantified the utilization by waterbirds of ten foraging
   habitat types and seven feeding techniques on seven fixed survey
   stations along the coastline, representing the different coastal
   habitats of the Malaspina inlet. The waterbird assemblage was structured
   in three main guilds: shallow water frequenters (three cormorants, two
   terns, a grebe, and two steamer-ducks), hard habitat peckers (two gulls,
   an egret, and an oystercatcher) and soft habitat frequenters (two
   oyster-catchers, a sandpiper, and a duck). These differed greatly in
   their use of habitats and feeding techniques, suggesting clear
   differences in the use of food resources. Most of the groups defined
   used almost exclusively one feeding technique or habitat type. This fact
   and the low resource utilization breath values suggest the existence of
   a relatively high degree of specialization within this waterbird
   assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Humans may modify winter habitat of the imperiled Piping Plover
   (Charadrius melodus), yet published accounts of the species winter
   ecology are rare. We studied Piping Plovers at Oregon Inlet, North
   Carolina from December 2005 to March 2006. Plovers used a 20.1 km(2)
   area (100\% minimum convex polygon home range) containing narrow barrier
   islands with ocean sound-side beaches, and small shoals,
   dredged-material islands, and marsh islands in shallow-water sounds.
   Plover activity was concentrated in twelve areas totaling 2.2 km(2)
   (95\% fixed kernel home range). When plovers were on ocean beaches, they
   spent less time foraging (18\%) than when on Sound Island beaches (88\%)
   and islands (83\%, P = 0.003). Sound island use increased and beach use
   decreased as the tide dropped (Logistic regression, P < 0.001). Plover
   use of dredged-material islands implied that habitat managers can create
   or restore attractive foraging sites where habitat may be declining or
   limiting. Wintering habitat management should aim to provide foraging
   opportunities during most of the day across a range of tide conditions
   and ensure that foraging habitat is close to roost sites.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed a heronry for 16 years of study nest site selection in
   relation to bird species presence and vegetation structure.
   Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) was the most abundant
   species, while Littel Egret (Egretta garzetta) and Grey Heron (Ardea
   cinerea) increased only in the last years. In a first phase,
   Black-crowned Night Herons selected tall Black Locusts (Robinia
   pseudoacacia) for nesting. Later they moved into the un-destroy,
   selecting Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus
   nigra), while the higher canopy was used by Grey Herons. The result was
   stratification of nests of different species. Considering the succession
   in use of different forest strat by the medium-sized heron species and
   years of Grey-Heron arrival, it is likely that the forest structure more
   than competition between species influenced nest site selection in this
   heronry.}},

Abstract = {{Although the collection of air-dried blood samples on filter paper has
   been used for field work as a routine, it has required the use of
   special and expensive types of paper. In the present manuscript the use
   of common filter paper to collect and store air-dried bird blood samples
   is validated for its use in DNA based sexing techniques with a very
   simple method avoiding DNA purification for PCR. This method not only
   simplifies the laboratory work but also does not add any additional cost
   for DNA-based sexing techniques. The method was tested and successfully
   employed for sex determination by molecular techniques on blood samples
   taken on common filter paper during different field trips from four
   seabird species.}},

Abstract = {{The Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) is one of the most endangered avian
   species in the world. In 1981, seven ibis were discovered in the Qinling
   Mountain, central China. The ibis population responded positively to 20
   years of intensive conservation growing to more than 500 birds.
   Population growth of the Crested Ibis exhibited a nonlinear response to
   increased population size (less than 20 birds). Limited availability of
   habitats at high elevations might result in competition for food and
   other resources among the ibis. The ibis returned to traditional nesting
   habitats at low elevations (< 1,000 m) and has grown exponentially since
   1992. Fledging success of the ibis did not differ between low- and
   high-elevation habitats. Rapid population growth of the ibis in
   low-elevation habitats was mainly due to increased breeding population
   size and reduced anthropogenic disturbances. Differences in population
   growth pattern along an altitudinal gradient indicate that
   high-elevation habitats are suboptimal. Likewise, the recovery of other
   endangered or threatened species may be constrained by suboptimal
   habitats. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting habitat
   requirements of endangered species based only on presently occupied
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat selection in Black-tailed Gulls (Larus crassirostris) on Hongdo
   Island, Korea, was studied during the breeding period in 2002-2003. To
   compare topographical advantages and disadvantages on breeding, we
   examined two biology and feeding frequency. In rocky-cliff habitat,
   Black-tailed Gulls had higher clutch size, faster laying and hatching
   date, and higher hatching and fledging success. Topographically,
   rocky-cliff habitat had two advantages-it was closer to sea and
   difficult to access. Proximity to the sea allowed higher feeding
   frequency whereas difficult access restricted predators. Conversely,
   grass habitat was farther from the sea and allowed easier access to
   predators, but a lot of grass covered nests to protect eggs and chicks.
   These disadvantages caused low feeding frequency and higher hatching
   failure. Egging by fisherman was also a disadvantages of grassy habitat
   because of easy access from landing places. Therefore, our results
   suggested that rocky-cliff habitat was more profitable habitat than
   grassy habitat and this profitability was related to topographical
   difference between habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Abdim's Storks Ciconia abdimii were studied in a post-breeding staging
   area dominated by Sahelian grasslands in southeastern Niger. In late
   September 2003, a total of 5,763 birds was recorded on systematic
   transect counts. The estimated density was 5.66 per km(2), equivalent to
   a total of c. 17,000 Abdim's Stork within the utilized area of 3,000
   km(2). A high percentage of juveniles in the flocks in late August, when
   the Nigerien breeding population is still at their nests, indicate a
   southern origin of the birds. The storks probably make northward
   post-breeding movements into the Sahel to feed on locally abundant food
   supplies, first of all Senegalese Grasshopper Oedaleus senegalensis, the
   dominant grasshopper species in the area. The mean density of Oedaleus
   in late September 2003 was 11.2 per m(2) (6.7 g fresh weight/m(2)).
   Storks feeding on grasshoppers made on average 5.6 successful pecks per
   min during their first h of daily feeding, enabling them to fulfil 95\%
   of their daily energy requirements within one h. In 2005, Oedaleus
   densities were only 5.1 per m(2) (2.8 g fresh weight/m(2)). Foraging
   storks made on average 2.5 and 1.9 successful pecks per min during the
   first and second h of daily feeding, respectively, and even two h of
   active foraging allowed them to fulfil only 70-75\% of their daily
   needs. As a probable consequence, the storks left the area earlier than
   in 2003. Flocks of Abdim's Stork are able to significantly reduce
   grasshopper densities in frequently used areas, but their impact on
   Oedaleus numbers within the 3,000 km(2) utilized area as a whole is
   probably negligible. However, the impact of the storks should not be
   viewed in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{We determined whether lipid extraction of seabird muscle, liver and
   feathers is required for delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis, based on a
   study of Barau's Petrels (Pterodroma baraui) and White-tailed
   Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus). Samples were analyzed for stable
   isotopes before and after lipid removal. Lipid-free muscle and liver
   were significantly enriched in C-13 compared to those containing lipids
   (0.52 parts per thousand and 0.61 parts per thousand mean differences in
   delta C-13 respectively) implying that lipids should be extracted from
   these tissues to avoid effects of uncontrolled differential lipid
   content. However lipid extraction also slightly increased muscle delta
   N-15 values in tropicbirds. Researchers should thus run samples
   separately for delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis, extracting lipids
   only in aliquots in which delta C-13 is measured, or apply arithmetic
   delta C-15 normalization methods on non lipid-extracted samples.
   Predictive models developed from our data, inferring delta C-13 values
   of lipid-extracted material from delta N-13 values and C:N ratios of non
   lipid-extracted material are presented and compared to five
   normalization methods taken from literature. Our models showed the best
   prediction efficiencies followed by that developed by McConnaughey and
   McRoy (1979). In feathers, no difference in stable isotopic measurements
   were noted between aliquots treated with sodium hydroxide or 2:1
   chloroform:methanol. Both protocols seem suitable for preparing feather
   samples for isotopic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the food exploitation patterns of three day herons, Great
   Egret (Ardea alba), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Tricolored Heron (E.
   tricolor) and a nocturnal species, the Black-crowned Night-Heron
   (Nycticorax nycticorax) that nested together in an estuarine colony.
   Types and sizes of prey were determined by analyzing the food of
   nestlings. These data were evaluated in light of relative abundance of
   prey, which was based on fish collected in nearby tidal creeks. The
   majority of food items (43\%) taken by the heron assembly consisted of a
   two species of nekton, Mummuchog (Fundulus heteroclitus) and Grass
   Shrimp (Palaemoneles pugio). Among the day herons, dietary compositions
   overlapped to the extent expected if each individual was foraging
   randomly. The diet of the Black-crowned Night-Heron diverged
   significantly from those of the Snowy Egret and Tricolored Heron, but
   not from that of the Great Egret. Considering relative abundance of
   different sized Mummichogs, the lengths of dietary Mummichogs overlapped
   as expected between each heron species. The three day herons coincided
   in their use of feeding microhabitats, most of which were in the
   intertidal zone. I found no evidence of social foraging: group sizes of
   feeding herons were the same as those of herons engaged in other
   activities, and most birds foraged alone. Foraging birds were rarely
   aggressive. Similarities (overlaps) in resource exploitation, as
   measured by type and size of prey and by microhabitat use, were as
   expected under a null model. Only two of 15 pairwise overlaps were less
   than expected; two were greater than expected. The four heron species
   formed an assembly of opportunists, whose members took prey according to
   abundance. The results provide little evidence that the herons
   partitioned food resources in any significant way. The lack of
   competitive or cooperative interactions between herons may be related to
   the superabundance of a few prey species, a condition probably typical
   of most estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed potential factors contributing to variation in counts of
   staging Bonaparte's Gulls (Larus philadelphia) on the Niagara River in
   southern Ontario. Much of the Mississippi Flyway population of this
   species stages each autumn at this site, en route to the Gulf coast and
   Mexico. Between 1986-96, weekly or bi-weekly counts were made of gulls
   flying to their nocturnal roost at the mouth of the Niagara River
   entering Lake Ontario, to assess the seasonal and temporal patterns of
   movement. Counts began each year in early October, corresponding to the
   `second wave' of gulls. Generally, this second wave of autumn movements
   began in early October to late November (median 1 November) and
   continued until late January or mid-February (median 5 February). Model
   selection based on a repeated measures analysis (Generalized Estimating
   Equations) demonstrated a quadratic relationship between counts and time
   of year and a linear relationship with daily count duration. Less
   evidence existed for the role of mean daily temperature in explaining
   variation (positive relationship) in counts; more data, or inclusion of
   different weather variables (e.g., wind, cloud cover), may demonstrate
   that it is more important than our models suggest. Maximum counts were
   from early November to late January (median 6 December). Peak daily
   totals per season varied between 6,300 (1993/94) and 40,000 (1990/91).
   Migration counts may be useful to help monitor populations of this
   species, provided that variables affecting seasonality in counts are
   accounted for and the turn-over rate of individual gulls staging in the
   area is determined (e.g., through mark-recapture or radio-telemetry
   studies).}},

Abstract = {{Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) is monomorphic in plumage such
   that sexes cannot be separated by plumage characteristics. In contrast,
   it displays sexual size dimorphism, with males generally being larger
   than females. Sexual dimorphism and variability in size of the
   continental Great Cormorant (P.c.sinensis) was studied in Greece to
   develop useful sexing techniques using morphometric measurements. Body
   mass, wing, culmen, and tarsus length of 81 birds controlled under
   license were measured during the wintering season in 1999-2002. The sex
   of each bird was determined by dissection and gonadal inspection.
   Forward stepwise discriminant analyses were performed to provide
   reliable functions that would enable the prediction of sex of a bird.
   Differences in size between adult and juvenile birds were not
   significant in both sexes, whereas males were larger than females in all
   measurements. Body mass (19.2\%) and culmen length (11.1\%) were the
   most dimorphic variables of those looked at followed by tarsus (6.5\%)
   and wing (6.1\%) length. Although wing length was the least dimorphic
   variable, it also displayed the lowest coefficient of variation (2.3\%)
   thus being the best single measurement for separating the sexes. Three
   discriminant functions that correctly classified 92.6-95.1\% of Great
   Cormorants of this sample were produced. These functions were reliable
   (similar accuracy for discriminant analysis and jackknife validation)
   and seasonally unbiased, as body mass was excluded from the analyses.
   The function including wing and culmen length as variables showed
   somewhat lower accuracy when tested with a new sample from The
   Netherlands suggesting that the obtained functions should be applied
   with caution to other populations, especially within the area of overlap
   between the sexes, unless inter-population sources of variation (e.g.,
   geographic variation, hybridization, inter-observer bias) are
   sufficiently understood.}},

   Overall, 157 individuals from the eastern Bay of Biscay (N Spain) were
   measured, and the sex determined in 155 individuals, by means of
   DNA-analyses. All feathers and skeletal-associated measurements, except
   the distance between each primary (P1 to P5) feather and the wing tip in
   a folded wing varied between the sexes, with males being larger than
   females. Sexual selection is discussed to be the major cause explaining
   these differences. A discriminant function is provided to separate
   sexes. By contrast, both wing tip patterns of coloration and bill

Abstract = {{Nurnbers of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) have declined
   dramatically in at least one important breeding area in the Western
   Canadian Arctic (WCA) and the regional population is small and widely
   scattered. The overall Pacific Flyway Population, to Which the WCA Brant
   belong, has declined historically as well, probably in part due to high
   rates of harvest and low rates of survival during the 1960s and 1970s.
   To better under stand how changes in survival rates may, have influenced
   WCA Brant, band recoveries and recaptures were used to estimate
   historical (1962-67 and 1975-79), and more recent (1991-2001) survival
   rates. On the mainland WCA, adult survival rates (derived Front band
   recoveries) averaged 0.719 +/- SE 0.045 and 0.693 +/- 0.082 in the 1960s
   and 1970s, respectively but increased significantly (P < 0.05) to 0.884
   +/- 0.052 (based on hand recoveries of both sexes) or 0.886 +/- 0.025
   (based on recaptured females) during 1991-2001. Comparable survival
   rates for juvenile Brant, derived from hand recoverics only, were 0.216
   +/- 0.051, 0.460 +/- 0.112, and 0.694 +/- 0.205, and increased
   significantly over time. On Banks Island, located 250 kin northeast of
   out, mainland study site, adult survival rates averaged 0.945 +/- 0.037
   during 1992-94. The harvest of Pacific Flyway Brant has declined
   substantially since the 1960s which possibly explains much of the
   observed increase in survival estimates in WCA Brant. The most recent
   survival estimates for WCA Brant are as high as, or higher than, those
   for other areas in arctic North America or Eurasia. Managing harvest to
   maintain current levels of survival, and maintaining or increasing
   current levels of productivity (known to have declined in at least one
   important breeding area) may be required to maintain WCA Brant at
   present population levels.}},

Abstract = {{Inferences on seabird ecology from stable isotopes ratios (delta C-13,
   delta N-15) and mercury concentrations analysis of feathers have been
   made for temperate and polar species but are far more rare for tropical
   species. In this paper, we used this approach combined with analysis of
   regurgitations and feeding observations at Colonies to g examine diet
   segregation between Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) and Lesser Noddies
   (Anous tenuirostris) breeding sympatrically on Aride Island
   (Seychelles), western Indian Ocean. Our results indicated extensive
   overlap between the two species ill trophic level and foraging area
   during the breeding season. Goatfish predominated (93-97\%) in all diet
   samples of adults and chicks collected in the colonies, except in prey
   fed to mates by Roseate Terns, of which scad and tuna comprised 20\%.
   The isotopic analyses of feathers replaced by adults (primary and body
   feathers) suggested, however, that the two species differ in foraging
   ecology during the nonbreeding period. Roseate Tern adults had
   consistently lower delta N-15 values than Lesser Noddies which, in turn,
   had delta N-15 values comparable to those of chick feathers grown on
   Aride. Moreover, low but similar mercury levels were found in body
   feathers of Lesser Noddy adults and Roseate Tern chicks, whereas Roseate
   Tern adults were significantly more contaminated. Overall, these results
   support the hypothesis that the Lesser Noddy is largely sedentary, being
   associated with the Same food web in the vicinity of the colonies
   year-round. In contrast, Roseate Terns rely on distinct prey during the
   molting (nonbreeding) season which may be also consistent with a change
   in food web (i.e., a migratory regime) although the assignment of
   potential wintering areas remain difficult without isotopic basemaps
   currently available for the Indian Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is a federally listed species
   with three distinct breeding populations, including Great Plains
   (threatened), Great Lakes (endangered), and Atlantic Coast (threatened),
   all of which winter along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United
   States. The spatial distribution and site fidelity of wintering Piping
   Plovers was investigated on Little St. Simons Island (LSSI), Geogria,
   from 2003-2006, with emphasis on the conservation significance of this
   site for the endangered Greak Lakes population. Of the individually
   recognizable color-banded plovers observed on LSSI during 2003-2004
   (N=39), 31\% (N=12) were observed the following year; 69\% (N=9) of
   plovers that wintered in 2003-2004 returned to winter in 2004-2005.
   Although good winter survival in 2003-2004 was estimated, survival
   estimates dramatically declined in 2004-2005. Even with low survival
   estimates for 2004-2005, 44\% of these wintering individuals returned to
   winter in 2005-2006. Wintering plovers on LSSI were site faithful to
   particular sections of beaches and occupied small home-ranges. These
   data on site fidelity and home-range suggest that relatively small areas
   on LSSI may be disproportionate importance to wintering Piping Plovers.
   Critical habitat designations should take account of this within-island
   variation, and modest detection rates suggest plover numbers could be
   underestimated by single-visit surveys throughout their winter range.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 7,610 to 3,175 pairs of Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias)
   nested along 420 river km of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) from 1993
   to 2003. Numbers declined precipitously in the mid-1990s stabilizing
   somewhat in the early 2000s. The average number of nests in colonies was
   349 (SD=283). Annual colony turn over rate for the eleven year period
   was 0.15 and ranged from 0.06 to 0.29 each year. The number of years
   that a colony was active was positively correlated with the average
   number of nests present while the colonywas active. Of the eight
   colonies active in 1993 that averaged more than 349 nests, four were
   abandoned by 2003. Only one colony grew to greater than 349 nests during
   the study period. Custer et al. (2004) suggested that herons oil the UMR
   may be limited by forage resources or foraging habitat and social
   factors, as evidenced by the even spacing of colonies that reflects the
   maximum feeding range of herons on the river. To rule out nesting and
   foraging habitat limitation, landscape habitat features of terrestrial
   and aquatic areas were examined for colony areas and areas without
   colonies. Available fish monitoring data were used to examine potential
   interactions between herons and forage resources. Colony areas did not
   differ from areas without colonies in any habitat feature. Indices of
   potential heron forage fish increased from 1993 to 2002, although low
   indices of fish abundance in 1993 were likely influenced by flood
   conditions that year. Although fish availability to herons is related to
   flows and water levels, available data suggested that herons did not
   negatively impact their potential forage base. Numbers of herons were
   not correlated with indices of fish abundance from the preceding year
   oil a pool-wide scale. Indices of fish abundance were higher within 5
   kin of colonies than farther than 5 kin from colonies, and indices of
   fish abundance increased from June through August both near and far
   front colonies. Numbers of herons and locations and sizes of colonies
   varied annually, whereas landscape features typically van, little if at
   all from year to year. Indices of fish abundance also varied greatly by
   sample location and year. Disturbance, particularly by humans in this
   highly used river, should be examined in relation to limiting foraging
   opportunities and influencing behavior (colony and individual) and
   productivity in colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Three statewide surveys in South Carolina for American Oystercatchers,
   Haematopus palliatus, were conducted during the breeding season from
   2001-2003. A mean of 1,105 oystercatchers were recorded each year. In
   2002, 407 breeding pairs were documented and in 2003, 397 pairs. There
   were 378 nonbreeding oystercatchers in 2002 and 183 in 2003. The Cape
   Romain Region supported a majority of South Carolina's breeding pairs
   and nonbreeding flocks. Oystercatchers nested, on average, closer to
   each other on estuarine islands, (specifically made of shell) and
   farthest apart on edge shell mounds. Although historically
   oystercatchers may have nested primarily on front beaches, this study
   documented only 28\% of the breeding pairs on barrier island beaches,
   27\% on estuarine islands and 45\% on edge shell mounds. Twenty-four
   percent of all pairs in South Carolina were on edge shell mounds
   adjacent to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AIWW). Nesting on shell
   mounds may become increasingly important as beaches become more
   disturbed by humans and dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) have been documented as nesting along
   the central Platte River of Nebraska since 1949. The very first accounts
   of birds were on an island ``which was formed in the dredging of
   sand{''} (Wycoff 1950). Since that time more than 90\% of the documented
   nests occur on human created habitats consisting of commercial gravel
   mines and constructed river islands. From 1991 to 2005, Least Tern nests
   were monitored at sandpits that were managed specifically for nesting
   Least Terns and islands constructed in the Platte River and managed
   specifically to provide nest sites for Least Terns. In addition a set of
   sandpits which did not receive any management were monitored front 1994
   to 1997 to compare reproductive output to the managed sandpits. During
   the study period 647 Least Tern nests were documented at all sites. Of
   the nests observed 125 were on unmanaged sandpits, 473 were on managed
   sandpits and 49 were on islands. Hatching success for those nests was
   38\% on unmanaged sandpits, 65\% on managed sandpits and 71\% on
   constructed riverine islands. A total of 639 Least Tern chicks were
   observed to have fledged from these nests. Production of fledged chicks
   per nest for each type of nesting site were unmanaged sandpits 0.56
   fledglings/nest, managed sandpits 1.13 chicks/nest and islands 1.04
   chicks/nest. Nest success and fledgling survival was significantly
   greater at managed sandpits than unmanaged sandpits in the 1994 to 1997
   time period.}},

Pages = {{298-303}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most species of wading birds are monomorphic and present few or no
   external characteristics to allow for sex determination in the field. We
   used standard morphometric measurements and discriminant function
   analysis to determine the sex of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and White
   Ibises (Eudocimus albus). The models were validated based on sex
   determination from DNA. Two functions were created for Great Egrets;
   mass reliably discriminated 88\% of our samples, while wing chord
   separated 81\% of our samples. We included mass in the discriminant
   function analysis for Great Egrets because mass did not vary between
   years or within our pre-breeding sampling period. Mass was not included
   in our analysis of White Ibis because it differed by year and within our
   pre-breeding sampling period. White Ibis samples were separated by a
   discriminant function using the length of curved bill and tarsus. This
   function correctly classified 78\% of our samples. We provide simplified
   linear equations to calculate the sex of Great Egrets and White Ibises
   as well as Cut Off points where the probability of correctly sexing
   individuals drops below 75\%. Our model can be used to reduce the costs
   of sex determination by allowing researchers to use expensive DNA
   analysis techniques only for those individuals that cannot be reliably
   classified using the simple statistical model.}},

Abstract = {{A population survey for Long-billed Curlews (Numenius americanus) was
   completed in the western United States and Canada in 2004 and 2005. This
   survey was conducted during the early breeding season, using a
   stratified random sample from habitat strata. The survey design was a
   32-km road transect with 40 five-min point Counts at 800-m intervals.
   Detection probabilities were estimated using the removal method in which
   observations in one-min intervals were removed from further
   consideration. Model selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion
   resulted in a model where detection probability varied among observers,
   but was constant throughout the point count for each observer. Estimated
   detection probabilities for the point count duration were greater than
   0.68 for all observers. Counts were adjusted for detection probability
   and then used to estimate the mean density within surveyed point count
   plots. Overall, the range-wide estimate of total population size was
   161,181 individuals. The estimates were 183,231 individuals for 2004 and
   139,131 for 2005, with corresponding 90\% confidence intervats of
   113,324 to 422,046 and 97,611 to 198,252, respectively. In addition to
   estimates for both the United States and Canada, population densities
   were estimated for geographic sub-regions: Bird Conservation Regions,
   Shore-bird Planning Regions, administrative regions, and for each
   Canadian province. Issues and assumptions inherent in the study design
   and their implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated annual survival probabilities of color-banded adult Herring
   Gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding in a colony oil the Canadian shore of
   Lake Ontario, between 1981 and 1984, and between 1993 and 1998. During
   the study, major changes occurred in prey fish availability, fish-eating
   bird abundance, and organochlorine contaminant exposure. We used
   capture-mark-recapture models and an information-theoretic approach to
   model selection to explore the importance of indices for these
   environmental variables and the role of year and sex as exploratory
   effects. In our models, year but not sex acquired strong support
   suggesting important annual variation in our apparent survival (survival
   confounded by permanent emigration) and encounter probabilities. The
   arithmetic mean of our model-averaged apparent survival probabilities
   provided all estimate of 0.91 (0.02 SE), and four out of the seven
   estimates were high for the species (>= 0.93). Our model-averaged
   estimates suggested that apparent survival declined after 1995 to a low
   of 0.79 +/- 0.07 (SE). Of the three environmental covariates fitted to
   survival, only the abundance of Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) acquired
   strong support as an explanatory variable. Annual fluctuations in
   survival and the decline after 1995 may be a reflection of nutritional
   stress resulting from the decreased availability of lipid (energy) and
   high quality protein from this prey species, following the arrival of
   the exotic Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). These nutritional
   impacts may be exacerbated by some of the PCB-associated sublethal
   health effects documented in these gulls over the period of this study.
   Our limited success at isolating other important environmental
   covariates reinforces the difficulty posed in identifying the critical
   components of the complex of environmental variables encapsulated in
   `time'.}},

Pages = {{24-29}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The nest survival of the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) in coastal
   Mississippi was modeled to better understand their breeding biology and
   suggest management strategies for protecting nesting colonies. During
   the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons a total of 301 nests was monitored
   and hatching success was 67\% in 2004 and 39\% in 2005. Mean clutch size
   differed between years, although mean incubation length did not differ
   between years or between colonies on the mainland and barrier islands (P
   = 0.70). Nest survival was influenced by year, seasonal variation within
   year, clutch size, and colony. Nest survival was greatest in 2004, and
   within years nest survival followed a seasonal pattern where it was high
   from May through late June and then decreased through early August.
   Large clutches had greater survival than small clutches. There was
   considerable inter-colony variation in nest survival, and it appeared
   that low survival was correlated with disturbance risk at many colonies.
   This study provides the first detailed information on the nest survival
   of the Black Skimmer in Mississippi, increases the understanding of
   seasonal variation and other influences on nesting success, and provides
   a basis for suggesting conservation measures for this species during the
   nesting season.}},

Abstract = {{Resightings of Razorbills (Alca torda) handed as chicks on the Gannet
   Islands, Labrador (N = 1,873 resightings of 638 individuals) and Machias
   Seal Island, New Brunswick (N = 870 resightings of 291 individuals) were
   used to estimate the timing and age at first return to the natal colony
   and age at first breeding. In total, 14 one-year-old and 110
   two-year-old birds were observed on land. All one- and two-year-old
   birds were seen for the first time on the islands late in the breeding
   season after laying had occurred, with two-year-olds returning to the
   colony on average three weeks earlier than one-year-old birds. Age at
   first breeding was significantly lower on Machias Seal Island than the
   Gannet Islands, 3.88 +/- 0.13 SE and 4.40 +/- 0.13 SE years,
   respectively (range two to six years, N = 123). Four two-year-old birds
   were observed engaging in courtship and breeding behaviors, including
   copulation. Overall, age at first return and breeding was lower than for
   known European Razorbill colonies and is likely due to low breeding
   densities and fidelity at the two North American colonies studied.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1989 and 2003 colonies of Little Terns (Sterna albifrons)
   occurring in the lagoon of Venice (55,000 ha; Italy) have been surveyed.
   Each year the number of breeding pairs ranged between 31 (in 1997) and
   611 (in 1995), with a yearly mean of 205 (SD = +/- 163). An overall
   stability in breeding numbers was observed, with an increase from 1986
   to 1995 and a decrease afterwards. 34 sites were used; 13 (38\%) were
   saltmarsh islets, twelve (35\%) dredge islands, four (12\%) beaches and
   the remaining five (15\%) artificial beaches. Colony size median ranged
   between 25 and 15 pairs, with no differences among site typology. Sites
   used each year ranged between one and twelve, with a mean of 4.7 +/- 3.0
   sites. Turn over rate was high, 60\%, and it did not vary significantly
   among colony-sites type. Larger colonies were not more stable than
   smaller ones. Despite historically breeding at both beaches and
   saltmarshes, over the 15 years of study a shift in colony sites from
   beaches to saltmarshes and from these to dredge islands has been
   documented. Dredge islands, taken as a whole, were over the last years
   the most important breeding site in the entire lagoon.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted multiple Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) aerial
   surveys between I May and 31 July 2004 and 2005 on the Peribonka River,
   where a new hydroelectric reservoir will be created in 2007. We also
   conducted single pair and brood surveys on randomly chosen 5 x 5-km
   plots on the River drainage basin. Objectives were to assess the
   validity of the impact assessment surveys of 2002, examine the variation
   in pair and brood numbers, and determine recruitment and habitat
   characteristics related to productivity. During both years, the number
   of indicated breeding pairs (IBPs) declined steadily through May,
   whereas the social index (paired males/lone males) remained stable,
   declining only when few IBPs were located. However, backdated number of
   paired and lone males from observed broods suggested that the number of
   pairs remained maximal and constant during a three-week period centered
   on the fourth week of May in 2004 and the second week of May in 2005.
   IBP density (IBPs/10 km of shoreline) was 1.40 on the River and 0.64 in
   its drainage basin on average in 2005 (no surveys in 2004). When
   compared to results of the Black Duck Joint Venture (BDJV) surveys, IBP
   density was higher on the River by 0.69 IBPs in 2002, whereas densities
   in the two areas differed only by 0.07-0.29 in 2004 and 2005. No
   difference in brood density was perceived among survey sections and
   years. Recruitment rate was 0.15 in 2002, but increased to 0.57-0.67 in
   2005 and 2004. Variables related to wetland area and distance to
   wetlands explained most variability in IBP and brood locations. We
   believe that timing of surveys and weather were the primary factors that
   affected difference in productivity estimates between 2002 and the
   2004-2005 period.}},

Abstract = {{We used logistic regression to model the effects of weather, habitat,
   and management variables on Greater Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis
   tabida) nest success at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeast
   Oregon. We monitored 506 nests over 9 breeding seasons. Mean apparent
   nest success was 72\% +/- 4\% and varied from 51 to 87\%. Nest success
   was lower one year after a field was burned and declined with nest
   initiation date. Nest success was higher during warmer springs, in
   deeper water, and in years with moderate precipitation. Haying,
   livestock grazing, and predator control did not influence nest success.
   We suggest the short-term consequence of burning on nest success is
   outweighed by its long term importance and that water level management
   is the most important tool for managing crane nest success. Finally,
   studies of brood ecology, are needed to develop a more complete picture
   of crane nesting ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use patterns are influenced not only by characteristics of the
   habitat itself, but also by the nature of the surrounding landscape.
   Conservation of waterbirds in agricultural areas, therefore, needs to
   consider the effects of landscape patterns on the occurrence of species
   in individual fields. The relationships between the densities of
   waterbirds using flooded rice fields in winter and characteristics of
   the surrounding landscape were analyzed in California's Sacramento
   Valley. The spatial scale at which the landscape was described was
   varied by calculating the amount of each habitat type within 2 km, 5 km,
   and 10 km of each field's boundary. Waterbird densities in flooded
   fields were related to landscape patterns in various ways, but the
   nature of the relationships differed among taxonomic groups and depended
   on the scale at which the landscape was characterized. Densities of
   geese, wading birds, and shorebirds were positively correlated with the
   amount of wildlife refuge or semi-natural wetland in the vicinity of a
   flooded field. These two variables were highly correlated with each
   other and their effects could not be assessed independently. The
   abundance of flooded rice fields in the landscape was less likely to be
   related to bird use of flooded fields, but was positively related to
   duck densities at a 5 km scale and negatively related to shorebird
   densities at a 10 km scale. These results suggest a number of hypotheses
   about the ways in which landscape scale patterns of farmland management
   might affect waterbird use of individual fields, with potential
   repercussions for both birds and farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Increased human use of coastal areas threatens the United States
   population of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus Palliatus), a species
   of special concern. Biologists often attribute its low numbers and
   reproductive success to human disturbance, but the mechanism by which
   human presence reduces reproductive success is not well understood.
   During the 2003 and 2004 breeding seasons, 32 nesting attempts of
   American Oystercatchers were studied on Cumberland Island National
   Seashore (CINS). Behavior was examined with and without human activity
   in the area to determine how human activity affected behavior. The
   oystercatchers' behavioral responses (proportion time) were analyzed
   with and without human or intraspecific disturbances using mixed models
   regression analysis. Proportions of time human activities were present
   (<= 300 m from oystercatchers) during observations averaged 0.14 (N =
   32, 95\% CI = 0.08-0.20). During incubation, pedestrian activity near
   (<= 137 m) oystercatchers reduced the frequency of occurrence of
   reproductive behavior, but pedestrian activity far (138-300 m) from
   oystercatchers had no effect. Vehicular and boat activities (<= 300 m)
   had minimal effects on behavior during incubation. During brood rearing,
   an effect of pedestrian activity near oystercatchers was not evident;
   however, pedestrian activity far from oystercatchers increased the
   frequency of reproductive behavior. Vehicular and boat activity had no
   effects on behavior during brood rearing. Of 32 nesting attempts, two
   failed (<10\%) because of human disturbance and were located in areas of
   greater human activity (south end). Managers on CINS should minimize
   pedestrian activity near nests (<= 137 m) during incubation. During
   brood rearing, protection from pedestrian activity should be increased,
   when possible, to >137 m and vehicular activity should be minimized at
   current levels or less.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding success of African Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus moquini)
   was monitored over three austral summers on Robben Island, South Africa
   from 2001 to 2004. Robben Island is a bus), tourist destination which
   has a resident population that live and work on the island in addition
   to tourists that visit the island daily. Potential predators of birds'
   eggs and chicks include feral cats (Felis catus), Kelp Gulls (Larus
   dominicanus), Mole Snakes (Pseudaspis cana) and House Rats (Rattus
   rattus). The mean number of fledglings per pair declined from 0.74 in
   the first breeding season to 0.41 and 0.35 in the subsequent breeding
   seasons. This fledgling success slightly exceeded the threshold
   estimated to maintain a stable population, and is similar to fledging
   success observed in other oystercatcher species. The lower fledging
   success in the second and third breeding seasons compared to the first
   breeding season were increased depredation of eggs and chicks and
   high-tide events on 17 February 2003 and 10 February 2004. Predation can
   be aggravated by human disturbance, and it was found that the area with
   greatest resident and tourist activity had the greatest egg and chick
   losses in all three breeding seasons. The area adjacent to the disturbed
   area had reduced breeding success in the second breeding season,
   possibly a result of increased predation associated with the settlement.
   Breeding success near the Kelp Gull breeding colony decreased in the
   third breeding season; the period during which the greatest number of
   Kelp Gulls were breeding. The potential success of a breeding attempt
   decreased if incubation of the clutch started later in the breeding
   season.}},

Abstract = {{The spring condition hypothesis (SCH) states that the current decline of
   the North American scaup population (Lesser {[}Aythya affinis] and
   Greater Scaup {[}A. marila] combined) is due to a decline in quality or
   availability of scaup foods on wintering, spring migration, or breeding
   areas that has caused a reduction in female body condition and
   subsequent reproductive success. Our previous research indicated that
   forage quality in diets of Lesser Scaup (hereafter scaup) at two sites
   in Northwestern Minnesota was lower in springs 2000-2001 than that
   reported for springs 1986-1988, consistent with the SCH. Accordingly, we
   further tested the SCH at a landscape scale, by comparing amounts of
   amphipods in diets (index of forage quality) of scaup (N = 263)
   collected in springs 20032005 from seven eco-physiographic regions in
   Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota in relation to data from Northwestern
   Minnesota during springs 2000-2001. We found that aggregate percentages
   of Gammarus lacustris and Hyalella azteca (amphipods) in scaup diets
   during springs 2000-2001 in Northwest Minnesota were similar to those
   ill the Iowa Prairie Pothole, Minnesota Morainal, Minnesota Glaciated
   Plains, Red River Valley, and Northwestern Minnesota in springs
   2003-2005; however, scaup consumed relatively higher aggregate
   percentages of Ganimarus lacustris and Hyalella azteca in North Dakota
   Missouri Coteau and North Dakota Glaciated Plains. Females in Iowa were
   over three times less likely to have consumed food than those in North
   Dakota, despite previous research indicating similar foraging rates
   among these regions. Mean mass of scaup diet samples throughout the
   upper-Midwest were 77 mg (49\%) and 87 rug (52\%) lower than those of
   historical studies in Minnesota and Manitoba, respectively. We conclude
   that there has been a decrease in forage quality for scaup in Iowa and
   Minnesota and a decrease in the amount of forage consumed throughout the
   upper-Midwest, consistent with the SCH.}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) chick growth, diet, feeding rate
   and early survival and adult body condition were quantified on Hornoya,
   North Norway in 2002 and 2003 after a long-term change in diet from

   earl), 1980s to smaller, poorer quality gadids, Sand Lance and Herring
   (Clupea harengus). The results were compared with data collected in
   1980-1982, when feeding conditions were considered very favourable.
   Chick growth was similar in both periods. The breeding adults
   compensated for reduced food quality by increasing the feeding
   frequency, such that the chicks received the same amount of fish (g
   d(-1) and kj d(-1)) or even more in 2002-2003. This increase in activity
   did not, however, result in a decline in adult body mass, suggesting
   that prey were abundant close to the colony and that the parents did not
   Suffer from the apparent increased feeding effort.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the relationship between physical attributes of sandy
   beaches, levels of human disturbance, and shorebird occurrence was
   investigated. The linear density km(-1) of shorebirds on 42 km ofsandy
   beaches in Monterey Bay, California was documented from late autumn
   through spring, and the relationship of shorebird densities to two
   physical variables (slope of beach swash zone, total beach width), one
   spatial variable (distance to Elkhorn Slough, a wetland of regional
   importance for shorebirds), and relative level of human disturbance was
   analyzed using stepwise multiple regression. The six most abundant
   species were Sanderling (Catidtis alba), Willet (Tringa semipalmata),
   Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis
   squatarola), Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and Snowy Plover (Charadrius
   alexandrinus). Mean abundance of four of the six most abundant species
   (Marbled Godwit, Willet, Whimbrel, Black-bellied Plover) was negatively
   related to swash zone slope; flatter beaches supported more shorebirds.
   Mean abundance of all species analyzed was negatively related to
   distance to Elkhorn Slough; beaches closer to the mouth of Elkhorn
   Slough supported more shorebirds. Total beach width had no effect on
   shorebird occurrence, and level of human use appeared to have no effect.
   Most shorebird species were more abundant on beaches at low than at high
   tide, indicating that sandy beaches provide important foraging habitat
   regionally.}},

Abstract = {{Although shorebirds are detrimentally affected by marine oil spills,
   they are often overlooked during rescue and rehabilitation efforts. This
   note describes a rescue and successful rehabilitation effort of an oiled
   adult and a juvenile Hooded Plover (Thinornis rubricollis) in Victoria,
   south-eastern Australia, during an oil-spill which oiled almost 1 \% of
   the State's population of this threatened beach-nesting species. Two
   birds requiring intervention were located, selectively captured, cleaned
   and released. Both have survived at least two years after the spill and
   have bred, with at least one successfully fledging young. The fledgling
   has also successfully bred. Two nests with eggs present during clean-up
   operations were protected and hatched successfully. This small case
   study indicates that at least some groups of breeding shorebirds, such
   as plovers and dotterels, can be effectively rescued and rehabilitated
   during oil spills, and hence Should not be overlooked during such
   circumstances.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In herbivorous birds the processing rate of food is constrained by
   gizzard capacity. To enhance digestive processes, many species ingest
   grit to grind the food. Grit ingestion, however, may further limit the
   capacity of the gizzard. Graylag Geese (Anser anser) wintering in SW
   Spain fed mainly on Alkali Bulrush (Scirpus maritimus) tubers, showing a
   preference for small tubers. This preference may be due to a faster
   disintegration of small tubers than larger ones inside the gizzard. As
   larger tubers are likely coarser than smaller tubers, more grit would be
   necessary to process larger tubers. However, the ingestion of more grit
   to grind large tubers would be at the expense of ingesting additional
   tubers because of gizzard capacity limitations. Under these
   circumstances, there may be an inverse relationship between tuber size
   and amount of grit ingested to optimize food ingestion. Indeed, we found
   such a relationship. Grit facilitated the disintegration of tubers. This
   suggests that relying on some amount of grit to facilitate the grinding
   of food should outweigh the loss of gizzard capacity to the amount of
   food ingested.}},

   dabbling ducks occurred more often between indigenous species than
   expected, while geese hybrids occurred more often with non-native

Abstract = {{Since the first documented successful nesting of Wood Storks (Mycteria
   americana) in South Carolina in 1981, a total of 16,642 nesting attempts
   have been recorded. During file past 26 years, annual nesting has
   increased from eleven to a high of 2,057 nests in 2004. Storks have used
   27 different colony sites, however, five sites have supported 76.3\% of
   all nesting attempts. Mean colony size was 118 nests (range 1-547).
   Colony turnover rate was 0.19 overall based on annual calculations.
   However, 95.6\% of colonies with more than 100 nests in one year were
   active the following year (N = 68). Only three of 27 sites are in public
   ownership and 21 sites are in wetlands altered or maintained by man.
   Production of young has been high each year (x bar = 2.08 young per
   successful nest) and abandonment of active colonies has been rare. This
   may result from the availability of varied habitats used by foraging
   storks. Nesting storks use palustrine habitats associated with rivers,
   inter-tidal wetlands, isolated wetlands and marsh impoundments. The
   variety of habitats used, combined with the topography of our coastal
   plain, provide adequate foraging habitat under a wide range of rainfall
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Information on breeding and wintering Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus) in Greenland is very limited, and no firm estimates of
   breeding and wintering numbers are available. However, it is assumed
   that only a few thousand pairs breed in Greenland. Numbers of molting
   males are estimated at 5,000 to 10,000 birds. They comprise both
   Greenland and eastern Canadian breeders: their proportions are unknown,
   but the latter may verb, well constitute a significant part. If true,
   Greenland has a significant responsibility for the well being of the
   eastern Canadian breeding Population. Presently there are no immediate
   threats to the Harlequin Duck population in Greenland. Hunting (illegal)
   has only negligible effects and habitat destruction is extremely
   limited. However, oil spills from transport of oil and increased
   offshore oil exploration constitute a potentially serious threat to
   molting and wintering birds from the breeding populations in Greenland
   and in eastern Canada.}},

Abstract = {{In Iceland, the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) is generally
   distributed as a breeder oil rapA clear-water streams, from sea level to
   about 700 in. Densities are generally low, except at the headwaters of
   streams draining productive lakes where blackflies (Simulium vittalum)
   are abundant. In northwest, north and cast Iceland, molting Harlequin
   Ducks are found in similar localities as the wintering birds, but
   molting birds are largely absent front the southwest coast. During the
   molt, the birds often stay close to cliffs or rocks and are hard to
   find. Harlequin Ducks winter oil exposed rocky coasts and densities are
   correlated with substrate as indicated by shore exposure. In 1998-2001,
   the total wintering population of Harlequin Ducks in Iceland was
   estimated at 14,000, with 95\% confidence limits of 12,000 to 16,000.
   Assuming that migration in and out. Of Iceland is insignificant, the
   total Icelandic breeding Population is 3,000-5,000 females, or three to
   five females (pairs) 100 km(-2). A decline in wintering numbers was
   found in southwest Iceland in 1961-2002, but. numbers in the northeast
   have increased. This may be related to increased temperatures, but
   changes in exploitation may also have affected the population. The
   conservation of the Icelandic population of the Harlequin Duck is
   largely a matter of wise use of the coast and streams Which Should
   include preemptive measures, such as minimizing pollution and
   development. Small-scale river-development for power production and
   salmon fishing pose potential threats to Harlequin Ducks, but direct
   exploitation Of this population is not likely.}},

Abstract = {{Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) were first recorded nesting in Georgia
   in 1965 at Blackbeard Island National Wildlife Refuge (Harris 1995). In
   1992, biologists initiated annual aerial surveys of known wading bird
   rookery sites to document Wood Stork distribution and estimate the
   number of nesting pairs in Georgia. Additionally, personnel from the U.S
   Fish and Wildlife Service and Savannah River Ecology Laboratory have
   contributed annual ground-count data for several colonies. Since surveys
   began, stork nesting has been documented at least once in 43 locations
   across the Coastal Plain of the state, with an average of 14 active
   sites per year. The documented nesting effort for storks has increased
   from four pairs in one wading bird colony in 1965 to a high count of
   1,817 pairs in 19 colonies in 2005. A regression of log-transformed nest
   totals for the 14-year time-series (1992-2005) showed no significant
   overall trend in nesting pair numbers (P = 0.84) for that period.
   However, it is possible that an ongoing rebound from a drought-related
   crash could continue, resulting in an increasing trend. Thirty-three
   (77\%) of stork nesting locations were on private land, with only ten
   (23\%) nesting locations in public ownership. Seven colony sites have
   supported an average of 68\% of the stork nesting effort since 1992; in
   2005 these sites supported 77\% of the nesting effort. Although not a
   systematic census of all potential stork nesting habitat, these
   standardized surveys have produced a useful estimate of Wood Stork
   population size, distribution, and stability in Georgia. We believe that
   Georgia's Wood Stork population has shown an increase in size and
   distribution, and that numbers can continue to increase or stabilize as
   long as hydrologic conditions favorable to the species persist.}},

Abstract = {{Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) breed in colonies widely dispersed
   across approximately 3,350 km(2) within the United States, and effective
   monitoring of this population presents immediate tradeoffs between
   coverage, accuracy, and cost. Here, we summarize surveys in Florida
   1991-2005 as a first step towards improving existing survey strategies.
   In order to determine whether counts from aircraft are a suitable
   technique for quantifying nests, we compared aerial and ground counts at
   the same eleven colonies in 2004. Across all colonies, aerial counts
   averaged 8.1\% more nests, probably as result of either better
   visibility or mistakenly including Great Egret (Ardea alba) nests in the
   count. During the period 1991-2005, statewide totals in Florida ranged
   from 2,211-6,449 nests, with an apparently increasing trend through
   time. Annual modal colony size fluctuated from 65-144 nests, with
   significantly smaller modal size in 2001-2004, suggesting that colony
   size has decreased over time. Current survey practices are to visit all
   previously active colonies and all new ones that are reported or that
   are encountered during flights between known colonies. Surveys are not
   systematic, and the number or importance of novel, undetected colonies
   is unknown. In south Florida, where past and potential colony sites have
   been systematically surveyed annually, turnover (proportion of colony
   sites different in two surveys) increased rapidly with interval between
   surveys, and within ten y, >80\% of colony sites differed. Annual
   turnover rates were not uniform across years, and young colonies
   appeared to have higher turnover than older ones (up to four y). Novel
   systematic aerial transects across suitable habitat in central Florida
   revealed approximately one novel colony/525 km(2). Thus, abandonment of
   old colonies and formation of new ones is a typical and fairly rapid
   process in this species. Throughout the state, larger colonies were more
   persistent, and were surveyed more often than small colonies. The bias
   of the current nonsystematic survey strategy is towards visiting older
   colonies that are likely to disappear within 15 y, and against finding
   newer, growing colonies. This is likely to bias estimates of total
   population downwards compared to true values. We strongly recommend that
   surveys be geographically systematic, even if this reduces coverage. We
   suggest these systematic surveys be located in large blocks (hundreds or
   even thousands of km(2)) in areas with suitable habitat and historically
   high colony densities.}},

   area of southeastern Baffin Island, where surveys in the 1930s also
   found the species. However, it occurs as far west as Cape Dorset, and as
   far north as Clyde River. Few birds were observed during recent field
   surveys, Suggesting that the population on Baffin Island is small and

   be best accomplished rising community-based surveys by hunters.}},

   success rates were monitored for nine stork colonies in Georgia and
   South Carolina in 2004 and 2005. Overall success rates were very high in
   2004 (N = 421, (x) over bar = 2.3 fledged young per nesting attempt),

   in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies. Reduced success in
   2005 may be due to elevated mid-breeding season rainfall and its
   negative effects on prey availability. Examination of longer-term
   breeding success at multiple Georgia stork colonies relative to annual
   rainfall showed no consistent trends between success and mid-season

Abstract = {{In the last decade, several survey and research efforts have been
   undertaken to better understand the ecology and distribution of
   Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) in Quebec. The results of
   these efforts are summarized and new survey, research and management
   needs arc identified. Harlequin Ducks breed oil rivers and streams of
   the Gaspe Peninsula, the Quebec North Shore, and the immense Hudson Bay
   and Ungava Bay drainage basins. Quebec is possibly the most important
   breeding area for Harlequin Ducks in eastern Canada, and there is every
   indication that a significant proportion of the birds wintering in
   south-western Greenland and in eastern North America breed in Quebec. In
   spring, significant numbers of birds spend a few days or weeks along the
   Gaspe Peninsula before departing for their breeding or molting areas.
   The most important molting sites in Quebec are Bonaventure Island, the
   Port-Daniel/New-port area, and the Pointe du Sud-Onset/Jupiter River
   area oil Anticosti Island. Known fall staging areas include the coastal
   waters of the Gaspe Peninsula, the Pointe du Sud-Ouest/Jupiter River
   area, and Brion Island, oil the Magdalen Islands. The few Harlequin
   Ducks that overwinter in Quebec are mostly in Baie des Chaleurs, oil the
   south shore of the Gaspe Peninsula. There are no good data on trends; of
   Harlequin Ducks' in Quebec. Major threats to population recovery/health
   include hydroelectric development,,, illegal mid subsistence harvests,
   coastal exploitation (aquaculture, fisheries, boating), and recreational
   activities on breeding rivers and streams. Survey, research and
   management needs include better estimates of breeding densities and
   distribution, characterization of spring, summer and fall coastal
   habitats, comprehensive generic analysis, monitoring, and Public
   education oil the status of Harlequin Ducks.}},

Abstract = {{The combined rate for 21 Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) colonies during
   2003-2005 was 1.19 +/- 0.09 fledglings/nest (N = 4,855 nests). The mean
   fledging rate of 0.61 fledgling/nest for colonies during 2005 was
   significantly less than the rate of 1.47 fledglings/nest in 2003 and
   1.43 fledglings/nest in 2004. A comparison of the annual fledging rates
   for a subset of 13 colonies monitored during all three years indicates
   the overall probability of fledging >1 nestling was significantly
   greater in both 2003 (69.7\%) and 2004 (69.8\%) than in 2005 (38.5\%).
   Though the probability of fledging one stork was similar among years
   (range 9.7-12.0\%), the probabilities of 0, 2, or >3 fledglings were
   significantly different in 2005 than in either 2003 and 2004. Colony
   size and longitude had no significant effect on mean colony
   productivity. However, latitude did have a significant positive effect
   on colony productivity. Thus, colonies farther north in Florida tended
   to exhibit greater productivity. The colonies in the northeastern and
   northwestern regions of the state generally had greater fledging rates
   than did colonies farther south in Florida, especially the southeast
   region. This study also identified objectives for management activities
   and future research. There is a need to develop an unbiased estimator of
   productivity that takes into consideration the lack of nesting during
   some years, which would allow managers to more accurately estimate stork
   productivity at the regional level. Because some colonies out perform
   others, an index-type system of colonies should be developed to
   designate colonies that perform above a modeled fledging rate, thus
   offering long-term insight into stork productivity. A re-examination of
   the productivity indices listed in the Wood Stork Recovery Plan is
   needed to ensure the current status of the U.S. breeding population.}},

Abstract = {{Labrador represents a significant portion of the breeding range for the
   Northwest Atlantic population of the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus
   histrionicus). The region comprises almost 300,000 kill of wilderness
   area with habitat for breeding, molting and staging activity. The
   wilderness quality of Labrador has also posed several challenges in
   terms Of understanding the status of this species. Expensive and
   logistically-challenging survey programs have only recently (i.e., last
   20 years) targeted Harlequin Ducks but due to the co-ordination amongst
   agencies and proponents, all appreciation of the range, numbers,and
   timing of movements for this species in Labrador has been developed.
   Over 800 helicopter survey hours have been completed on at least 111
   river systems/sections during late May-early June (July in northern-most
   areas) front 1987-2008. Presence of the species was widespread and
   confirmed oil approximately 67\% of areas examined. It is estimated that
   395 breeding pairs Occur Oil rivers where presence has been confirmed
   and the majority of potential habitat for this species has been examined
   ill Labrador. The actual number of breeding pairs, their success and
   other population limiting factors remain unclear. Regardless, Harlequin
   Ducks arc common in Labrador and the population appears to be stable or
   increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) breeding in the southeastern United
   States exhibit lengthy inter- and intra-regional movements in response
   to resource availability. One type of movement., post-breeding
   dispersal, has resulted in storks from this population temporarily
   moving into the Gulf Coast states of Alabama and eastern Mississippi.
   Concurrently, other Wood Storks, presumably of Mexican/Central American
   origin, are frequently observed in large numbers in the Mississippi
   River Valley and nearby western states during the late-summer months and
   the proximity of dispersing storks from the two regions might result in
   population mixing. In a preliminary examination of the origins of Wood
   Storks observed in Gulf Coast states and the likelihood of population
   mixing, we deployed ten satellite transmitters on storks in those areas
   in June-July of 2003 and monitored their movements. All storks captured
   in eastern Mississippi moved into southern Florida. Storks captured in
   western Mississippi went to eastern Mexico or western Guatemala. One
   stork from Louisiana went to Mexico and the other went to southern
   Florida, suggesting that population mixing may be occurring on their
   non-breeding season habitats.}},

Abstract = {{We modeled population dynamics and extinction probabilities for the
   endangered Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) using count data from
   synoptic aerial surveys, annual measures of productivity from throughout
   the southeastern U.S., and survival data from satellite-tagged
   juveniles. Using a simple, count-based diffusion approximation approach
   we were able to quantify an increasing population trend since 1976. High
   inter-year variability resulted in wide confidence intervals and we
   could not eliminate the possibility of long-term population decline in
   spite of recently measured population increases. We also used a
   stage-based population matrix model to incorporate observed differences
   in survival rates among age classes. Fledging success, and survival of
   fledglings, one, and two-year-old birds were estimated using data from
   the satellite telemetry study. Because the survival rates of
   three-year-olds and adults are presently unknown, we analyzed population
   dynamics over a range of these values. Long-term population growth was
   most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship. This deterministic
   matrix model indicated that adult survival rates >0.94 were necessary to
   maintain a growing population, an estimate considerably higher than that
   observed in the European White Stork (Ciconia ciconia). This study
   underscores the need for reliable estimates of juvenile and adult
   survival in Wood Storks, and for a conservation focus on the factors
   that affect adult survival. It also provides a tool for understanding
   and projecting potential trajectories of the Wood Stork population in
   the Southeastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively low numbers of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus)
   are present year-round in Newfoundland, with breeding, molting and
   wintering at specific areas. Breeding is largely restricted to the Great
   Northern Peninsula, but there is some evidence of breeding in remote
   areas of the eastern part of the island. A large molting concentration
   is present on the Grey Islands, cast of the Northern Peninsula.
   Harlequin Ducks winter on the south coast of Newfoundland, with the
   largest concentration at Cape St. Mary's. Counts from Cape St. Mary's
   indicated Harlequin Ducks decreased through the 1980s, but have been
   increasing rapidly since the early 1990s. Although anecdotal,
   information from earl), Sources suggests populations of Harlequin Ducks
   in Newfoundland are much reduced. Chronic oiling and misidentification
   of Harlequin Ducks by hunters remain as threats, while forestry and
   hydroelectric development may be potential sources of habitat reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) area relatively rare species
   in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. Recent confirmed breeding records
   are restricted to northern New Brunswick. Sightings of small numbers of
   birds during the molting and staging periods occur in all three
   provinces. It is estimated that New Brunswick supports as many as 200
   wintering Harlequin Ducks, and almost 600 winter off the coast of Nova
   Scotia, although due to the extent of coast and occasional sightings of
   Harlequin Ducks from previously unknown locations, it is likely that
   these are minimum estimates, particularly for Nova Scotia. Few trend
   data are available in the Maritimes, but available information suggests
   an increase in the last five years. Hunting, both intentional and
   unintentional, still occurs; hunter education and enforcement to stop
   the Lake of this species could be worthwhile. Coastal development,
   including vacation home building and aquaculture sites, are occurring in
   places where Harlequin Ducks winter. There is a general need to monitor
   the impacts of these developments on local Harlequin Duck populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 1984, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the U.S. breeding
   population of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) in their known range of
   Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama as ``endangered{''} under
   the Endangered Species Act, due to a population decline of 75 percent
   from the 1930s to the 1980s. In 1997, an updated Recovery Plan for the
   Wood Stork established two metrics to for determining the biological
   status: numbers of nesting pairs and regional productivity measured over
   time. Five-year averages of nesting pairs from annual aerial surveys
   show an increasing trend (1981-85, 1991-95, 2001-2005). Since listing in
   1984, the average number of active colonies has almost doubled, however
   colony size has decreased. Current productivity estimates are similar to
   those recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. Monitoring continues to indicate
   that nesting numbers and productivity rates are variable within and
   among years and within and among colonies. Variability is likely related
   to environmental factors affecting the quality of local and regional
   nesting and foraging habitats. Loss of natural foraging habitat
   continues to be a major threat, while the effects of the increasing
   number of constructed wetlands and their use as foraging areas is
   unknown. Habitat Management Guidelines are being updated and will
   address: managing colony sites, controlling predation and human
   disturbance, and core foraging habitat issues. One of the most important
   initiatives is the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP),
   which has identifies the restoration of healthy wading bird populations
   as an expected benefit. It is anticipated that CERP will be a large
   contributing factor toward the recovery of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) arrive along the eastern
   coast of the United States at traditional wintering grounds from late
   September to December through early January. Counts in January and
   February best represent wintering bird numbers. Spring migrants depart
   from April to May, although from more southerly wintering areas, birds
   appear to depart in March. Breeding has never been confirmed in the
   eastern United States. Molting females have been documented in Maine
   during the fall, but the extent of molting has not been assessed. It is
   estimated 1,575 to 1,800 Harlequin Ducks wintered in the eastern United
   States from Maine to North Carolina between the winters of 1997-98 and
   2001-02. Over 75\% of the birds wintering in the eastern United States
   were in Maine, primarily in the vicinity of Isle an Haut. Smaller
   concentrations representing about 18\% of the wintering birds in the
   eastern United States were at locations in Massachusetts and Rhode
   Island, primarily the Cape Anne region and Martha's Vincyard,
   Massachusetts and the Sachuest Point region, Rhode Island. South of
   Rhode Island, Barnegat, New Jersey is the only area that regularly
   reports counts of over 25 birds. In the Isle an Haut region of Maine,
   numbers along survey routes have not shown a linear change from
   1989-2002, but show a pattern of decline from 1989 to 1993 followed by
   increases since then. In eastern Maine, population increases are
   greatest and birds are expanding their winter range into new areas. All
   Other areas in the eastern United States South of Isle an Haut that
   regularly report over 50 birds show significant population increases
   since the 1980s, north-eastern US.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{67-70}},
Abstract = {{Mid-winter activity budgets and diving behaviors of Harlequin Ducks
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) at Isle an Haut, Maine were examined.
   Feeding was the most frequent activity and the number of hours during
   the day devoted to feeding increased from December to March as day
   length increased. Resting was not a frequent midwinter activity, but
   birds rested more in the morning than in the afternoon and the duration
   of testing bents increased in March, likely in relation to increasing
   day length. During foraging bouts, first-winter males had longer
   submergence times and longer pause times than adult males, although the
   resulting dive:pause ratio was similar. This may be related to feeding
   inefficiency of the young birds or lack of experience with local
   habitats or prey species. Mean dive durations and pause durations at
   Isle an Haut were greater than reported elsewhere for this species, and
   may be related to strong local currents associated with the wave washed
   ledges on Isle an Haut.}},

Title = {{Allocating Foraging Effort Across Multiple Time Scales: Behavioral
   Responses to Environmental Conditions by Harlequin Ducks Wintering at
   Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2008}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behavior of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and its
   response to changing environmental conditions during winter was
   investigated at Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland. Behavioral synchrony
   among individuals permitted continuous observations of flocks to be
   conducted, sometimes over entire (lays. Overall foraging effort of
   Harlequin Ducks was examined at two organizational levels: dive cycles
   (dive and Surface pause) and foraging cycles (foraging bout and rest
   bout). Overall foraging effort decreased at greater tide depths as
   Harlequin Ducks decreased the duration of foraging])out:. Dive:pause
   ratios did not change Within these shorter foraging bouts at high tides,
   however the duration of dives, pauses, and the total (live cycle all
   increased. Overall foraging effort decreased in response to increased
   wind/wave exposure due to a decrease in dive duration. Overall foraging
   effort did not change in response to decreasing ambient temperature;
   however the frequency of (live cycles decreased which Could decrease
   energy expenditure associated with post-dive thermoregulatory Costs.
   Overall foraging effort increased throughout the day, particularly ill
   the last foraging bout before the overnight fasting period.
   Interestingly, this strategy was accomplished by decreasing dive
   durations but increasing foraging bout duration. These opposite results
   across levels of behavioral organization are interpreted in the context
   of intermittent exercise and locomotion whereby decreasing effort at one
   level of energy expenditure could allow for increased effort at another.
   Therefore, different (and sometimes opposite) responses to environmental
   conditions can occur at different levels of behavioral organization.
   Even when overall foraging effort remains unchanged, the strategy
   employed can differ in its temporal allocation or frequency, which Could
   be important in balancing energy budgets tinder increased energetic
   costs and/or time constraints. These results, have particularly
   important implications for interpreting behavioral responses
   investigated at only a single level of behavior, extrapolating data
   front brief observation periods to longer time scales, and foraging
   models which only consider single levels of behavior such as the dive
   cycle.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and aquatic insects have
   been monitored oil the River Laxa at Myvatn, from 1975 and 1977,
   respectively, tip to the present. The area holds the densest breeding
   population of this species in Iceland. The relationship between food
   abundance, reproductive success and density of breeding Harlequin Ducks
   were examined oil three sections (outlet, upper and lowland) of the
   Laxa. Spring density was highest Oil the lake Outlet (2.1 ha(-1)) and
   much lower oil the upper (0.3 ha(-1)) and lowland (0.4 ha(-1)) sections.
   Numbers of Harlequin Ducks on the Laxa increased significantly during
   the study period, 1975-2002. The trend of increasing numbers could be
   attributed to either a general, as yet unexplained, increase of
   Harlequin Ducks in northern and northeastern Iceland, or perhaps to the
   successful eradication of American Mink (Mustela. vison) breeding at the
   lake outlet (the main production centre of young Harlequin Ducks). Sex
   ratio in spring was 41\% females at the outlet and oil the upper Laxa
   but 36\% on tire lowland part. Yearling males were about 1\% of all
   males oil the upper river but 6-19\% on the lowland part. Most young
   were produced at the outlet, while few females or broods were found
   further down the liver. The mean total number of young produced annually
   at the Outlet was 74 +/- 11 (range = 9,235). Young per female present in
   spring at the Outlet and upper part was 0.49 +/- 0.09, or if only
   females at the Outlet in spring are considered, 0.82 +/- 0.17. Annual
   production of young was positively correlated with total yearly black
   (IN, abundance. We conclude that food limits the production of young in
   the Harlequin Duck. Changes in the densities of adults Oil the breeding
   grounds showed density dependence but were not significantly associated
   with food resources or previous production Of Voting.}},

Pages = {{92-103}},
Abstract = {{Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) breeding on the upper
   Torrent River of the northern peninsula of Newfoundland Were Studied
   from 1993 to 2002. This reach of the watershed was proposed for
   hydro-electrical development in the 1990s. Harlequin Ducks arrive oil
   the Torrent River as soon as ice-out permits in early to late May. Pairs
   concentrate in the upper watershed that drains the Long Range Barrens
   ecoregion. Nesting and,, although movements of more than brood rearing
   appear to take place primarily in proximity to spring-pair activity tell
   kill were observed. Young remain if] the Upper watershed until fledging
   in late August to mid-September. Counts of Harlequin Ducks breeding oil
   the Upper Torrent River increased throughout the 1990s, and the
   estimated population growth rate for the Torrent River birds was very
   similar to the growth rate for birds wintering at Cape St. Mary's,
   Newfoundland (1.14 vs. 1.13) (hiring the same period. Paired females
   spent similar to 40\% of the day in feeding activities whereas paired
   males allocated less time to feeding (similar to 19\%) and more little
   to alert or vigilant behaviors while females fed. Birds rested for
   35-40\% of the day. Harlequin Ducks exploited rapids, riffles and runs,
   and were especially associated with the boulder-strewn inlets; and
   outlets of ponds. The large quantities Of submerged and semi-submerged
   angular boulders provide increased surface area for attachments of
   larval insects, and movement of water through boulders assures high
   rates of oxygenation important to filter-feeding insects. Broods
   selected areas with flow rates of 1.27 +/- 0.24 m/s. The family
   Chironomidae contained the most taxa and was the most numerous
   invertebrate group found in the Torrent River. Chironomidae may comprise
   the most important food items for pre-nesting Harlequin Ducks when
   considering volume of prey types consumed. A high rate of brood
   production in 1997 and 1998, compared to adjacent watersheds, Suggests
   the possibility that the Torrent River system may behave as a source
   population for the general region of northern Newfoundland.}},

Abstract = {{The number of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) wintering in
   eastern North American is small, and little was known about these birds,
   especially their breeding distribution. During the breeding period, 990
   km of river and streams oil Newfoundland's North Peninsula was surveyed
   where 69 Harlequin Ducks were sighted. Breeding densities varied among
   watersheds (range 0-0.090 males/km), were slightly lower than elsewhere
   in eastern North America, and lower than in western North America and
   Iceland. A total of 128 +/- 45 males (indicated pairs) or 284 +/- 89
   birds (+/-95\% CI) was estimated to occur on the North Peninsula during
   the breeding season. This may represent 20\% of Harlequin Ducks
   wintering in eastern North America and highlights the importance of the
   Northern Peninsula as a breeding area for this rare duck.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Hydro-Quebec Grande-Baleine (Great Whale) hydroelectric
   project feasibility studies, Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus)
   surveys were conducted in 1996 and 1991 in the eastern Hudson Bay and
   James Bay drainage basins. A total of 142 and 420 Harlequin Ducks were
   Counted ill 1991 and 1992, respectively, of which 142 (199 1) and 356
   (1992) Were found in the area surveyed both years. Most individuals were
   in pairs and the overall sex-ratio did not deviate significantly from
   1:1. The highest numbers of Harlequin Ducks counted over the two),cars
   were found oil the Little Whale River, Des Loups-Marins Lake, and
   Nastapoka, A l'Eau Claire and Boutin Rivers. Highest pair densities were
   observed in June 1992 oil rivers located in tundra and forest tundra
   i.e., the lower Little Whale, A l'Eau Claire and Nastapoka Rivers, and
   near D'Iberville Lake. In 1992, pair densities varied between 0.003 and
   0.093 pair/km, depending oil the watershed, and followed a latitudinal
   gradient. Two broods were located in 1991 and three were found during a
   preliminary survey conducted in 1989. Broods were located on Boutin,
   Nastapoka, and Great Whale Rivers, as well as along the Hudson Bay
   coast. The difference in the number of Harlequin Ducks found in June
   1991 and 1992 may have been related to weather and methodological
   factors. Considering the vastness of northern Quebec and the limited
   area Surveyed during this study, we Suggest that Harlequin Ducks
   breeding in northern Quebec may well number in the thousands, and
   represent a very high proportion of the Greenland molting and wintering
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996, a Study to locate and describe breeding Sites, estimate pair
   densities and document brood movements of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus) was conducted oil selected rivers of the Gaspe Peninsula,
   Quebec. Pair densities oil the Port-Daniel, Sainte-Anne and Madeleine
   River systems were low: 0.32, 0.10 and 0.06 pairs/km, respectively. Six
   VHF radiotransmitters were implanted in nesting females oil the
   Port-Daniel and Sainte-Anne Rivers. Two Successful nests were located
   oil cliff ledges and one unsuccessful nest was located oil the ground
   oil all island. These nests represented the first recorded for the
   eastern North American Harlequin Duck population. Of the marked hens,
   two successfully hatched ducklings. One was followed for a month until
   the female was killed by a Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). The
   brood used a six kill stretch Of the Sainte-Anne River during that
   period. The other brood was tracked for two months and concentrated its
   activities along a three kill stretch of the Port-Daniel River. The
   female was located in coastal waters near Newport oil 24 August 1996.
   Two of the marked females from the Port-Daniel River and one from the
   Sainte-Anne River migrated to Bonaventure Island, where they likely
   molted. A female captured oil the Port-Daniel River was killed by a
   Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicencis) before its nesting status was
   confirmed. A female from the Port-Daniel River was located at the Sally
   islands, Maine, oil 5 December 1996. The study confirmed the importance
   of the Gaspe Peninsula Rivers for breeding Harlequin Ducks and the use
   of adjacent coastal molting sites by postbreeding females. It also
   established a link with the major Maine wintering area.}},

Abstract = {{Between November 1994 and November 1995, regular boat surveys for
   Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) were conducted on The Wolves
   archipelago in New Brunswick, Bay of Fundy. The birds arrived in early
   November and departed by mid-May, reaching a peak of 38 birds in March.
   Sex ratios tended to be close to unity, consistent with observations in
   Maine in the mid-1990s. Juvenile age ratios were noticeably higher than
   those observed at other wintering sites, suggesting that the juvenile
   birds may prefer The Wolves archipelago as a wintering site. Overall,
   these surveys confirm the importance of The Wolves archipelago as a
   non-breeding area for this species.}},

Abstract = {{Sea ducks have been captured with mist nets set across breeding streams
   and in drive traps at sea during the flightless period, but capture of
   flying birds on staging and wintering coastal areas presents a
   challenge. Here, we describe a highly successful technique for capturing
   Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) at sea, modified from a
   mistnet set developed to capture Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus
   marmaratus) at sea. While the original method was passive, decoys were
   added to attract birds and occasionally birds were driven toward the
   nets using small boats. The capture technique proved to be safe and
   effective. Three hundred and seventy-eight birds were captured during 28
   d of effort and no birds died in the net,; or during handling. The
   technique has been further modified to capture molting Harlequin Ducks.
   The technique and its modified version could be easily used to capture
   other sea ducks on their staging, wintering and molting areas.}},

Pages = {{138-146}},
Abstract = {{Capture-recapture data from a five-year field study of individually
   marked Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) wintering at Isle an
   Haut, Maine was used to examine patterns in age- and sex-specific
   apparent survival and local movements. Adult females had lower annual
   apparent survival probabilities than adult males. Survival probabilities
   for adult females were lower during the summer season than the winter
   season. Adult males showed no differences in apparent survival between
   the summer and winter intervals and survival during the winter season
   was similar for adult males and females. There was little evidence to
   Suggest differences in apparent survival between first winter males and
   females,although sample sizes, especially for first winter females, were
   small. Annual apparent. survival rates were lower for first winter males
   than adult males and likely reflected a combination of greater dispersal
   and higher mortality. Adult males captured in April in the study area
   disappeared from the study area more than adult males captured in
   November and may represent spring dispersal of unpaired males searching
   for mates or individuals from other wintering sites gathering before
   spring migration. Greater dispersal of adult and first winter males to
   adjacent wintering sites ill subsequent winters was noted than for adult
   females.}},

Pages = {{147-151}},
Abstract = {{Survival rates are an essential parameter for understanding the dynamics
   and Status of wild populations. Apparent survival (the combined
   probability of surviving and returning to a site) and capture rates were
   estimated for male Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus)
   (second-year, N = 30, adult, N = 83) that were captured and/or resighted
   on the Gannet Islands, Labrador, from 1999-2003. Most birds available
   for analysis were first captured locally (N 74), although a significant
   number were originally banded on wintering grounds in Maine (N = 36),
   and the remaining three were banded on breeding grounds. Second-year
   male apparent Survival rates were low (0.466 +/- 0.118; 95\% PLI: 0.256
   - 0.689), and different front adult rates (0.744 +/- 0.045; 0.647 -
   0.822), likely due to increased dispersal of young birds. There was
   little evidence for annual variation in survival rates, but samples
   sizes were low. Apparent survival rates of male Harlequin Ducks were
   lower than found in most studies, suggesting that some males emigrate
   from the Gannet. Islands molting site, but do confirm that there is some
   fidelity to molting sites, similar to observations of the Pacific
   population.}},

Title = {{Using Winter Juvenile/Adult Ratios as Indices of Recruitment in
   Population Models}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{152-158}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in using winter juvenile counts as
   indices of recruitment in species that show delayed plumage maturation,
   especially for species, such as dispersed breeders, for which it is
   difficult to obtain good productivity estimates. To date, however, the
   needed mathematical work to assist in interpreting these winter
   juvenile/adult ratios has not been conducted. A matrix-based population
   model is presented that is modified to allow the fecundity component to
   be measured ill mid- to late winter. This model is simplified to a set
   of equations that relate adult survival, winter juvenile/adult ratios
   and population growth rates, allowing all assessment of population trend
   with only one survival rate and age ratio data. These models have the
   advantage of not requiring that age of first breeding be well known. As
   all example, age ratios and survival rates of Harlequin Duck
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) populations in British Columbia and Maine
   are presented. Models for both populations suggest recruitment of young
   is insufficient to compensate for adult mortality, which is contrary to
   observed trends. Although some further methodological work is needed,
   such as better estimates of true adult survival and a further
   understanding of how to obtain unbiased estimates of juvenile/adult
   ratios, these models may prove to be a useful tool to assess population
   trends when detailed demographic data are not available.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better delineate affiliations between breeding, molting, and
   staging areas of the small Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus)
   population wintering in eastern North America, in April 2001 satellite
   transmitters were implanted in eight adult males at Isle an Haut, Maine,
   a major wintering area for this population. Two birds were confirmed
   breeding on rivers on the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec, two birds molted in
   northern Labrador, and four birds migrated to southwestern Greenland
   during the molting season, including one bird that bred in Quebec. The
   four birds tracked to southwestern Greenland likely molted there,
   although molting could be confirmed for only one bird. All birds tracked
   to Greenland, to breeding areas, and to molting locations returned to
   wintering sites in Maine the following wintering season. This study is
   the first confirmation of wintering male Harlequin Ducks from eastern
   North America molting in Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite telemetry was used to determine the migration patterns between
   breeding, staging, and molting areas of adult. male Harlequin Ducks
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) breeding in central Labrador during 2001 (N
   = 5) and 2002 (N = 6). Male Harlequin Ducks remained near their capture
   locations for an average of 19-20 d. Males spent an average of 18 and 34
   d on the Labrador coast in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and moved along
   the coast between several important staging areas prior to migration to
   Greenland. Male Harlequin Ducks may be completing a pre-basic molt prior
   to migrating to Greenland. Seven males migrated from the Labrador coast
   to three distinct molting areas in Greenland. All transmitters, expired
   by September preventing a confirmation of whether these males wintered
   in Greenland. The absence of hand sightings during winter in eastern
   Canada, especially Maine, indicates that some Harlequin Ducks breeding
   in central Labrador may also winter in eastern Greenland.}},

   Transmitters}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{183-187}},
Abstract = {{The recent use of abdominally-implanted satellite transmitters to track
   movements of waterfowl is rapidly filling gaps in our understanding of
   their population structure and affinities. However, premature loss of
   transmitter signals is of serious concern. Such loss occurred in 21 our
   of 25 satellite transmitters implanted in Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus) in 1996-4998. The tracking of eight birds captured while
   migrating along the shores of Forillon National Park, Gaspe Peninsula,
   Quebec, and the resightings of some of these birds after transmitter
   failure is detailed. The birds were followed for three to 373 d (mean =
   127 d, SD = 82 d) until transmitter signal was lost, but four birds were
   resighted 493 to 1,474 d after the surgical procedures. These results
   indicate that premature failure of the transmitter is a common cause of
   signal loss, even when the battery voltage is adequate at the time of
   loss. Harlequin Ducks drakes implanted with satellite radios are able to
   live long after the transmitter has failed.}},

Abstract = {{Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) were captured and measured
   at a variety of staging, breeding, molting and wintering sites across
   their Northwest Atlantic range from 1996-2002. The consistency in the
   body measurements taken oil the same birds across time and sites, as
   indexed by repeatability, was adequate (0.4-0.75), with the notable
   exception of total tarsus, which showed poor repeatability. Correlations
   among morphological measurements; were weak within each sex. Some
   differences among locations were detected, notably in wing length, with
   birds breeding in Labrador showing longer wings than birds breeding
   further south and those wintering in Maine. Overall, however, major
   differences among sites were not apparent. Recent satellite and banding
   information indicate that. many of these locations are linked and these
   observations are supported by this morphological data. Harlequin Ducks
   are similar to other ducks (except ciders) in that they are wide ranging
   and have disjunct populations, but show. at best, weak morphological
   differentiation across their range.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting distribution, abundance, and reproductive success of colonially
   nesting herons and egrets in the central coastal region of California
   surrounding the San Francisco Estuary were analyzed from 1991 to 2005.
   Nesting activity among nine major wetland subregions was compared with
   regard to nesting distribution, nest survivorship, productivity of
   Successful nests, habitat characteristics, and intraseasonal timing. An
   average of 73 active colony sites y(-1) supported approximately 62 Great
   Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) colonies, 25 Great Egret (Ardea alba)
   colonies, 13 Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nyclicorax nycticorax) colonies
   and twelve Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) colonies each year. Regional nest
   abundances were stable or increasing in all species. Annual changes in
   nest abundance were consistent with shifts in colony site preference as
   wetland suitability and disturbance patterns fluctuate across years and
   over space. Decreases in colony size were significantly related to
   higher rates of nest mortality, suggesting that conspecific nest failure
   may stimulate shifts in breeding distribution. A sharp decline in
   regional nest abundances Suggested the effects of reduced recruitment
   associated with increased juvenile mortality in winter, rather than a
   decline in productivity. Persistence of colony site use increased
   substantially at sites that reached at least 20 active nests.
   Subregional increases in nesting abundance coincided with the
   restoration of tidal marshes. Significant declines in regional
   reproductive success of Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night-Herons,
   and Snowy Egrets resulted primarily from declining nest survivorship,
   which coincided with regional increases in abundances of Common Ravens
   (Corvus corax). We found small but significant Subregional differences
   in nest survivorship, productivity, and overall reproductive success.
   Local and subregional productivity of Successful Great Blue Heron and
   Great Egret nests fluctuated within larger-scale variation across the
   region, whereas nest survivorship was associated with processes at local
   or subregional scales.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of California Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis
   californicus) along the coast of Oregon and Washington have increased
   sharply in recent years. We identified East Sand Island in the Columbia
   River estuary as the site of the largest pelican roost within this
   region. Numbers of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island have increased
   from less than 100 during 1979-1986 to a high count of 10,852 in 2002.
   The East Sand Island roost is currently the site of a major non-breeding
   aggregation of this endangered subspecies. Total numbers of pelicans
   roosting on East Sand Island increased seasonally from April to
   September or October, and then declined sharply with the onset of winter
   storms. Pelicans appeared to forage more during low tides, and return to
   the roost during high tides; therefore, pelican numbers on the island
   were positively associated with tide height. Land-based human
   disturbance was negatively associated with total pelican numbers,
   whereas water-based human disturbance had no significant effect on total
   pelican numbers on the island. Natural disturbances, although more
   frequent than human disturbances, apparently did not influence the total
   number of pelicans on the island.}},

Title = {{Timing of pairing in waterfowl I: Reviewing the data and extending the
   theory}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{488-505}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current male-costs hypothesis to explain variation in the timing of
   pairing in waterfowl acknowledges that relative parental investment and
   intra-sexual competition among males place females in control of pairing
   in most species. However, because females may benefit from early pair
   formation, it assumes that they should be willing to pair whenever males
   are energetically capable, and thus predicts that timing of pairing
   depends on decisions made by males. A compilation and review of
   available data on pairing behavior in waterfowl found little support for
   this hypothesis and considerable data that were inconsistent with its
   predictions. The mutual-choice hypothesis extends the male-costs
   hypothesis by incorporating cost-benefit trade-offs to females as well
   as males, and by giving invested into mate more consideration to the
   various components of the pairing process, including time and energy
   choice, the quality of mate chosen, and the state of being paired,
   including possible benefits of time spent gaining familiarity with a
   partner before breeding. This hypothesis differs from the male-costs
   hypothesis in two essential points: 1) that decisions by females rather
   than males primarily determine the timing of pairing, and 2) that it is
   necessary to incorporate the process of choosing a partner as well as
   the state of being paired. The new hypothesis or was supported by
   available data and by results of preliminary, comparative analyses, and
   provides a theoretical structure to describe phylogenetic trends in
   pairing behavior. However, critical testing of many predictions is
   currently hampered by a lack of longitudinal data on age- and
   sex-specific pairing chronologies using individual-based measures of
   pairing chronology.}},

Abstract = {{Intra-specific predictions of the male-costs and mutual-choice
   hypotheses to explain variation in the timing of pairing in waterfowl
   were tested in a longitudinal study of marked, known-aged Harlequin
   Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). Pairing chronologies and seasonal
   changes in time-activity budgets and rates of aggressive interactions
   were compared in relation to sex, age, and paired status. Results
   supported the mutual-choice and not the male-costs hypothesis. Paired
   females gained no immediate benefits relative to unpaired females from
   mate defense and vigilance, and there was no evidence that females
   preferred to pair as early as possible, as postulated by the male-costs
   hypothesis. Unpaired males spent much more time in courtship than paired
   males spent in mate defense and constraints on male time and energy
   budgets was not a plausible reason for delayed and protracted pairing of
   young and re-pairing females. As predicted by the mutual-choice
   hypothesis, decisions by females about how much time and energy to
   allocate to the pairing process appeared to be the main factor
   controlling the timing of pairing in Harlequin Ducks. Newly-pairing
   females invested an extended period of time in courtship and mate
   sampling before pairing, in spite of an abundance of courting males
   clearly energetically capable of maintaining a pair bond. Many young
   females decided to pair during mid-winter when time constraints to males
   should have been most severe. Time-budget trade-offs were apparent for
   young females and their date of pairing was related to the amount of
   time per day that they allocated to courtship. Pairing success of males
   was not related to their rate of courtship, nor was it related to the
   length of time they invested in courtship as they began courting while
   they were still immature and generally courted for several years before
   pairing.}},

Abstract = {{We describe and analyze the bird Community composition of the lacustrine
   water bodies of the seasonally flooded wetlands of the Mamiraua and
   Amana Reserves, Amazonas, Brazil. Bird surveys were conducted in 54
   water bodies within four water body systems aboard a speedboat, in July
   2003, at the peak of the high water season. We recorded 2,823
   individuals representing 79 bird species associated with aquatic
   environments, most]), resident; of these, 34 were aquatic (exclusively
   associated with aquatic environments), and 19 were primarily
   piscivorous. The aquatic bird Communities of Mamiraua and Amana comprise
   a few abundant species and a higher number of rare species. Seven
   species accounted for 71.7\% of all 34 aquatic birds recorded. In
   general, the more elongated the water bodies, the lower the aquatic and
   piscivorous bird species richness, and the lower the bird abundance.
   Piscivorous bird abundance was not significantly related to water body
   shape. Matrices of bird species by water body were Subjected to
   multivariate analysis using Principal Co-ordinate Analysis (PCoA). For
   the quantitative data (species abundance) and qualitative data (species
   presence/absence), the composition of the community of aquatic birds
   changed significantly among lacustrine water body systems, and was
   significantly affected by water body shape. The quantitative and
   qualitative composition of the piscivorous bird community did not change
   significant]), among water body systems, and were not affected by water
   body shape. The numerical analyses revealed a remarkably different
   behavior of the communities of aquatic birds and piscivorous birds, the
   former changing significantly with lacustrine water body morphology and
   local geography (water body system), and the latter being relatively
   insensitive to variation in these parameters. Water body shape is one of
   the determinants of aquatic bird community composition in the seasonally
   flooded wetlands of this part of Amazonia.}},

Abstract = {{The rainfall regime of the Pampas region of Argentina shows a long-term
   cyclic behavior that has increased in intensity over the historical mean
   during the last four decades. In this paper we explored the effects of
   changes in monthly cumulative rainfall on lagoon and riparian habitat,
   and, in turn on the wetland waterbird community. We also explored the
   responses of waterbird morphofunctional groups to fluctuation in water
   level and habitat diversity caused by the change in rainfall at the Mar
   Chiquita Coastal Lagoon, Argentina (37 degrees 32' to,37 degrees 45'S,
   57 degrees 19' to 57 degrees 26'W). Analysis of satellite images shows
   that increases in rainfall increased wetland water surface, but reduced
   riparian habitat area and habitat diversity. Increases in water surface
   negatively affected the abundances and species richness of waterbirds;
   habitat diversity did not explain a significant portion of total
   waterbird variability. Shorebirds (i.e., yellowlegs, plover, sandpiper)
   were the most affected by reduction in mudflats and habitat diversity.
   Other waterbirds (i.e., long-legged wading birds, waterfowls) were
   affected by increases in water surface (ducks, swans, long-legged
   waterbirds and gulls), decrease in mudflat availability (long-legged
   waterbirds and gulls), and decrease in habitat diversity (ducks). Our
   results show that the inter-annual variability in the rainfall pattern
   influenced the presence and abundance of most waterbirds, and species
   richness and composition. Fluctuation in water depth per se is known to
   be a key factor for habitat use of many waterbirds, but habitat
   diversity also needs to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of the presence and the frequency of canoe and
   pedestrian disturbance during two breeding seasons on multiple
   behavioral responses (scanning, freezing, grooming, sleeping, moving,
   wing-raising, and standing-up) of Black crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) nestlings in a breeding colony in southeast Chicago.
   Short-term responses (min) of Black-crowned Night Heron nesdings showed
   that they were sensitive to the presence of aquatic and pedestrian
   disturbance by increasing vigilant (scanning) and anti-predator
   (freezing) behaviors and decreasing maintenance (grooming, sleeping)
   behaviors. Nestlings were also sensitive to recreationist behavior, with
   less time allocated to sleeping and more time to freezing and scanning
   in the presence of inquisitive pedestrians than pedestrians who passed
   by the colony without stopping. However, medium-term responses (days)
   were insensitive to the frequency of disturbance, but spatial proximity
   to the source of disturbance influenced time scanning, sleeping, and
   freezing). Our results have wide implications for the protection of the
   Black-crowned Night Heron in States in which it is considered a species
   of conservation concern. We recommend that boating activities should be
   precluded during the initial part of the breeding season and buffer
   zones of 50 in should be established around the colony to minimize human
   disturbance. However, under these conditions, restrictions on the number
   of visitors during the breeding period may not be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Each spring, Black Scorers (Melanitta nigra), Surf Scoters; (M.
   perspicillata) and White-winged Scoters (M. fusca), pass through the Bay
   of Fundy in daytime on their northward migration to the sub-arctic
   breeding grounds. Their migrations along the Fundy coast were monitored
   from the Point Lepreau Bird Observatory at Point Lepreau, New Brunswick,
   from 1996 to 2004. Black Scoters migrated first (peak migration day:
   13-17 April), followed by Surfs (23-25 April) and White-wings (22-28
   April) which migrated together, although White-wings persisted over a
   longer period. Based on their rates of passage, we estimated the
   relative proportions of the wintering eastern North American populations
   of scoters, assumed to be of breeding age, which migrated by Point
   Lepreau each spring. We determined that 6-18\% and 28-37\% of the North
   American breeding populations of Surf Scoters and Black Scoters,
   respectively, utilized this northward migration route annually. The low
   numbers of White-wings (0.4-0.6\%) suggested that larger numbers of this
   species employed a different migration route in spring or migrated at
   night. This observatory offers an exceptional facility for monitoring
   this group of sea ducks, over time.}},

Abstract = {{Red, orange, and yellow carotenoid-based coloration abounds in birds,
   with over half of all avian orders known to display it in some form.
   Penguins (Order Sphenisciformes), however, are one order of birds which
   the proxinial causation of ornaments is unclear, i.e., whether such
   colors in plumage or bare-parts are caretenoid-based. We experimentally
   supplemented the diet of captive Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua for
   two months with extracts of krill, a common carotenoid-rich food source
   for these animals in the wild, to determine whether orange coloration in
   the beak and feet is influenced by carotenoid content of the diet. We
   found Using UV-Vis reflectance spectrophotometry that dietary carotenoid
   enrichment elevated beak but not foot brightness. This suggests that the
   crustacean part of the diet is at least in part responsible for orange
   beak coloration but not feet in Gentoo Penguins and that, like other
   carotenoid signals, these traits have the potential to reveal important
   aspects of mate quality (e.g., nutrition, health).}},

   water on the seaward side of the colony while Common Terns foraged in
   relatively shallow water between the colony and the mainland. The
   results of the diet stud), showed that chick diets overlapped
   significantly, with both species feeding mostly oil hake (Urophycis sp.)
   and sand lance (Ammodytes sp.). Despite the overlap in diet, Arctic
   Terns delivered proportionally more hake and less sand lance than Common
   Terns and the sand lance they delivered were smaller on average than
   those delivered by Common Terns. Overall, Arctic and Common terns at

Abstract = {{Until recently, our understanding of the role of movement in animal
   populations was limited due to a prevalence of studies on single local
   populations. Here we report on local and regional movement patterns of
   Razorbill (Alca torda), the least numerous Atlantic alcid, through the
   use of multi-site capture-mark-recapture/resight for five breeding
   locations spanning their entire North American breeding range. Razorbill
   philopatry and breeding site fidelity rates for the Gannet Islands,
   Labrador were high with 83\% of young birds (N = 340) and 97\% of adults
   (N = 149) returning to the same colony to breed. The distance moved
   between the natal colony and the colony where an individual later bred
   was significantly greater for birds handed as chicks, both between
   colonies on the same island and within islands in the Gannet Islands
   cluster. Regional movements of 40 banded individuals were recorded
   during 2003-2006, including seven birds that were confirmed breeding at
   a location different from their natal colony. Emigration distances among
   colonies in North America ranged from 57 to 1,737 kin, providing an
   unexpectedly high rate of movement of birds between breeding colonies
   that has not been previously reported for any auk species. One bird,
   banded as a chick on Digges Island, Nunavut in 1982 was recaptured 24
   years later as a breeder on the Gannet Islands (1,737 kin away). A chick
   banded on Handa Island, Scotland in 1971 was seen four times in 2004 at
   the Gannet Islands (3,210 kin away). Despite exhibiting low productivity
   and survivorship, Razorbill populations at some Atlantic Canada breeding
   sites have been increasing. We conclude that the dispersal and
   recruitment of individuals into new colonies that are characteristic of
   other seabird species may also partly explain patterns of population
   dynamics at North American Razorbill colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos)
   chicks hatched on rooftops interact with their environment is essential
   in the conservation of roof nesting colonies. We observed a colony of
   terns nesting on gravel roofs in Denton County, Texas, in 2003 and 2004.
   We Used focal sampling to examine how chicks behave in relation to
   Surface temperatures and in the presence of predators. We also placed
   two types of structures, artificial plants and wooden teepees, oil the
   roofs to determine whether chicks would use them for shade or For
   protection from predators. As surface temperature increased, chicks
   increased time Spent Under cover (whether a man-made Structure or being
   brooded) and decreased intraspecific interactions (ducking while an
   adult flew over, attacking or being attacked by other terns, submissive
   behaviors, and posturing). As chicks matured shade use decreased and
   body maintenance (preening and scratching) increased. When adults were
   mobbing potential predators over the colony, chicks ceased body
   maintenance, flight muscle preparation (stretching wings or flapping
   wings), and intraspecific interaction. Most chicks either fell prostrate
   where the), stood when mobbing began or ran away from the predator. The
   use of structures 1)), chicks did not change in the presence or absence
   of potential predators. Of the two experimental structures, only
   artificial plants were used more than expected. Overall, chicks hatched
   on roofs survive high surface temperatures by relocating to shade and
   survive predation by running or rising camouflage. Artificial plants may
   be important for providing shade but not for providing protection
   against predators.}},

Abstract = {{The Common Gull (Larus canus) is a typical breeding bird species of the
   Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, where it has
   declined substantially in recent decades. Since the mid-1990s, Common
   Gulls have started to colonize flat roofs of buildings, consisting
   mostly of gravel and small stones. The total number of roof-breeding
   Common Gulls in Schleswig-Holstein is estimated to be at least 400450
   pairs for the period 20002005, with further increasing trends. Minimum
   reproductive performance at two colonies in 2000 was 0.9 and 1.8 fledged
   chicks per nest. The diet at two colonies Studied in July 2001 consisted
   mainly of terrestrial food items. The most important prey categories
   were cherries, lumbricids, insects and bivalves. It is concluded that
   Common Gulls show a flexible response to environmental conditions by
   successfully exploiting a new breeding habitat, by reproducing
   successfully there and by taking benefit of their wide food spectrum to
   exploit man-made sites. Received 18 October 2006, accepted 20 November

   was more active and diverse in its foraging, fed more in upright
   posture, chose open, unvegetated sites more frequently, and was dominant

Abstract = {{Seabirds and other colonial waterbirds nesting in the northern Bahamas
   are nearly undocumented. This study is the first complete inventory of
   seabirds and other colonial waterbirds nesting ill the northern Bahamas
   (including the islands of the Abacos, Grand Bahamas, Biminis, and
   Berries). The survey found 20,267 nests of 19 species of seabirds and
   other colonial waterbirds at 113 colony sites. The over 40,000 seabirds
   and other colonial waterbirds found nesting in the northern Bahamas
   doubles population estimates previously published for The Bahamas as a
   whole, which included few of these sites. Sooty Tern (Sterna fuscata)
   was the most abundant species, having a nesting population of over
   10,000 pairs. Next most abundant were the Bridled Tern (Sterna
   anaethetus), Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla), and Brown Noddy (Sterna
   stolidus). This paper documents the first nesting record in the
   Commonwealth of The Bahamas of the White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), the
   first recent nesting in northern Bahamas of the Magnificent Frigatebird
   (Fregatta magnificens), and the first recent nesting in Grand Bahama of
   the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). Based on the results, 27
   sites may be recognized as of special importance to seabird conservation
   in the northern Bahamas. Opportunities for conservation, including
   community-based colony site stewardship and protection of the most
   important sites within twelve protected areas are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Super-normal clutches (five eggs or more) in the Caspian Gull (Larus
   cachinnans), Mediterranean Gull (Larus melanocephalus) and Whiskered
   Tern (Chlidonias hybyida) are described. These species have regularly
   bred in Poland since the beginning of the 1990s. The occurrence of
   super-normal clutches was 1.8\%, 4.1\% and 0.3\% in the Caspian Gull,
   Mediterranean Gull and Whiskered Tern, respectively. The first
   descriptions of a female-female pair in the above species as well as in
   the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) and an unusual mixed
   female-female pair of two gull species (Yellow-legged Gull and Caspian
   Gull), never mentioned in the literature before, are also presented. The
   first fully documented case of a multi-female association of the
   Mediterranean Gull was also identified. The frequency of the SNCs in
   this study was higher than in other colonies located in different parts
   of the geographical range of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The largest breeding colony of the endangered California Least Tern
   (Sterna antillarum browni) north of San Luis Obispo County occurs at
   Alameda Point, San Francisco Bay, California. Data on population size,
   reproductive success, and food habits were collected since the colony's
   inception in 1976, while more specific data on breeding chronology
   (dates of active nesting and nest initiation dates), clutch size,
   hatching success, and size of prey dropped at the breeding site were
   collected from 2000-2004. The number of breeding pairs increased by
   10.4\% per year, making this colony the largest colony in San Francisco
   Bay and representing 6\% of the state population. Breeding success
   varied but is generally superior to the state's combined productivity
   numbers. Of the 32 Least Tern sites monitored in 2004, only five other
   colonies had higher breeding success than Alameda Point in that year.
   Despite the colony's success, both hatching and breeding success have
   declined since the mid-1990s. Terns at this urban location forage in
   central and south San Francisco Bay, characterized by both marine and
   estuarine water. Dropped prey collected since 1981 indicate that
   silversides (family Atherinopsidae) were the most abundant prey in all
   years. Breeding success was positively correlated with the proportion of
   Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax, family Engraulididae), the second
   most common prey collected, suggesting that this high-energy fish may be
   beneficial to thes e terns. Potential factors limiting growth of this
   crucial northern Least Tern colony include predation and human
   disturbance, an inadequate protected nesting area, and environmental
   variability and its effects on prey abundance.}},

Abstract = {{We recorded and compared diurnal and nocturnal time-activity budgets of
   American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana), Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa
   flavipes), Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), and Wilson's Phalarope
   (Phalaropus tricolor) on 21 saline lakes in the Southern Great Plains,
   USA, during spring and summer/fall 2002 and 2003 to examine importance
   of saline lakes as migratory stopover sites. All four species spent most
   of their time feeding (47-70\%) and resting (7-37\%) by day and at night
   during spring and fall migrations. Little time was spent in other
   behaviors. Time budgets differed among species and between seasons,
   likely due to different energy needs. Time spent foraging varied
   seasonally between saline lakes and freshwater playas for American
   Avocets and Least Sandpipers, likely due to differences in vegetation
   cover and availability of prey between these wetland types. For most
   species, time spent foraging and resting differed between day and night.
   Therefore, extrapolating diurnal activity budgets to the entire 24-hour
   period and from one type of habitat to another within the same region is
   not recommended. Saline lakes are used by migrant shorebirds as stopover
   sites where they replenish lipid stores. Conservation efforts should
   focus on preserving these unique wetlands and the freshwater springs
   that discharge in them.}},

Abstract = {{The Gulf of Panama is a highly productive marine ecosystem at the
   southern edge of North America. Although the Gulfs aquatic bird
   populations have been remarked upon by ornithologists for over 50 years,
   nesting populations have been neither systematically studied nor
   completely characterized. In 2005 and 2006, the entire Gulf of Panama
   was inventoried to document the nesting status of seabirds and other
   colonial waterbirds. Over 50,000 birds of 20 species nesting at 57 sites
   were documented. Seabirds nested during the dry season, the period of
   oceanographic upwelling. Coastal colonial waterbirds nested at the end
   of the dry season and in the early wet season, when inland feeding
   habitats were optimal. Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) were the
   most numerous seabird with over 4,800 nests and 10,000 individuals
   counted. Over 3,600 Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus)
   nests and over 2,200 Magnificent Frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) nests
   were documented. Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) were the most abundant
   colonial wading birds, followed by Great Egrets (Ardea alba). Great
   Egrets were the first wading birds to nest, Cattle Egrets the last.
   Seven sites contained over 1,000 nests. Colony locations and numbers
   differed markedly from the historic literature. Some historic
   information is erroneous, but other differences reflect changes in
   distribution. More nesting Brown Pelicans and Sooty Terns (Sterna
   fuscata) and fewer Neotropic Cormorants were found than expected from
   the literature. New sites documented included some of global or regional
   conservation importance. This paper presents the first breeding records
   for Panama of Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Glossy Ibis
   (Plegadis falcinellus), and Bridled Tern (Sterna anaethetus), and third
   record for Cocoi Heron (Ardea cocoi). There is no evidence for long-term
   declines of seabirds or colonial wading birds in the Gulf of Panama.
   Populations reaching conservation thresholds globally or
   biogeographically include Brown Pelican, Bare-throated Tiger-Heron
   (Tigrisoma mexicanum), White This (Eudocimus albus), Glossy Ibis, and
   Bridled Tern. The Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nyct;corax)
   exceeded conservation thresholds for Central America. Six new sites of
   global importance for bird conservation were identified and the
   continued importance of another site confirmed. The continued health of
   the waterbird populations of Panama will depend on environmental
   education and protection of important colony sites from disturbance and
   development.}},

Abstract = {{During the 2003 breeding season 367 historic, potential, and current
   nesting sites of larids (Earn. Laridae) along the coast of western
   Mexico were surveyed. In 2004 and 2005, three areas: Guerrero Negro, in
   Baja California Sur; Marismas Nacionales, in Nayatit-Sinaloa; and Laguna
   Cuyutlan, in Colima were surveyed more intensively. In 2003-2005, there
   were nine nesting sites and probably between 200 and 300 breeding pairs
   of Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia); eleven confirmed nesting sites and at
   least 13,000 breeding pairs of Royal Tern (S. maxima); two nesting
   sites, one of which included almost the entire population, and 90,000
   breeding pairs of Elegant Tern (S. elegans); four nesting sites and
   about 20 breeding pairs of Forster's Tern (S. forsteri); and 13 nesting
   sites and about 1,000 breeding pairs of Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger).
   Breeding of Caspian and Elegant Terns on the Pacific coast of Mexico is
   confined to the northern areas, whereas that of Royal Terns and Black
   Skimmers occurs at selected sites along most of the coast. Forster's
   Terns nest in two widely separated areas, one in the northern section of
   the coast, and one in the southern section.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental acidification has been associated with factors that may
   negatively affect reproduction in many waterbirds. Declines in lake pH
   can lead to reductions in food availability and quality, or result in
   the altered availability of toxic metals, such as mercury. A recent
   laboratory study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and the
   Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources indicated that Common Loon
   (Gavia immer) chicks hatched from eggs collected on acidic lakes in
   northern Wisconsin may be less responsive to stimuli and exhibit reduced
   growth compared to chicks from neutral-pH lakes. Here we report on the
   relation between Common Loon egg characteristics (eggshell thickness and
   egg volume) and lake pH, as well as eggshell methylmercury content. Eggs
   (N = 84) and lake pH measurements were obtained from a four county
   region of northern Wisconsin. Eggshells were 34\% thinner on lakes with
   pH! <= 6.3 than on neutral-pH lakes and this relation was linear across
   the pH range investigated (P < 0.05). Egg volume also tended to be
   larger in eggs from neutral-pH lakes. Eggshell methylmercury content
   however was not significantly related to shell thickness (P > 0.05,
   n.s.) or lake pH. Results suggest that low lake pH may be associated
   with thinner eggshells and reduced egg volume in Common Loons. We
   speculate on the mechanisms that may lead to this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{For most ground-nesting seabirds, offshore islands usually serve as
   refuges from mammalian predators, however, introduced predators pose a
   substantial threat to many species. In New England, thousands of Herring
   Gulls (Laras argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) breed
   on hundreds of coastal islands. The Isles of Shoals (New
   Hampshire/Maine) archipelago has some of the largest colonies of both
   gull species in New England. In 2004, we noted unusually large numbers
   of failed nests on Appledore Island, Maine and hypothesized that
   Raccoons (Procyon lotor) were the cause. Therefore, we quantified egg
   and chick mortality and documented the presence of Raccoons. We trapped
   Raccoons on Appleclore and Smuttynose islands and conducted nest surveys
   on these and two other islands in the Isles of Shoals. Surveys of marked
   nests on Appledore Island revealed high levels of egg and chick
   mortality in early June 2004; by late June 58\% of nests were empty. We
   also found that on Applecore and Smuttynose, where Raccoons were
   observed, the odds that a nest would be empty were 17 times greater than
   on Lunging or Duck Islands where no Raccoons were observed. During 2004,
   eleven Raccoons were trapped off of Appleclore and Smuttynose Islands. A
   survey of nests in 2005 showed that gull breeding success increased
   significantly on Appledore and Smuttynose islands, whereas there was no
   significant change in the relatively high ratio of chicks to nests from
   2004 to 2005 on Lunging Island where Raccoons were not observed. Thus,
   we concluded that the presence of a few Raccoons on Appleclore and
   Smuttynose islands was sufficient to cause substantial breeding failure
   in large colonies of larids.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging habitat selection of nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and
   Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) was investigated within an estuary with
   extensive impounded salt marsh habitat. Using a geographic information
   system, available habitat was partitioned into concentric bands at five,
   ten, and 15 km radius from nesting colonies to assess the relative
   effects of habitat composition and distance on habitat selection. Snowy
   Egrets were more likely than Great Egrets to depart colonies and travel
   to foraging sites in groups, but both species usually arrived at sites
   that were occupied by other wading birds. Mean flight distances were 6.2
   km (SE = 0.4, N = 28, range 1.8-10.7 km) for Great Egrets and 4.7 km (SE
   = 0.48, N = 31, range 0.7-12.5 km) for Snowy Egrets. At the broadest
   spatial scale both species used impounded (mostly salt marsh) and
   estuarine edge habitat more than expected based on availability while
   avoiding unimpounded (mostly fresh water wetland) habitat. At more local
   scales habitat use matched availability. Interpretation of habitat
   preference differed with the types of habitat that were included and the
   maximum distance that habitat was considered available. These results
   illustrate that caution is needed when interpreting the results of
   habitat preference studies when individuals are constrained in their
   choice of habitats, such as for central place foragers.}},

Abstract = {{The Illinois and central Mississippi river valleys provide important
   habitats for migrating waterfowl. Unfortunately, both river systems have
   experienced large-scale hydrologic alterations, resulting in
   considerable loss of waterfowl habitat. To provide information to guide
   wetland conservation and rehabilitation efforts, we used data from
   aerial inventories of waterfowl conducted by the Illinois Natural
   History Survey to model Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) use in relation to
   wetland characteristics. Mallard use was positively associated with the
   proportion of wetland area classified as ``emergent{''} (e.g.,
   containing robust or moist-soil wetland vegetation) during spring and
   fall in both river valleys. Use by Mallards was also related to
   proportion of inventoried locations where hunting and other disturbances
   were prohibited during fall and spring, perhaps indicating better
   management of fall refuges to provide foraging habitat during spring. We
   suggest wetland habitat acquisition and rehabilitation efforts intended
   to benefit waterfowl emphasize emergent-wetland components. Further, we
   recommend investigations of wetland use by waterfowl in each river
   system to elucidate the role of areas where hunting and disturbance is
   prohibited.}},

   breeding initiation of Arctic Terns and Sabine's gulls was delayed until
   the breeding attempt was given up and the colony abandoned. However, the
   birds did not leave the region but returned to the colony soon after sea
   ice break-up continuing bonding behavior although egglaying was not

   breeding decision, as birds gradually gave up breeding and left the

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Dovekic (Alle alle) parents feed their chicks almost exclusively with
   high energy Arctic zooplankton associated with cold polar waters. In
   years with a stronger influx of warm Atlantic waters (positive NAO
   index) in their traditional feeding grounds, they may be forced to
   forage in suboptimal feeding areas. We compared the Dovekie chick diet
   in Hornsund (Spitsbergen) in the early, mid and late phases of the
   chick-rearing period in two seasons with different distributions of cold
   (Arctic) and warm (Atlantic) water masses. Parents delivered to their
   chicks food loads of lower wet weight (in the mid and late phase) and
   lower energetic value (in the late phase) under warm water conditions
   compared to colder water conditions. This suggests worse foraging
   conditions for Dovekies and foraging in suboptimal feeding areas during
   warm water events. However, data from the mid phase showed that Dovekies
   are able to compensate by increasing the number of daily feedings. In
   this phase, chicks received the same amount of food (by mass and energy)
   as in cold years. It is unknown how large the inflow of Atlantic water
   can be before it has negative implications for adult Dovekie daily time
   budget, body condition, survival rate, their breeding success and
   fitness.}},

Title = {{Tertial and upper wing covert molt in young American Black Ducks}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{433-440}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) molt some tertials and tertial
   coverts during their first fall and winter, but descriptions are
   incongruous and the timing, extent and sex-specific differences in molt
   patterns are largely unknown. We studied molt of these feathers from
   fall to spring using captive, harvested, and trapped wild birds, as well
   as specimen wings. During their first fall and winter, males molted
   earlier and replaced more tertials and tertial coverts than females, but
   all birds retained some juvenile tertial coverts until the end of April.
   We attribute these differences to their primary mating system of annual
   monogamy, with females being the limiting sex. The early acquisition of
   adult tertials and tertial coverts are likely selectively advantageous
   for males because these feathers are prominently displayed during
   courtship and pair bond formation. Young birds that have acquired
   adult-like feathers may exhibit a higher degree of fitness, facilitating
   breeding in the first year. This knowledge of wing feather replacement
   is useful for determining the age of Black Ducks as either second year
   or after second year and can also be used in dual feather isotope
   analysis to link natal and wintering areas.}},

Abstract = {{Waterbird surveys following the annual African Waterbird Census were
   conducted in the Antsalova region of western Madagascar from 2002 to
   2004. Seven wetland sites were monitored: five freshwater lakes, one
   alkaline lake and one marsh. Three of the five fresh water lakes were in
   the Manambolomaty Lakes Complex, a RAMSAR site. A total of 37,836
   individual birds were recorded belonging to 55 species representing 15
   families. The marsh had the highest waterbird abundance of all sites
   with an average of 3,616.3 +/- 461 individuals (N=3 years). Species
   diversity index was highest in the freshwater lakes with an average of
   2.53 +/- 0.07, and the lowest was recorded at Antsohale Lake with an
   average of 2.22 +/- 0.08. The waterbird abundance varied significantly
   between freshwater lakes and the marsh from 2002 to 2004, between
   freshwater lakes and the alkaline lake in 2003 and 2004, and between the
   alkaline lake and marsh. The net difference in species abundance between
   the Manambolomaty Lakes Complex and the other lakes varied
   significantly. In contrast, species richness between the Manambolomaty
   Lakes Complex and the other lakes did not vary. Several threatened
   species were at population levels observed ten years earlier.}},

Abstract = {{We trapped 656 Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) and measured five body
   dimensions and body mass for each bird; 313 birds were of known age, and
   229 were sexed by DNA. Males were larger than females in all five
   dimensions, but were smaller in body mass. Early-nesting birds were
   larger than late-nesting birds in all five dimensions: at least for wing
   length, this difference was related to both laying date and age. Head
   length (from back of skull to tip of bill) was the most useful measure
   for sexing Common Terns in the field. Discriminant functions indicated
   that 75.9\% of single birds and 84.5\% of pairs could be sexed correctly
   by head length alone. We present rules and nomograms for field sexing of
   Common Terns; these provide trade-offs between sensitivity (proportion
   of birds classified) and specificity (proportion of birds correctly
   sexed). Three of 80 pairs (4\%) included two females: these pairs nested
   early and were at least as successful as male-female pairs. Within
   pairs, tarsus lengths were negatively correlated; we found no evidence
   for positive assortative mating by linear dimensions or body mass. This
   study confirms some previous reports of sexual dimorphism in this
   species based on less reliable methods of sexing, but fails to confirm
   other reports of sexual dimorphism and assortative mating.}},

Abstract = {{We used DNA markers to determine the sexes of 449 breeding adult Black
   Terns (Chlidonias niger) captured and measured in southeastern Wisconsin
   from 2000 to 2005. Various morphometric discriminant functions were then
   generated to classify the sexes of these birds. Other objectives were to
   examine the effect of sample size on the predictive ability of
   discriminant function analysis (DFA), to evaluate the temporal stability
   in the accuracy of DFA for a specific population, and to test the
   geographic specificity of DFA by comparing separate breeding colonies in
   southeastern Wisconsin and also by applying a discriminant function,
   derived from an Oregon population, to terns in Wisconsin. The best
   discriminant function included head-plus-bill length and body mass, and
   correctly classified 81\% of the birds in the complete sample.
   Within-pair comparisons increased the classification accuracy to 87\%,
   because males usually were larger than their mates with respect to
   head-plus-bill length. Sample-size analysis indicated that a
   satisfactory discriminant function for Black Terns could be generated
   from a sample of only 10\% of the population. Region-wide,
   classification accuracy was similar among years, indicating temporal
   stability, but the accuracy of prediction for females tended to erode
   over time at specific colonies. Discriminant functions generated from
   birds captured at one site performed equally well on neighboring
   populations, but the Oregon function performed poorly on the Wisconsin
   population. Our findings suggest that a discriminant function derived
   from morphometrics of a single population can be applied to other
   populations in a limited geographic region but its utility may decrease
   over time. Our results also validate the previous cautions that
   geographic variation in the biometry of a species precludes the use of a
   single discriminant function on widely disjunct populations.}},

Abstract = {{We recorded the daily presence of Double-crested Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax auritus) at the nesting island on Oneida Lake, New York,
   by monitoring the activities of 15 radio-tagged adults from July through
   September, 2000, using an automated data-logging receiver. A total of
   24,464 acceptable detections was obtained for adult cormorants actively
   attempting to nest on the lake. Tagged cormorants had a bimodal daily
   activity pattern during the first month, with the fewest birds detected
   on the island at 09.00 h and 15.00 h Eastern daylight time. The pattern
   of activity appeared to change slightly in the second month of the
   study, representative of a post-breeding period for the colony, with a
   shift from a less synchronous pattern of departures to a greater focus
   on morning activity also centered around 09.30 h. These results
   correspond with daily observations of Great Cormorant (P carbo) foraging
   activities reported for colonies in Africa and Poland. The data also
   support the possibility of nocturnal foraging activity, not previously
   reported for this species on their summer breeding grounds. No
   correlation was found between total number of daily detections and
   climatalogical factors or events.}},

Abstract = {{Male Scarlet Ibises (Eudocimus ruber) and White Ibises (Eudocimus albus)
   have bills that are on average 22\% longer than females, yet only half
   of this difference can be attributed to body size differences. In this
   work it is suggested that the sexual dimorphism in bill length and bill
   shape is based in large part upon the role of bill length in determining
   the outcome of male bill-sparring contests. Sexual differences in bill
   morphology and behavior were investigated in a captive flock of 350
   Scarlet Ibises. In 29 instances of males sparring with males in contests
   prior to breeding and in 11 instances of nest take-over during breeding,
   no significant differences in age, body size, or body condition between
   winning and losing males were found. However, males winning
   bill-sparring contests and nest take-overs had significantly longer
   bills than losing males. Longer billed males also bred significantly
   earlier than shorter billed males in captivity. Sexual differences in
   the relationship between bill curvature, bill chord and bill length
   suggest that male Scarlet and White Ibises are under selection for
   increased bill length. In addition, among 16 of 23 ibis species for
   which information was available, sexual dimorphism in bill length was
   positively associated with colonial nesting but was not associated with
   group foraging. This result supports the theory that close proximity
   during nesting is one feature that may facilitate bill sparring between
   males, resulting in selection for longer bills.}},

Abstract = {{We used Pacific Loon (Gavia pacifica) and Red-throated Loon (G.
   stellata) nests with known ages to gauge the efficacy of egg flotation
   for determining nest age in coastal Alaska. Egg flotation accurately
   estimated nest age for both species; the mean +/- 1SD difference between
   known age and age determined with egg flotation was 0.05 +/- 2.00 d and
   -0.02 +/- 1.63 d for Pacific and Red-throated Loons, respectively. Day
   of nest initiation did not influence the relationship between known nest
   age and nest age estimated with egg flotation, indicating incubation
   period was not shortened in nests initiated later in the season.
   Additionally, we found no difference in the ability of egg flotation to
   estimate nest age between two widely dispersed study sites for Pacific
   Loons, and only a small difference between two of three widely dispersed
   study sites for Red-throated Loons. Thus, our described relationships
   between egg flotation categories and nest age should be broadly
   applicable for these holarctic species. We conclude that for Pacific and
   Red-throated Loons, egg flotation is a useful technique for determining
   nest age in the field to better monitor nest fate, and to quantify nest
   age effects on nest daily survival}},

Abstract = {{During the 2003 and 2005 breeding seasons we conducted ground surveys of
   historical, potential, and current nesting sites of the VanRossem's
   Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica vanrossemi) along the Pacific
   coast of Mexico. We documented 13 active colonies, including ten
   previously unrecorded nesting sites. One previously reported colony was
   inactive. Colony sizes ranged between one and 161 breeding pairs. In
   2005, the estimated breeding population size was 526 pairs. Eighty-two
   percent of the total breeding population was concentrated in three
   relatively large colonies, Cerro Prieto and Isla Montague, Baja
   California and Laguna Las Garzas, Nayarit. Gull-billed Terns nested
   mostly on islets in very shallow waters. Colony associates included
   other terns, Black Skimmers (Rhynchops niger), gulls, and egrets. The
   nesting population of this subspecies in Mexico is very small and
   consists of a few widely separated colonies. This subspecies should be
   included in Mexico's official list of species at risk, and a management
   plan should be developed and implemented to assure its conservation and
   that of the wetland habitat on which it and other bird species depend.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the molt migration of the Surf Scorer (Melanitta
   perspicillata), a species endemic to North America. Our objective in
   this study was to document the breeding and molting chronology of Surf
   Scoters in Quebec. Breeding birds were studied at Lake Malbaie, located
   about 90 km north of Quebec City, Canada. Surf Scorers arrived at Lake
   Malbaie in the fourth week of May and most males stayed only for
   approximately three weeks. This relatively early departure of males from
   the breeding areas emphasizes the importance of saltwater habitats for
   these birds. Unsuccessful adult females did not leave with the males but
   remained on their breeding lake. These females left the lake from mid to
   late July, nearly a month after the departure of males and much earlier
   than females with broods which left from mid to late August after
   abandoning their brood. This departure sequence was observed during the
   three years of the study. The difference in timing of molt migration
   between age and sex groups has important management implications as it
   potentially exposes them to different levels of mortality. For example,
   late molters, mostly adult females that bred successfully may still be
   flightless at the beginning of the hunting season in some areas. Better
   understanding of molt chronology and habitat selection by various sex
   and age groups will permit a more holistic and efficient management of
   Surf Scoters.}},

Abstract = {{Barrow's (Bucephala islandica) and Common (B. clangula) goldeneyes
   winter in large numbers in the St. Lawrence estuary and little is known
   of their distribution and diet. The objective of the study was to
   characterize how these two similar species, co-existed in the St.
   Lawrence estuary during the non-breeding season. Their local
   distribution, diet, and dive efficiency were compared. There was little
   overlap in habitat use by both goldeneyes. Their distribution was not
   correlated in the autumn (r = 0.04) but was in the spring (0.68). Autumn
   and spring distributions were more correlated in Common Goldeneyes (r =
   0.82) than in Barrow's Goldeneyes (r = 0.49). Both species moved to the
   north shore of the estuary during January and February 1999 as south
   shore intertidal areas froze. Barrow's Goldeneyes foraged in larger
   flocks than Common Goldeneyes ((x) over bar = 20.3 vs 9.8 birds) and
   flocks were larger in autumn than spring. Both species fed on amphipods
   but differed in their use of gastropods (Barrow's Goldeneye) and
   polychaetes (Common Goldeneye). Dive duration was similar in both
   species but varied between areas. Pause duration was shorter in Common
   Goldeneyes than in Barrow's Goldeneyes but was not affected by area.
   Dive efficiency was higher in Common Goldeneyes than Barrow's Goldeneyes
   and varied between areas. The predominance of polychaetes in the diet of
   Common Goldeneyes and of amphipods in the diet of Barrow's Goldeneyes
   had not been highlighted before. These species provide a good example of
   niche differentiation between closely related species.}},

Abstract = {{The Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) population in the
   North American Great Lakes region has increased substantially during the
   past three decades. Cormorants are likely recovering after a period of
   human-caused suppression; however, their resurgence has raised concerns
   regarding potential negative interactions with other waterbirds. To
   examine this issue, we compared measures of nesting success and
   aggressive behavior in Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) nesting on two
   artificial islands in Hamilton Harbour, western Lake Ontario. Only
   breeding Herring Gulls occupied the first island, whereas a mixed colony
   of both Herring Gulls and cormorants occupied the second. Over three
   years, Herring Gulls in the single-species colony had greater nesting
   success than those in the colony shared with cormorants. Gulls in the
   mixed colony had more nests that contained cormorant eggs in addition to
   Herring Gull eggs, or that were usurped by cormorants. Analysis of
   individual Herring Gull egg fates revealed lower hatching rates and more
   eggs displaced from nests in the mixed colony. Due to the presence of
   cormorants, gulls in the mixed colony engaged in more aggressive
   interactions near their nests than those in the single-species colony.
   We conclude that at our study site cormorants were competing directly
   with Herring Gulls for nest sites and nesting material, and contributing
   to reduced Herring Gull reproductive success in the mixed colony. Our
   results suggest that interactions between species in mixed colonies may
   be more subtle than the displacement of breeding adults, and may not be
   detected by examining nest counts alone. We suggest that further studies
   examine cormorant interactions with other colonial bird species at
   additional sites.}},

Abstract = {{Endangered Interior Least Terns (Sterna antillarum athalassos) and
   threatened Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) nest in Nebraska at
   gravel mines where they are vulnerable to disturbance and nest loss.
   Conflicts occur when their nesting and protected status delay mining
   activities. The possibility of shifting nesting from active to inactive
   mining areas by using a deterrent (mylar flagging), an attractant
   (gravel and driftwood spread on bare sand), and a control (untreated
   sand) was evaluated. Experimental plots (mean 0.36 ha) were established
   at 18 different gravel mines, twelve in 2000 and seven (one repeat) in
   2001 along the Platte and Elkhorn rivers prior to nesting season. Of 117
   tern nests, 73\% were in attractant, 2\% in deterrent, and 26\% in
   control plots. Of 23 plover nests, 61\% were in attractant, 9\% in
   deterrent, and 30\% in control. Colonies used plots containing less
   vegetation and more driftwood than unused plots. Within control plots,
   both tern and plover nests were Surrounded by more large (> 15 min)
   gravel and less coarse sand than was available at random points. Within
   attractant plots, substrate at the nest did not differ from random
   points. In all plots, Least Tern nests were more likely to have
   driftwood by the nest than was available at random points. Hatching
   rates did not differ between attractant and control plots. To attract
   Least Terns and Piping Plovers, sand covered with 15\% small gravel,
   5-10\% large gravel, < 3\% vegetation, and about ten pieces
   driftwood/1,000 m(2) was found to be effective. As deterrents, mylar
   streamers 7 in long, 30 min wide, and 0.025 min thick, attached to I in
   poles arranged in a 7 in grid were used. The combination of attractant
   and deterrent treatments provided a mechanism to protect nesting birds
   and avoid conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Southern Rockhopper (Euduples chrysocome chrysocome) and
   Macaroni (E. chrysolophus) Penguins at key breeding sites in the
   Southern Hemisphere have declined substantially in the past 50 years,
   but their statuses at important breeding sites in southern Chile are
   poorly known. In 2002, at two of the largest breeding sites in Chile,
   the Ildefonso and Diego Ramirez Archipelagos, we determined the number
   of breeding pairs. Based on nest density checks (quadrat and/or
   point-distance techniques) in a sample of habitats and calculations of
   the areas of occupied terrain, we estimated there were 86,400 (CL95\%:
   54,000 to 135,000) Rockhopper pairs and 5,660 (2,280 to 11,900) Macaroni
   pairs at Ildefonso, and 132,721 (88,860 to 185,665) Rockhopper pairs and
   about 15,600 Macaroni pairs at Diego Ramirez. Combined, the archipelagos
   hold about 28\% of the world population of Southern Rockhopper Penguins.}},

Abstract = {{Thirteen Blue-footed Boobies (Sula nebouxii) born on Isla Isabel,
   Nayarit, Mexico, nested on Isla El Rancho, Sinaloa. This natal dispersal
   of about 450 km was unknown for this species. Recruitment of these
   breeders appeared to happen at between four and seven years of age,
   slightly higher than the recruitment age reported for Isla Isabel birds
   that remain there. Age at first detection did not differ between males
   and females. Immigration to Isla El Rancho could relate to the recent
   establishment of this colony, and its continuous growth during the last
   five years. Since there doesn't seem to be a shortage of nesting sites
   at Isla Isabel, long distance natal dispersal may be a normal trait in
   this species of booby.}},

Abstract = {{In June 2000, an oiled Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus melodus), part
   of the endangered eastern Canadian population, was caught and banded,
   and a second oiled individual was observed at Flat Bay (48 degrees 26 `
   N; 58 degrees 32 ` W) in southwestern Newfoundland. These are the first
   documented cases of oiled Piping Plover in Canada. The banded plover was
   subsequently recaptured in July 2001, and appeared healthy. Evidence of
   another individual surviving exposure to oil was documented in 2005 in
   Nova Scotia. This suggests that Piping Plovers are vulnerable to oil
   pollution but may have some capacity to survive minimal oiling.}},

Abstract = {{Tiger Herons (Tigrisoma) are little studied and generally characterized
   in the literature as being relatively uncommon birds of forested streams
   and wetlands. Contrary to these expectations, we found Bare-throated
   Tiger Herons (Tigrisoma lineatum) on the Pearl Islands of the Gulf of
   Panama to be birds of open, wave-exposed rocky seashores. We also found
   them to be common birds, inhabiting most shoreline coves. They fed over
   much of the tidal cycle along beaches and rocky shores, especially on
   and near surf-washed rocks. They caught crabs and fish by standing and
   walking slowly and methodically. Feeding efficiency was low, averaging
   about one prey item per hour. Plumage coloration is highly cryptic
   against shore rocks; but, in contrast, the bird becomes quite obvious
   when it expands its bare yellow throat, especially when accentuating a
   distinctive stretch display used to claim shoreline territory and for
   within-pair interactions. Tiger herons in the Pearls nested high in
   trees on ocean-facing cliffs. The habitat choice and behavior of this
   population of tiger herons that we report extend understanding of the
   biological scope of the subfamily of tiger herons.}},

Abstract = {{American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchas) that breed on Anaho
   Island, Pyramid Lake, Nevada, are potentially exposed to a variety of
   contaminants. Therefore, the reproductive success of this colony was
   monitored in 1996 and eggs, blood and feathers from nestlings, livers
   from adults and nestlings, regurgitated fish from nestlings, and fish
   from representative feeding areas were collected and analyzed for
   mercury and selenium to determine exposure to the pelicans and sources
   of contamination. Additional samples were collected and analyzed in
   1988, 1992, and 2004. Reproductive success at the Anaho Island colony
   was normal in 1996 based on hatching rates of eggs (>= 75\% in
   undisturbed areas) and survival of nestlings. Mercury and selenium
   concentrations in eggs were generally below known effect levels and did
   not appear to have an adverse impact on hatching success. Mercury and
   selenium concentrations in fish ranged widely, with mercury of greatest
   concern. Microscopic lesions characteristic of mercury toxicity were
   absent in pre-fledging nestlings in 1996. Some adult pelicans bad
   elevated mercury concentrations in their livers; however, the potential
   toxic effects were difficult to evaluate because of probable
   demethylation of mercury, thereby possibly providing protection from
   toxicity. Exposure of pelicans to mercury varied among years, most
   likely in relation to wet-dry cycles and available feeding areas.}},

Abstract = {{The Xisha Archipelago, South China Sea, was surveyed for waterbirds in
   March-April 2003 and April-August 2004. Forty-five waterbird species
   were recorded, making a grand total of 53 species for the Archipelago
   when earlier published records are included. The Archipelago is of great
   importance for the Red-footed Booby (Sula sula), with an estimated 10\%
   of the world population breeding on Dong Island. Other breeding seabird
   species were Great Frigatebird (Fregata minor), Great Crested Tern
   (Sterna bergii) and Sooty Tern (S. fuscata), and it is believed that
   Black-naped Tern (S. sumatrana) and Roseate Tern (S. dougallii) also
   breed there. Compared to 1926, the number of seabirds, and the islands
   on which they breed, has declined greatly. The data for Ardeidae and
   shore-birds provide information on migration and, possibly, wintering
   strategies of these species. Despite habitat degradation and human
   disturbance, the Xisha Archipelago is still important for breeding
   seabirds and there is an urgent need to improve the conservation status
   of this bird group.}},

Abstract = {{White-eared Night-heron (Gorsachius magnificus) is the most threatened
   and geographically restricted of the herons. Its biology is essentially
   unknown. On 24 May 2004, six adults and four juveniles were found for
   the first time at Thousand Island Lake, Zhejiang Province, P. R. China.
   In all, six nests and sixteen eggs were found over three years. Thirteen
   nestlings survived to fledging from seven breeding pairs. These numbers
   are the largest ever documented for the species. Our observations of
   breeding performance serve as an important baseline for future research

Abstract = {{There have been no detailed studies on reproductive biology of the Great
   Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We
   conducted such investigations during the breeding seasons of 1999 and
   2000 in Qinghai-Lake Bird Isle, China. Great Cormorants began to migrate
   to Qinghai-Lake for reproduction from the middle of March and left from
   early October at the end of reproduction. Nesting periods were from
   early April to mid June and took 50 days. Egg-laying occurred during the
   three weeks from the end of April to 20 May. Females typically laid an
   egg every 1-2 days until clutch completion. Mean clutch size in the
   study area over two years was 3.3 (SE +/- 0.13, N = 68, range 1-5) and
   most (66.18\%) fell within the range 3-4 eggs. Length of eggs averaged
   61.01 mm and breadth averaged 34.13 mm. Fresh egg weight averaged 57.34
   g (SE +/- 0.36, range 46.0-73.7 g, N = 179). Hatching success was 48.7\%
   and fledging success was 64.9\% over two years. Decline of available
   fish resources in Qinghai-Lake might be one of main causes of lower
   reproductive success. The causes of chick loss were possibly high
   altitude, high winds and prolonged rain.}},

   minor): Comparison of behavioral sampling techniques}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{310-316}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We recorded the diurnal behaviors of the endangered Black-faced
   Spoonbill (Platalea minor) for 16 days during the wintering season in
   Jeju Province, Korea to find an appropriate and effective sampling
   technique for behavioral study. Two main techniques were used and
   compared: focal sampling with continuous recording and scan sampling
   with instantaneous recording at various time intervals. As a result,
   recording the behavior of a focal bird for more than 20 min per h was
   the best technique with high accuracy and precision. However, to select
   less time- and labor-intensive techniques we concluded that scan
   samplings with less than 10 min intervals or focal samplings with more
   than 15 min durations are appropriate measurements of the spoonbill's
   behaviors. Considering sampling sizes, scan sampling with 5 min
   recording intervals can be an effective technique but additional methods
   are also required to obtain significant information for infrequent or
   occasional behaviors. We suggest that each sampling technique should be
   validated by preliminary or supplementary surveys to estimate the
   endangered animal's behaviors and this can be an important part of the
   groundwork for conservational efforts on the Black-faced Spoonbill.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{We documented nest habitat selection, nests success, and factors
   affecting nest success of Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) at Agassiz
   National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern Minnesota. During 1992-1994,
   289 Black Tern nest sites and 400 random sites were sampled on five
   search areas totaling 1,325 ha. Four habitat characteristics were
   measured at each nest and random site: (1) mean water depth, (2)
   distance to open water, (3) dominant vegetation within a 2-m radius, and
   (4) amount of open water within a 2-m radius. Habitat variables were
   highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to estimate
   independent effects of each habitat variable on nest-site selection.
   However, conditional logistic regression models indicated that locations
   closer to open water and in deeper water were more likely to be
   associated with nest sites. Locations in bulrush (Scirpus acutus) and
   sedge/grass were preferred, although 68\% of nests were in cattail
   (Typha spp.) reflecting the greater availability of that habitat in the
   study area. Nest success ranged from 48-69\% (Apparent) and 33-62\%
   (Mayfield) among years. Except for five nests that were abandoned or had
   infertile eggs, nests that failed to hatch apparently were deprecated.
   Nest success was higher for nests with larger clutch sizes and for nests
   located farther away from other nests. Nests with 3-egg clutches were
   2.8 times as likely to hatch as 2-egg nests. The odds of a nest being
   successful increased by 25\% for each 5 in increase in distance to the
   nearest nest. Earlier nests were also more successful (the odds of a
   nest being successful was estimated to decrease 7\% for each additional
   day that passed before the nest was initiated). Nest success was not
   related. to nest cluster size and was negatively related to habitat
   factors associated with nest site-selection.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the ontogeny of the sex ratio is required for proper
   framing of evolutionary hypotheses regarding adaptive parental sex
   allocation, competition for mates, evolution of mating systems, and
   endangered species management. We traced the development of a
   male-biased adult sex ratio in Nazca Boobies (Sula granti) by
   determination of the sex ratio at hatching, fledging, and at returning
   to join the adult population. The sex ratio at hatching and fledging did
   not differ from unity, while the return sex ratio was significantly
   male-biased. Therefore, the observed adult sex ratio bias arises after
   the period of parental care ends, during the subadult/juvenile stage,
   with important implications for mate competition.}},

Abstract = {{Colonial seabirds such as alcids often do not rapidly recolonize former
   breeding habitat following extirpation of nesting colonies. Social
   attraction (e.g., use of decoys, recorded vocalizations and mirrors)
   artificially stimulates nesting by providing social cues that encourage
   colonization. Common Murres (Uria aalge) stopped breeding at Devil's
   Slide Rock, San Mateo County, California following the 1986 Apex Houston
   oil spill. Natural recolonization did not occur between 1987 and 1995.
   Common Murres began regular visits to Devil's Slide Rock within 24 hours
   of social attraction equipment installation in January 1996 and six
   pairs nested by June 1996. Over 90\% of murre observations were in decoy
   plots in contrast to control plots and outside of plots where few murre
   observations occurred. Significantly more murre presences versus
   absences were recorded in low density decoy plots and these birds most
   often frequented open areas (aisles) within decoy clusters.
   Significantly larger groups of murres visited high density decoy plots
   and aisle sub-plots. Murre densities were significantly greater within
   30 cm of mirrors. Five of six nests were within 60 cm of mirrors. Nests
   coincided with areas where prior nesting and last pre-1996 attendance
   had been concentrated. Rapid breeding response combined with recent
   nonbreeding attendance suggests that the first colonists may have been
   surviving breeders from the original colony or young produced at the
   rock prior to the oil spill. The initial recolonization event and
   continued restoration efforts have prompted further colony growth to 190
   pairs nesting by 2004. This study suggests that social stimuli can limit
   natural colonization of otherwise suitable habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Gull predation is an important source of egg and chick mortality for
   many seabirds. From 2003-2005, the effects of gull predation and a
   predator control program on tern nesting success were studied at Eastern
   Egg Rock, Maine. In 2003, gull predation was uncontrolled, and in 2004
   and 2005, attempts were made to shoot Herring (Larus argentatus), Great
   Black-backed (L. marinus), and Laughing (L. atricilla) gulls that preyed
   on Common (Sterna hirundo), Arctic (S. paradisaea), and Roseate (S.
   dougallii) tern adults, eggs, and chicks. To evaluate the effectiveness
   of gull removal, daily watches were performed from an observation tower
   and tern hatching and fledging success were measured annually. Despite
   shooting efforts in 2004-2005, many known predators could not be
   removed. Great Black-backed Gull predation was a function of year, tidal
   state, and visibility, while Herring Gull predation depended only on the
   stage of the tern breeding cycle. Using disappearance of eggs and chicks
   from monitored nests as a proxy for gull predation pressure, an
   estimated 23\% of Common, 32\% of Arctic, and 6\% of Roseate tern nests
   were deprecated by gulls during the study period. Predation risk
   depended on nest position within the colony, but not year, with some
   areas consistently more vulnerable to gulls than others. We discuss the
   difficulty of removing predatory gulls from a tern colony lacking
   nesting Herring and Great Black-backed gulls and suggest the importance
   of human presence and associated research activities for reducing gull
   predation at this site.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed temporal and spatial trends in annual nest counts of Brown
   Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), Royal Terns (Sterna maxima), and
   Sandwich Terns (Sterna sandvicensis) throughout South Carolina from 1969
   through 2005. There was an increase in the number of active pelican
   nests from 1969 through the mid 1980s, although this was followed by a
   steady decline that continued through 2005. Numbers of Royal Tern nests
   have declined during the study period, especially since 1990. In
   contrast, annual counts of active Sandwich Tern nests remained
   relatively stable through the mid 1980s, then increased substantially
   and have since remained stable. During the early years of the study, a
   greater proportion of nests from each species occurred on colonies
   within the Cape Remain region, although this distribution appears to
   have shifted with a greater proportion of nests now occurring along the
   southern coast. At the statewide level and at each of the primary
   colonies, we observed a positive correlation in counts of Brown Pelican
   and Royal Tern nests. Mechanisms underlying the observed trends are
   unclear. We suggest that priorities for research include (1)
   determination of diet and foraging locales for all three species, (2)
   impacts of ectoparasites on condition and survival of pelican chicks,
   and (3) metapopulation structure of all three species. Management
   activities should focus primarily on protection of colony sites.}},

Abstract = {{Studies using stable-isotope analyses of feathers to determine molt
   locations in marine birds are increasingly common but generally lack
   verification through ground-truthing. In this study, we examined the
   stable isotope compositions of wing feathers from King Eiders (Somateria
   spectabilis) implanted with satellite-transmitters. We compared stable
   carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta
   N-15, and delta D, respectively) of primary feathers with the geographic
   location of wing molt in the subsequent year. Longitude of molt
   locations of ciders was highly correlated with delta C-13 (r(2)= 0.69, N
   = 12) and delta D (r(2)= 0.90, N = 12) isotope values from their primary
   feathers grown in the previous year. There was no relationship between
   delta N-15 and location of wing molt (r(2) = 0.007, N = 12). The results
   of this study provide further evidence for site fidelity during wing
   molt by King Eiders.}},

Title = {{Plumage characteristics and return rate of one-year-old tropical Roseate
   Terns}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{58-63}},

Abstract = {{We report an unusually high return rate (16\%) of one-year-old Roseate
   Terns (Sterna dougallii) to their natal colony on Aride Island,
   Seychelles, in 2005. Detailed accounts of these birds are provided in
   terms of timing of arrival, breeding status, and plumage
   characteristics, and compared with those of two other age classes
   (2-year-olds and 3 to 6 year-olds) in the same colony and with temperate
   populations. One-year-old individuals returned on average three weeks
   later than older birds and did not attempt to breed. Their immature
   plumage dress ('portlandica phase') differed from their one-year-old
   temperate counterparts, with most birds showing several characteristics
   of adults in full breeding plumage, such as red bill and red legs, long
   tail-streamers, and absence of a dark carpal bar. Contrary to
   expectations from temperate studies, nonbreeding two-year-old
   individuals did not retain any characteristic of the portlandica
   plumage, and were virtually inseparable from breeding adults. The ad hoc
   return rate of Roseate Tern one-year-olds found in this particular year
   is high compared to recapture/resighting data from colonies in temperate
   areas, but is comparable to observations made at other tropical
   (Caribbean) breeding colonies. Altogether, these findings suggest that
   tropical Roseate Terns are prone to return to their natal site earlier
   than their temperate counterparts, and show a more rapid acquisition of
   the adult plumage. This may be especially the case in years of good food
   supply conditions, since the 2005 event coincided with the two years
   (20042005) of highest marine productivity recorded in the vicinity of
   Aride Island over the 1997-2005 period.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic variation in the body mass and acoustic parameters of
   territorial `yodels' recorded from male Common Loons (Gavia immer) were
   assessed for individuals breeding on territories across the eastern
   United States. Multivariate analyses incorporating male body mass, body
   size, the acoustic parameters of yodels, and geographic latitude and
   longitude indicated that males inhabiting lakes in northwestern regions
   were smaller and produced higher-frequency yodels. These relationships
   strengthen previous observations of clinal geographic variation in loon
   body size and vocal behavior across North America, but also support the
   hypothesis that the dominant frequencies of yodels are in part
   influenced by male body size. Therefore, the frequencies loons use for
   long-distance communication are apparently influenced, at least in part,
   by those selective forces responsible for shaping optimal body size.}},

Abstract = {{Annual apparent survival rates of the Magnificent Frigatebird (Fregata
   magnificens) were estimated from 1998 to 2003 using a capture-resight
   model with 870 marked adult birds on Isla Isabel, Mexico (21 degrees 51
   ` N, 105 degrees 54 ` W). The most parsimonious model was a time since
   marking model (or two age class model) with constant resighting rate for
   males and females (p(m) and p(f)), constant apparent survival rate for
   males in both age classes (phi(1)(m) and phi(2+)(m)), and time-dependent
   apparent survival rate for females (phi(1)(f) and phi(2+)(f)) in both
   age classes. We found higher resighting rates in males than in females,
   a tendency of higher apparent survival in females than in males in 1999,
   a clear higher apparent survival rates in females than in males in 2000,
   nearest the same apparent survival rates of the two age classes of males
   throughout, and differences in apparent survival between age classes of
   females showing considerable annual variation within age classes. The
   results suggest permanent emigration of females from the breeding
   colony, whereas males showed site fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{From 26 March to 2 August 2003, both the time budget and the diurnal
   rhythm of behavior of breeding Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis)
   were studied at Ruoergai Wetlands National Natural Reserve, Sichuan
   Province, China. The breeding season was divided into three phases:
   Pre-reproduction, Incubation and Chick-rearing periods. Foraging
   behavior was the most prevalent during the breeding season, accounting
   for 45\% of the diurnal time budget, followed by breeding activity
   (28\%), locomotion (10\%), maintenance (9\%), alert (7\%), resting (1\%)
   and ``other behavior{''} including excretion, calling and antagonism
   (0.6\%). During the three breeding phases, there were significant
   differences in the time budget of all behavior types except for
   locomotion and ``other behavior{''}. In terms of frequency of events,
   alert behavior was the highest, occurring 43 times per hour, followed by
   foraging (31), maintenance (17), locomotion (11), breeding activity (5),
   ``other behavior{''} (1) and resting (0.7). During the three breeding

Abstract = {{The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) is a critically endangered
   species. Over 50\% of individuals winter regularly in Chiku Wetland on
   the southwestern coast of Taiwan. This study investigated the stomach
   contents of the Black-faced Spoonbills killed by avian botulism between
   December 2002 and January 2003 to identify diet of this species at the
   wintering site. Fourteen fish species belonging to eight families and
   one species of prawn were retrieved from 43 stomachs. The Shannon-Weiner
   index for the diet was 1.90. Estimated mean total dry weight of contents
   per stomach containing animal items was 23.3 g (0.1-111.7 g).
   Dogtooth-toxic Goby (Yongeichthys caninus) was the most abundant diet
   species comprising 39\% of the total diet items but contributed only 2\%
   of the estimated total dry weight. Large-scale Mullet (Liza
   macrolepsis), comprising only 17\% of the total diet items but
   contributed 54\% of the estimated total dry weight, was the most
   important diet species. Our results suggest that conservation of the
   Large-scale Mullet is important to this endangered wader.}},

Abstract = {{We examined sexual dimorphism of Dovekie (Alle alle) from the breeding
   colony in Hornsund (south Spitsbergen). Each bird was sexed using DNA
   extracted from blood. Body morphometrics including flattened wing,
   head-bill, tarsus length, bill width and body mass were recorded in 331
   birds caught during the breeding season in 2003-2006. Analysis of
   measurements of mated pairs showed that males are usually bigger than
   females in case of head-bill length, bill width and body mass. Only
   head-bill length was significantly correlated within a pair (r(69) =
   0.354, P < 0.005). A forward stepwise discriminant function analysis
   (DFA) was used to evaluate sexual size dimorphism in Dovekie. The first
   function, applied to 4 measurements, identified head-bill length and
   bill width as the best measurements for sexing and correctly classified
   70\% of our sample (but only 38\% better than chance). The second
   function, which was applied to only 3 parameters (excluding bill width),
   identified head-bill length as the best measurement for sexing and
   correctly classified 65\% of our sample (30\% better than chance). In
   Dovekie, a species having a high degree of overlap between the sexes,
   discriminant function should be used with caution. It is recommended
   that a combination of morphometrics, behavior observation and genetic
   analysis be used to obtain the highest accuracy in sexing individuals
   correctly.}},

Abstract = {{The Imperial Shag (Phalacrocorax atriceps) is monomorphic in plumage,
   but males are larger than females. We analyzed the sexual size
   dimorphism and variability of six morphometric characteristics (bill
   length, bill depth, head length, tarsus length, wing length, and body
   mass) measured on 291 breeding Imperial Shags at Punta Leon colony in
   coastal Patagonia, Argentina, during 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons.
   Discriminant analyses were performed on external measurements that we
   considered potentially useful in sexing Imperial Shags. All the birds
   were sexed by a distinctive behavior (vocalizations) and a sub sample of
   fifty were also sexed by DNA-based genetic techniques, showing 100\%
   agreement between the two methods. All measured characteristics differed
   between the sexes, with males being larger than females. Body mass
   (17.8-18.0\%) and bill depth (12.8-13.2\%) showed the highest level of
   dimorphism whereas bill, head, tarsus, and wing length were less
   dimorphic (ranging 4.8-6.0\%). Dimorphism in body mass for breeding
   shags was lower than previously reported during winter, prior to the
   breeding season. Although the wing length showed the lowest degree of
   dimorphism (5.3-5.4\%), it presented the lowest coefficient of variation
   (1.9-2.0\%) resulting in the most accurate single-measurement indicating
   sex. A cross validation process with a new sample, revealed that
   discriminant functions comprised by two characteristics were more
   accurate and reliable for sex determination than single-measurements. We
   obtained two functions correctly classifying 94-97\% of shags. These
   functions were reliable (similar accuracy for discriminant analysis,
   jackknifed validation, and cross-validation with a new sample) and
   seasonal unbiased, as body mass was not included in the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Diet of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was studied in three
   coastal wintering areas (Axios and Evros Deltas, Messolonghi Lagoon) of
   Greece, in order to assess spatial differences and commercial value of
   prey. Thirteen birds were collected from the Axios Delta, 28 from the
   Evros Delta, and 16 from Messolonghi Lagoon. Pellets were collected from
   the Evros Delta (26) and Messolonghi Lagoon (30). A variety of fish taxa
   were found in the samples, but only one or two dominated in Great
   Cormorant's diet, either by numbers or biomass. Grey mullets (Mugilidae
   and Golden Grey Mullet Liza aurata) were the most important prey by
   numbers and biomass in the Axios Delta; Giebel (Carassius auratus
   gibelio) dominated by numbers and biomass in the Evros Delta; whereas
   Boyer's Sand Smelt (Atherina bo)) was most important by numbers and
   Mugilidae by biomass at Messolonghi Lagoon. Differences found in diet
   between areas are probably due to differences in prey species
   composition and abundance. Fish of high commercial value contributed in
   low proportions in Great Cormorant's diet, by numbers and biomass, being
   highest at Messolonghi Lagoon (22.4\% by numbers, pellets; 11.5\% by
   biomass, stomachs). The small overlap between the bird's diet and
   valuable prey suggests minimal competition with fisheries.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-120}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Techniques most commonly used to estimate migratory shorebird abundance
   often yield estimates with a wide margin of error, and fail to consider
   extent of habitat use. This study was designed to investigate whether
   observation of percentage of a given area covered by shorebird
   footprints may be useful in obtaining accurate estimates of habitat use.
   Flocks of Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) foraging on
   mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, were videotaped and
   percent-cover by footprints was observed upon their departure. Through
   review of the videotapes, habitat use was determined in bird-seconds
   m(-2) (sum of time each individual was present divided by the area
   observed). There was a strong positive, non-linear relationship between
   percent-cover and habitat use, which suggests that the former can be
   used to estimate the latter. A theoretical value for habitat use
   resulting in 100\% footprint cover, beyond which the method would be
   ineffective, was calculated. Observed values did not approach this upper
   limit, and in other related studies 100\% cover has rarely been noted,
   suggesting that this technique is appropriate for use in the Bay of
   Fundy and in other similar settings.}},

Abstract = {{We determined diurnal time-activity budgets of Mute Swans (Cygnus olor)
   at Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA with the principal aim of determining
   intensity of their feeding activity. Although Mute Swan herbivory is
   believed to contribute to declines in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)
   in the Bay, there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative data
   indicating the magnitude of feeding activity by Mute Swans. We collected
   time-activity budgets from May through August 2003 (N = 50 10-minute
   observation periods) and from March through August 2004 (N = 818). Mute
   Swans spent more time feeding (38.4\%) than in non-foraging activities,
   including swimming (21.8\%), resting (18.4\%), self-maintenance
   (18.6\%), agonistic activity (1.7\%), and disturbance-induced activities
   (1.2\%). Feeding intensity was not influenced by seasons (spring and
   summer). Mute Swans foraged more actively during the morning than they
   did midday. Mute Swans in flocks (>= three individuals) spent more time
   feeding than those in pairs and birds in larger flocks spent more time
   feeding than those in smaller flocks. Moreover, a recent exclosure study
   on the Chesapeake Bay indicated that grazing by Mute Swan flocks caused
   a higher SAV decline than grazing by paired Mute Swans. It is likely
   that individuals in flocks (especially large ones) pose a greater risk
   to the SAV in the Bay as compared to those in pairs. Thus, management
   authorities should seriously consider controlling Mute Swan flocks
   (especially large ones) in the Bay in addition to pairs.}},

   contrast with a previous study carried out in the coastal wetlands of

   Nest site selection was strongly influenced by spatial patch structure
   and vegetation structure may act as a cue of habitat quality. Coots bred
   at Timerganine at a high nest density and reproductive performances were
   influenced by adverse weather and more markedly by both predation and
   anthropogenic activities. We also found that alternative reproductive
   strategies were present within the studied coot population which
   exhibited a high rate of conspecific brood parasitism.}},

   large colonies, are known to suffer huge egg losses during storms.
   However, if the devastation of nests is not complete, partial or entire
   clutches can still be saved. The effects of high waves and strong wind
   can be countered to some extent by continuous and accelerated building.
   Even eggs floating in the water inside the remains of destroyed
   platforms may be recuperated by rebuilding the nest around and pushing
   the eggs with the beak ever higher on the weed. Due to the high
   resistance of eggs to cooling, they may even hatch after having passed
   several hours in cold water. In addition, grebes are capable to resume
   or continue laying quickly to replace lost eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were caught on the southern Baltic
   coast during early phase of their autumn migration between 27 July and 9
   August from 1992 to 1995. Due to involvement in breeding, adult
   Black-headed Gull started primary replacement later than second-year
   birds, but their molt was slightly faster during the studied two-week
   period. This suggests that the difference in primary molt score between
   the age classes may decrease toward the end of the molt period. There
   were no differences in primary molt between sexes. Adults had larger
   hole in wing area and they had higher body condition index than
   second-year birds. This might reflect higher cost of flight of adults
   due to their lower aerodynamic efficiency of the wing and their tendency
   to buffer themselves against increased energetic stress. Second-year
   Black-headed Gulls migrate for longer distances farther than adults on
   average and this might be a reason of their slower rate of primary
   replacement.}},

   types: river, lake, delta and dry habitat (lacking water bodies nearby).
   Brood size groups of 1, 2, and 5 nestlings (less common) and 3-4
   nestlings (common) for all years and major habitats were compared. No
   significant spatial or temporal differences in the brood sizes were
   found. The mean brood size of the White Stork in Greece was among the

Abstract = {{Data were collected at one of the important stop-over sites in the
   southern Baltic between 1989 and 1995. Sandwich Terns were not only more
   advanced in primary molt than Common Terns, but also replaced their
   flight feathers faster due to larger number of primaries growing
   simultaneously. All caught adult Sandwich Terns were in active molt,
   whereas over 21\% Common Terns either had not started primary molt or
   suspended it. The difference in migration strategy may be the main
   reason for the discrepancy between these two species in molt
   advancement. Biometrical analysis showed that juveniles of both species
   did not reach adult size at this stage of migration. Sandwich Terns
   caught in late summer in northeast England had shorter wings than birds
   from Puck Bay probably due to different origin of birds caught at these
   two sites. Common Terns caught in Puck Bay were larger than birds from
   German and Scottish breeding colonies and also from birds measured in
   northeast England. Moreover in Puck Bay, 84\% of Common Terns were
   replacing primaries during autumn migration, whereas only 45\% in
   Teesmouth did it at the same time. It seems that Common Terns from west
   Europe and terns passing the Baltic Sea belong to different populations,
   which differ in the distance they cross between breeding and wintering
   grounds and also in biometrics.}},

Abstract = {{Population and trophic relationships among diving ducks in Chesapeake
   Bay are diverse and complex as they include five species of bay ducks
   (Aythya spp.), nine species of seaducks (Tribe Mergini), and the Ruddy
   Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). Here we considered the relationships between
   population changes and diet over the past half century to assess the
   importance of prey changes to wintering waterfowl in the Bay. Food
   habits of 643 diving ducks collected from Chesapeake Bay during
   1999-2006 were determined by analyses of their gullet (esophagus and
   proventriculus) and gizzard contents and compared to historical data
   (1885-1979) of 1,541 diving ducks. Aerial waterfowl surveys, in general,
   suggest that six species of seaducks were more commonly located in the
   meso- to polyhaline areas of the Bay, whereas five species of bay ducks
   and Ruddy Ducks were in the oligo- to mesohaline areas. Seaducks fed on
   a molluscan diet of Hooked Mussel (Ischadium recurvum), Amethyst Gemclam
   (Gemma gemma), and Dwarf Surfclam (Mulinia lateralis). Bay ducks and
   Ruddy Ducks fed more on Baltic Macoma (Macoma balthica), the adventive
   Atlantic Rangia (Rangia cuneata), and submerged aquatic vegetation
   (SAV). Mergansers were found over the widest salinity range in the Bay,
   probably because of their piscivorous diet. Each diving duck species
   appears to fill a unique foraging niche, although there is much overlap
   of selected prey. When current food habits are compared to historic
   data, only the Canvasback (Aythya valisineria) has had major diet
   changes, although SAV now accounts for less food volume for all diving
   duck species, except the Redhead (Aythya americana). Understanding the
   trophic-habitat relationships of diving ducks in coastal wintering areas
   will give managers a better understanding of the ecological effects of
   future environmental changes. Intensive restoration efforts on SAV and
   oyster beds should greatly benefit diving duck populations.}},

   that breed in the Chesapeake Bay including Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos),
   Wood Duck (Aix sponsa), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), Canada
   Goose (Branta canadensis), and Mute Swan (Cynus olor). Long-term (40
   years) and short-term (13 years) trends in breeding populations were
   evaluated using the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Atlantic
   Flyway Breeding Waterfowl Survey. Species that have adapted to
   landscape-level and local habitat changes in the past 40 years have
   expanded, especially Mute Swans, Canada Geese, and Mallards, while
   species that are less tolerant of these changes Such as American Black
   Ducks have declined. Wood Ducks may be showing some recent declines in
   the Bay region, even though the Atlantic Flyway population is
   increasing. Losses of forested wetland habitat: around the Bay may
   account for some of this decline.}},

Abstract = {{The Chesapeake Bay plays a significant role in the life cycle of Bald
   Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) along the entire Atlantic coast of the
   U.S. In addition to supporting a resident breeding population, the
   Chesapeake Bay is an area of convergence for post-nesting and subadult
   Bald Eagles from breeding populations in the southeastern and
   northeastern U.S. The convergence of three geographically distinct
   populations (northeast, southeast, and Chesapeake Bay) suggests that the
   Bay plays a particularly important role in the recovery of Bald Eagles
   ill eastern North America. Since the ban oil DDT and formal listing
   under the Endangered Species Act, the Chesapeake Bay breeding Population
   has increased dramatically. Between the early 1970s and 2001 the
   population within the Bay and vicinity has grown exponentially from 60
   to 646 pairs with all average doubling time of just over eight years.
   Reproductive rates have increased over this time period and are now
   similar to those documented prior to the DDT era. With the current rate
   of increase, the population is expected to reach saturation within the
   next decade. Bald Eagles continue to be vulnerable to the potential
   introduction of new biocides into the estuary, human disturbance within
   nesting and foraging areas, and the loss of habitat to urban and
   industrial development. The tidal fresh reaches of the estuary appear to
   support core breeding areas, as well as, concentration areas for migrant
   poulations and Should be priorities for long-term conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The Chesapeake Bay supports the largest Osprey (Pandion haliaetus)
   breeding population in the world. The population experienced a dramatic
   reduction due to biocide-induced reproductive suppression in the post
   World War 11 era and reached an estimated low of 1,450 pairs by the
   early 1970s. By the mid 1990s, the population recovered to an estimated
   3,500 pairs and breeding was documented on 427 of 878 named tributaries
   of the tidal Bay. Recovery has been exponential but spatially variable
   with average doubling times for defined geographic areas varying by more
   than an order of magnitude. Rates Of Population growth have been
   negatively related to salinity with the highest rates occurring within
   tidal fresh reaches suggesting that recovery has progressed from the
   main stem of the Bay toward the fall line. Virtually nothing is known
   about the breeding ecology of Ospreys in the lower saline waters of the
   Bay. The increase and diversification of man-made structures used for
   nesting has made a fundamental contribution to recovery and current
   distribution. A synthesis of information from several field sites
   throughout the Bay shows a collective increase in reproductive rate
   (young/active pair) from less than 0.8 in the 1960s to more than 1.2 by
   the mid-1980s followed by a reduction to below 1.0 in the late 1980s.
   Threats to the population continue to be the release of new classes of
   contaminants into the estuary and anthropogenic activities that have the
   potential to suppress reproductive rates and juvenile/adult
   survivorship.}},

Abstract = {{With the DDT ban enacted in the early 1970s, piscivorous bird
   populations have grown exponentially throughout the tidal reach of the
   Chesapeake Bay. However, avian population growth is not uniform
   throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed; several species including Bald
   Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Ospreys (Pandion haliaelus)
   experienced significantly greater population growth rates in riverine
   tidal freshwater and oligohaline regions than in higher salinity
   portions of the bay. Shifting fish prey resources may provide an
   explanation for the observed influence of salinity on distribution of
   piscivorous bird populations. Changes in the fish resources available to
   avian predators over the past 40 years include changing temporal and
   spatial distribution of fish prey, as well as shifts in taxonomic and
   trophic structure of resident and migratory fish assemblages. Historical
   ecological changes, including long- and short-term changes in the
   abundance of anadromous clupeid fishes, Atlantic Menhaden (Brevoortia
   lyrannus), and the relatively recent introduction and establishment of
   non-indigenous fishes, within tidal freshwater rivers may be influencing
   piscivorous bird distributions and abundance, particularly for Bald
   Eagles and Ospreys, in the Chesapeake Bay. Predator-prey interactions
   among piscivorous birds and fish prey have received little attention
   from wildlife managers. Collaborative efforts between fishery scientists
   and avian ecologists will ultimately lead to better ecosystem management
   of the Bay's living resources.}},

Abstract = {{A search of the Contaminant Exposure and Effects-Terrestrial Vertebrates
   (CEE-TV) database revealed that 70\% of the 839 Chesapeake Bay records
   deal with avian species. Studies conducted on waterbirds in the past 15
   years indicate that organochlorine contaminants have declined in eggs
   and tissues, although p,p'-DDE, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
   and coplanar PCB congeners may still exert sublethal and reproductive
   effects in some locations. There have been numerous reports of avian
   die-off events related to organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides.
   More contemporary contaminants (e.g., alkylphenols, ethoxylates,
   perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) are detectable
   in bird eggs in the most industrialized portions of the Bay, but
   interpretation of these data is difficult because adverse effect levels
   are incompletely known for birds. Two moderate-sized oil spills resulted
   in the death of several hundred birds, and about 500 smaller spill
   events occur annually in the watershed. With the exception of lead,
   concentrations of cadmium, mercury, and selenium in eggs and tissues
   appear to be below toxic thresholds for waterbirds. Fishing tackle and
   discarded plastics, that can entangle and kill young and adults, are
   prevalent in nests in some Bay tributaries. It is apparent that exposure
   and potential effects of several classes of contaminants (e.g., dioxins,
   dibenzofurans, rodenticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products,
   lead shot, and some metals) have not been systematically examined in the
   past 15 years, highlighting the need for toxicological evaluation of
   birds found dead, and perhaps an avian ecotoxicological monitoring
   program. Although oil spills, spent lead shot, some pesticides, and
   industrial pollutants occasionally harm Chesapeake avifauna,
   contaminants no longer evoke the population level effects that were
   observed in Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) and Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus) through the 1970s.}},

Abstract = {{Colonially nesting wading birds (herons, egrets, and ibis) are a highly
   visible, biologically significant component of the mid-Atlantic coastal
   avifauna. Populations of these species were decimated by extensive
   market hunting in the late nineteenth century, recovered, and additional
   species colonized the region. Herein, we summarize changes in species,
   numbers of breeding pairs, and colony sites for ten species of wading
   birds surveyed four times over a 26-year period (1977 to 2003) within
   the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic coastal barrier island region. Over the
   period of surveys, wading bird breeding colonies increased 246\% (to
   537) and numbers of breeding pairs increased 67\% (to 26,589). Expansion
   among Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias), Great Egrets (Ardea alba),
   Yellow-Crowned Night-Herons (Nyctanassa violacea) and Glossy Ibis
   (Plegadis falcinellus), primarily accounted for the dramatic increase,
   while declines were recorded for Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Cattle
   Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax
   nycticorax). Rapid loss of breeding wading birds along the Atlantic
   coastal lagoon system during the last decade is of particular
   conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past one hundred years, dramatic changes have taken place in
   populations of colonial-nesting seabirds that breed within Chesapeake
   Bay and the Maryland-Virginia coastal region. Populations of species
   that were decimated by extensive market hunting in the late nineteenth
   century recovered, additional species colonized the region and in the
   past ten years many species have declined. During 2003, over 72,000
   pairs of seabirds of thirteen species bred within the region. Breeding
   population sizes are presented and population trends evaluated based on
   benchmark census information from 1977 and regional censuses compiled
   during 1993 and 2003 by the states of Maryland and Virginia. Since the
   1970s, Brown Pelicans (Pelicanus occidentalis) and Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) expanded into the region and now
   represent six percent of the seabird guild. Gull populations have
   exhibited important changes and have affected other seabird species.
   Significant population declines have occurred in Black Skimmers
   (Rynchops niger), Gull-billed Terns (Sterna nilotica), Royal Terns
   (Sterna maxima), and Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). Since 1993,
   populations often of thirteen seabird species have declined, many
   significantly. Conservation challenges for seabird species in the region
   include: 1) habitat change and loss as a result of sea-level rise, 2)
   increasing mammalian predator Populations, 3) competition for colony
   sites, 4) human infrastructure conflicts, and 5) changing fisheries
   populations and harvest. Conserving and managing colonial-nesting
   seabirds in the coming decades as the human population continues to
   increase in the mid-Atlantic region will present significant challenges
   to future generations.}},

Abstract = {{From 1993 to 1999, we conducted banding and telemetry studies of fall
   migrant Soras (Porzana carolina) in the historic rail hunting and
   exceptional stopover habitat of the Wild Rice (Zhania aquatica) marshes
   of the tidal Patuxent River. Drift traps equipped with audio lures
   produced 3,897 Sora and 417 Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) captures
   during the seven-year study. Sora captures were characterized by a high
   proportion (70\% to 90\%) of young-of-the year and a paucity of
   between-year recaptures (N = 12). Radio-telemetry studies depicted Soras
   as long-distance migrants with high stopover survival and a critical
   dependence on tidal freshwater marshes for migratory fattening. Here,
   the high productivity of Wild Rice, Smartweeds (Polygonum spp.) and
   other seed-bearing annual plants seem intrinsically linked to Sora
   migratory fitness. A stopover period of >40 days and mean mass gain of
   +0.6g/d suggests Soras are accumulating large fat reserves for
   long-distance flight. Radio tracking confirmed Soras as strong flyers
   with a demonstrated overnight (ten h) flight range of 700-900+ km. Given
   the potential size of fat reserves and the ability to rise tail winds,
   it is conceivable for Soras to make nonstop flights from the Patuxent
   River to Florida, the Bahamas, or even the Caribbean. Once a widely
   hunted species, a single sport-hunting recovery from Our 3,900 bandings;
   attests to the decline in popularity of the Sora as a game bird in the
   Atlantic Flyway. We Suggest the few between-year recaptures observed in
   our bandings results from three possible factors: 1) the strong
   influence of wind drift on migration, 2) different migration chronology
   or flight path of AHY versus HY birds, and/or 3) high mortality of
   especially HY birds during Atlantic coastal and Gulf crossings. The
   critical dependence of Soras and other seed-dependent, fall-migrant
   waterbirds on highly productive yet limited tidal freshwater marsh
   habitats make conservation of such areas a priority mission within the
   Chesapeake Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent tidal marshes are a dominant feature of the Chesapeake Bay's
   estuarine environment and account for an approximate 123,100 ha of the
   185,870 ha (66\%) of classified wetlands. Tidal marshes vary in
   salinity, structure, and plant composition according to their geographic
   position in the Bay. Chesapeake Bay marshes support breeding bird
   populations that are of regional or national conservation significance.
   Marsh bird communities vary with marsh type, geographic position,
   salinity, patch size, and landscape context. Marsh loss has been
   significant over the past two hundred years primarily as a result of
   urban, industrial, and agricultural development. Protective legislation
   enacted in the 1970s has slowed the rate of loss but marshes continue to
   be degraded and population of marsh birds continue to decline from the
   invasion of exotic species, ground predators, poor management practices,
   encroachment by development, and sea-level rise. Despite these concerns,
   there is still relatively little information on the population trends of
   most marsh birds or on the distribution of some of the Bay's highest
   species of concern such as Black Rails (Laterallus jamaicensis), King
   Rails (Rallus elegans), Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrows (Ammospiza
   caudacuta), and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). Marshes along
   the bay's fringe, tributaries, and islands that currently support
   species at risk of extinction in the Bay are in immediate need of
   identification and protection. High marshes on the Delmarva peninsula,
   support greatest concentrations of species at risk and are marshes among
   the most at risk of loss and degradation. Management to reduce or abate
   threats to marsh birds is critical to their long term survival.}},

Abstract = {{From 1986-2005, Virginia supported between 6\% and 13\% of the federally
   threatened Atlantic Coast Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) breeding
   population with an annual average of 111 nesting pairs (SD +/- 25.0,
   range = 84-192 pairs). The statewide population remained relatively
   static from 1986-2003 ((x) over bar = 104.4 pairs, SD +/- 12.0, range =
   84-127 pairs). In 2004, the population increased to 152 pairs and in the
   following year grew to 192 pairs. Over 95\% of the state's Piping Plover
   breeding activity occurred on the barrier islands. From 1986-1997, five
   pairs or less were observed at Craney Island, a dredge material
   deposition site in Portsmouth and at Grandview Nature Preserve, a
   high-use recreation area located in the City of Hampton. Predators and
   human disturbance likely account for the present-day absence of nesting
   pairs from both inland sites. From 1990-2002, annual productivity
   studies revealed an annual average of 1.14 fledged young per pair (SD
   +/- 0.4, range = 0.59-1.65). The 2003 breeding season marked the first
   time Piping Plover productivity approached two fledged young per pair,
   which was followed by another increase in 2004 when productivity rose to
   over two fledged young per pair. The virtual doubling of Virginia's
   breeding population observed in 2005 along with the recent increase in
   breeding success represents an important contribution to the overall
   security of the Atlantic Coast Piping Plover population. We attribute
   the vitality of Virginia's Piping Plover population to the combined
   effects of predator management, public education and outreach, and the
   unique conservation status of the barrier islands that affords plovers a
   level of protection not found elsewhere within the Atlantic coast
   breeding range.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation status of the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus
   palliatus palliatus) along the Chesapeake Bay, coastal bays, and barrier
   island shorelines of Maryland and Virginia has been investigated in
   detail in recent years. The region supports approximately 700 breeding
   pairs with more than 80\% occurring on the east coast of the Delmarva
   Peninsula and less than 20\% occurring along the shorelines of the
   Chesapeake Bay. The number of breeding pairs in Maryland appears to have
   been stable or to have increased slightly during the past 20 years. The
   overall trend of the breeding population in Virginia is less clear, but
   recent evidence suggests that numbers on the barrier islands are
   increasing after more than two decades of a declining trend. The coastal
   bays and barrier islands typically support between 1,500 and 2,000
   wintering birds with most occurring on the cast coast of the Virginia
   portion of the Delmarva Peninsula. The shorelines of both states
   together play an important role in supporting core breeding and
   wintering populations of the American Oystercatcher in the eastern
   United States. Throughout the region, oystercatchers are facing threats
   common to all coastal waterbird and shorebird species such as predation
   and overwash events. The threat of habitat loss to development, however,
   is not as alarming as in other areas of the species's breeding range due
   to a significant amount of habitat being in protective conservation
   ownership or being unfit for development and recreation purposes.
   Habitat loss attributed to sea level rise, barrier island dynamics, and
   the indirect effects of development, such as pollution and contaminants,
   may play more important roles in the stability of breeding and wintering
   habitat for the American Oystercatcher in Maryland and Virginia.}},

Abstract = {{In the past half century, many waterbird populations in Chesapeake Bay
   have declined or shifted ranges, indicating major ecological changes
   have occurred. While many studies have focused on the problems
   associated with environmental degradation such as the losses of coastal
   wetlands and Submerged vegetation, a number of restoration efforts have
   been launched in the past few decades to reverse the ``sea of
   despair.{''} Most pertinent to waterbirds, restoration of submerged
   aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, tidal wetland restoration, oyster reef
   restoration, and island creation/restoration have benefited a number of
   species. State and federal agencies and non-government agencies have
   formed partnerships to spawn many projects ranging in size from less
   than 0.5 ha to ca. 1,000 ha. While most SAV, wetland, and oyster reef
   projects have struggled to different degrees over the past ten to twenty
   years with inconsistent methods, irregular monitoring, and unknown
   reasons for failures, recent improvements in techniques and application
   of adaptive management have been made. The large dredge-material island
   projects at Hart-Miller Island near Baltimore, Poplar Island west of
   Tilghman Island, Maryland, and Craney Island in Portsmouth, Virginia
   have provided large outdoor ``laboratories{''} for wildlife, fishery,
   and wetland habitat creation. All three have proven to be important for
   nesting waterbirds and migrant shorebirds and waterfowl; however nesting
   populations at all three islands have been compromised to different
   degrees by predators. Restoration success for waterbirds and other
   natural resources depends on: (1) establishing realistic, quantifiable
   objectives and performance criteria, (2) continued monitoring and
   management (e.g., predator control), (3) targeted research to determine
   causality, and (4) careful evaluation under an adaptive management
   regime.}},

   Program is doing to try to reverse these trends. Human population
   growth, increasing separation of people from nature, sea-level rise, and
   the science-public information gap are four of the root causes
   identified; some proactive measures are Suggested for improvements in
   each of these areas. Scientists need to become more proactive and

Abstract = {{The junk-food hypothesis attributes declines in productivity of marine
   birds and mammals to changes in the species of prey they consume and
   corresponding differences in nutritional quality of those prey. To test
   this hypothesis nestling Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) and
   Tufted Puffins (Fratprcula cirrhata) were raised in captivity under
   controlled conditions to determine whether the type and quality of fish
   consumed by Young seabirds constrains their growth and development. Some
   nestlings were fed rations of Capelin (Mallotus villosus), Her ring
   (Clupea pallasi) or Sand Lance (Ammodyles hexapterus) and their growth
   was compared with nestlings raised on equal biomass rations of Walleye
   Pollock (Theragra chalcograma). Nestlings fed rations of herring, sand
   lance, or capelin experienced higher growth increments than nestlings
   fed pollock. The energy density of forage fish fed to nestlings had a
   marked effect on growth increments and could be expected to have an
   effect on pre- and post-fledging survival of nestlings in the wild.
   These results provide empirical support for the junk-food hypothesis.

Abstract = {{Sexual selection can operate throughout the annual cycle and likely
   shapes the winter plumage and courtship displays of many northern
   waterfowl that choose mates during winter. Less conspicuous effects of
   sexual selection are likely and in this study I asked whether winter
   distribution patterns and grouping behavior of Harlequin Ducks
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) are partially shaped by sexual selection.
   Harlequin Ducks are typically dispersed in small groups and observed
   grouping behavior supported the hypothesis that unpaired adult and
   immature birds will show sexually-selected changes in their spacing to
   facilitate courtship and mate sampling. Unpaired birds occurred in
   larger groups than paired birds during October-February, and
   group-relalated differences in the sex ratio and in the proportion of
   females that were unpaired indicated that unpaired birds were
   aggregating g specifically for courtship. Behavior similar to lekking
   was observed at one site. Males gathered at this site at daybreak,
   unpaired females visited the site each apparently to attract a group of
   courting males, and these courting groups left the site without feeding.
   When herring spawn was available in March, unpaired birds were more
   likely to move to exploit it and gained both direct nutritional benefits
   as well as indirect benefits related to changes in time budgets and
   spacing behavior that facilitated courtship and mate sampling. Overall,
   results suggest that sexually-selected behaviors that affect the process
   of mate choice and the timing of pairing are important to consider if we
   are trying to explain winter spacing patterns of waterfowl.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting habitats and nest success of five species of marsh birds were
   studied during 1997 and 1998 at the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge
   (NWR) and the adjacent Oak Orchard and Tonawanda State Wildlife
   Management Areas (WMA) located in western New York. Nest searches
   located 18 American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), 117 Least Bittern
   (Ixobrychus exilis), 189 Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), 23
   Sora (Porzana carolina), and 72 Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) nests.
   Average nest densities in 1998, our best nest searching year, ranged
   from 0.01/ha for Soras (N = 8) to 0.28/ha for Pied-billed Grebes (N =
   160). Mayfield nest success estimates for Least Bittern were 80\% (N =
   16) in 1997 and 46\% (N = 37) in 1998. Nest success estimates were 72\%
   (N = 55) for Pied-billed Grebe, 43\% (N = 6) for Sera, and 38\% (N = 20)
   for Virginia Rail. Nests of all five species were located in >= 70\%
   emergent vegetation with a mean water depth of 24-56 cm and an average
   vegetation height that ranged from 69-133 cm. Logistic regression models
   were developed for each species rising habitat variables at nest and
   random site locations. Each model was ranked with Akaike's Information
   Criterion for small sample size (AIC(c)). In general, our best models
   indicated that increased emergent vegetation and horizontal cover with
   shallow water depths improved the odds of encountering marsh bird nests
   in the wetlands of western New York. We suggest that managing wetlands
   as a complex, at different stages of succession, would best benefit
   marsh bird species.}},

Title = {{The St. Lawrence River Estuary and Gulf: A stronghold for Barrow's

Abstract = {{From 1997 to 2005, the distribution, seasonal abundance, and age and sex
   ratios of wintering Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) was
   documented in the St. Lawrence River Estuary and Gulf, Canada, with a
   combination of ground and helicopter surveys. Ground surveys showed that
   Baie-Comeau and Baie-des-Rochers were the most important localities,
   with monthly averages of 250 (max. = 1020) and 273 (604) individuals,
   respectively, from November through April. Helicopter surveys showed
   that four areas (Baie-Comeati, Baie-des-Rochers, Baie-Sainte-Catherine
   and La Malbaie/Cap-a-l'Aigle) harboured on average 74\% of all Barrow's
   Goldeneyes in the estuary, that numbers of individuals were more stable
   at these sites, and that the distribution of Common Goldeneyes
   (Bucephala clangula) within the estuary differed from that of Barrow's
   Goldeneyes. Because of ice conditions, goldeneyes were not found on the
   south shore of the estuary during the coldest winter months, although
   they were quite numerous in spring and fall. In contrast, large numbers
   of goldeneyes used the north shore of the estuary all winter long and
   through the end of April. In January-February of 1999, 2002 and 2005,
   helicopter surveys (N = 8) yielded on average 2428 Barrow's Goldeneyes
   (CV = 8\%), 2503 Common Goldeneyes (6\%) and 1320 Red-breasted
   Mergansers (Mergus serrator, 70\%) per year in the estuary. These
   species averaged 2087 (CV = 81\%), 2214 (41\%) and 2898 (34\%)
   individuals/year, respectively, in the gulf in January-February of 2002
   and 2005 (N = 3). Helicopter survey results indicated possible
   identification errors between these three species, stressing the need to
   survey them concurrently. The January-February ratio of adult males and
   `brown heads' was greater in 1998 (57.0\%) that) it) 1999 (51.8\%),
   partly because there were more immatures in the population in 1999 (18.1
   \%) than in 1998 (10.2\%). Adult sex ratios were significantly different
   from 1/1 in January-February of 1998 (P < 0.0001) and 1999 (P = 0.0072),
   whereas immature sex ratios were not (P >= 0.27). The monthly proportion
   of immatures increased between January and May of 1998 (P < 0.0001) and
   1999 (P < 0.0001), because of adults departing for breeding areas. The
   eastern North American wintering population of Barrow's Goldeneyes may
   include a maximum of 6187 individuals, of which > 90\% would winter
   along the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf. Thus, the St. Lawrence corridor
   should undoubtedly be considered as the winter stronghold for Barrow's
   Goldeneyes in eastern North America.}},

Abstract = {{Many bird species use human-made habitats and an important issue is
   whether these are equally suitable foraging habitats as are historical,
   natural habitats. Historically, Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens
   caerulescens; hereafter Snow Geese) wintered in coastal marshes in
   Louisiana but began using rice-prairies within the last 60 years. Time
   spent feeding was used as an indicator of habitat suitability and time
   and energy budgets of Snow Geese were compared between rice-prairies and
   coastal marshes in southwest Louisiana. Composite diets of Snow Geese
   have a lower energy density in the rice-prairies than in coastal
   marshes; thus, we predicted that Snow Geese would spend relatively more
   time feeding in rice-praires to obtain existence energy. However, time
   spent feeding was higher in coastal marshes and thus, not proportional
   to energy density of composite diets. Snow Geese in coastal marshes
   ingested less apparent metabolizable energy than did Snow Geese in
   rice-prairies. In rice-prairies, juveniles spent more time feeding than
   did adults; however, time spent feeding was similar between age classes
   in coastal marshes. Undeveloped foraging skills probably cause juvenile
   Snow Geese to forage less efficiently in coastal marshes than in
   rice-prairies. These findings are consistent with recent trends in Snow
   Goose numbers, which increased in rice-prairies but remained stable in
   coastal marshes.}},

Abstract = {{From May 2000 to November 2003 we studied waterbird use of mangroves,
   intertidal flats, shrimp ponds and coastal forests surrounding Leizhou
   Peninsula at the southernmost extent of mainland China. We recorded 61
   waterbird species. The most species-rich habitat was intertidal flat
   with 45 species, followed by mangrove with 38 species, shrimp ponds with
   37 species and coastal forest with 15 species. Greatest bird abundance
   was on intertidal flats, which supported 69\% of all birds recorded and
   81\% of all migrants. Leizhou Peninsula is in the East
   Asian-Australasian flyway of migratory birds and is an important staging
   site for migrants. Intertidal flats proved important to nationally and
   provincially protected and threatened species. Species richness and
   abundance at shrimp ponds nearly equaled that in mangroves. Charadriids,
   scolopacids and ardeids used shrimp pond dikes as roosts and foraging
   habitats during high tides. Shrimp pond dikes play an important role by
   substituting for natural high-tide roosts such as sandbars, which, in
   many cases, they replaced. Mangrove-planting programs should avoid
   conversion of important intertidal flats. When restoring abandoned
   shrimp ponds, it is also important to retain some dikes as high-tide
   roosts and foraging areas. Because of the complexity of coastal-zone
   land administration on Leizhou Peninsula, it is critical that government
   departments work together to plan and implement mangrove restoration and
   intertidal flat conservation projects.}},

Abstract = {{One of the proposed benefits of colonial nesting in birds is the
   protection afforded against avian predators. This advantage may be
   counter-balanced by the negative effects of intraspecific aggression on
   breeding success. Effects of nest density, nest location within the
   colony, and timing of nest initiation on productivity of Caspian Terns
   (Sterna caspia) were investigated on Crescent Island in the mid-Columbia
   River, Washington, USA. In the absence of intense nest predation at the
   Crescent Island tern colony, it was hypothesized that nest density would
   be negatively associated with productivity. A rangefinder was used to
   determine spatial distribution of Caspian Tern nests, and these data
   used to calculate nest characteristics (nest density, nearest neighbor
   distance, and distance to colony edge) for a randomly-selected subset of
   nests monitored for nest chronology and productivity. Productivity did
   not differ between nests in high- and low-density areas of the colony,
   and was positively associated with earlier nest initiation. Early nests
   were more productive, were located in areas of higher nest density, and
   were further from the colony edge than late nests. The strong effect of
   timing may have been attributable to seasonal declines in prey resources
   for terns at this site. Our results suggest that Caspian Terns nesting
   at the highest densities observed in this study did not incur immediate
   reproductive costs, despite increased potential for encounters between
   chicks and aggressive conspecific adults.}},

   played in this decline has remained uncertain. During summer 2003, VHF
   rachotelemetry and rafting locations were used to determine whether
   birds foraged primarily in bass habitat. The foraging activities of ten
   breeding cormorants were monitored by radiotelemetry from both land and
   water on a daily basis, weather permitting, throughout the breeding
   season. In addition, cormorant foraging raft locations were documented
   by boat survey throughout the breeding season. Rachotelemetry indicated
   that cormorants typically foraged 2.5 km away from their colonies, at
   the northeastern end of Beaver Island. This area overlaps with the area
   determined from rafting locations; however the latter were centered
   further south. These data allow for better estimation of foraging patch
   use by archipelago cormorants and indicate that birds are not typically
   concentrating their foraging in Smallmouth Bass habitat. Cormorants
   forage in open water in areas with dramatic changes in depth, and these
   locations agree with diet data that indicates that Alewife (Alosa
   pseudoharengus) are important prey. Data gathered has led to a better
   understanding of cormorant foraging patterns in the study area, and
   indicate that if cormorant foraging areas remain spatially separate from
   bass habitat, the probability of birds directly impacting these fish is
   low.}},

Abstract = {{Although chicks of water birds usually stay in their nesting territory,
   in a few species they precociously leave the nesting site and join
   together in a ``creche{''}. While several authors have suggested a
   relationship between creching behavior and reduced aggression in Larids,
   quantitative data on aggression in creching species are missing. In this
   paper, we quantity the level of aggression through the breeding season
   in two evolutionarily independent species pairs, each consisting of two
   closely-related creching and non-creching species (Black-billed Gull, L.
   bulleri,creching; Red-billed Gull, L. scopulinus, non-creching; versus
   Slender-billed Gull, L. genei, creching; and Black-headed Gull, L.
   ridibundus, non-creching). Aggressiveness was similar among species
   until the chicks were 1-2 weeks old and then decreased in creching
   species and increased in non-creching ones. This change in
   aggressiveness at an age when chicks usually join a creche strongly
   suggests it is related to creching behavior. To broaden our study we
   suggest a comparative approach including Tern species.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) occurs in the vast majority of birds,
   although explanations for its existence are controversial. We studied
   SSD in the Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), a large wading bird,
   by recording copulating birds on a video camera and obtaining
   measurements of tibia, tarsus, bill, body length and body depth, on each
   individual in a pair. Field studies were conducted in the natural
   heronries of the Delhi Zoo in North India. For quantifying the
   dimensions of various body parts we improvised upon a microscopic
   software (MOTIC IMAGES) and developed a protocol for obtaining the
   dimensions of body parts in metric units. Males were larger than the
   females in all of the 100 pairs recorded during the study period. A PCA
   performed on the available data set of male and female independently
   showed a significant difference in the first PC scores, which were
   highly correlated with body length in both sexes. A tendency towards
   positive assortative mating was observed by plotting the male and female
   values of different variables. There were no significant differences in
   the median body lengths of individuals recorded copulating early and
   late in the nesting season. However, early male birds were recorded to
   have significantly larger tarsus, compared to later birds. The
   methodology used in this field study has wide applicability for studying
   the SSD and mating patterns in various groups of waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{As raptor Populations recover following the banning of organochlorine
   pesticide use, there may be consequences for prey populations. While
   Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) actively prey on Glaucous-winged
   Gulls and their offspring (Larus glaucescens), their presence at
   colonies and roost sites may also influence reproductive success of
   gulls by impacting activity budgets. Here we investigate changes in Bald
   Eagle abundance in relation to gull breeding phenology over 6 years at
   Seabird Rocks (Vancouver Island, Canada) and compare activity budgets Of
   gulls in relation to Bald Eagle abundance. Bald Eagle abundance varied
   seasonally, peaking during late incubation and hatching of gull eggs. As
   Bald Eagle presence increased, gulls showed a strong increase in time
   allocated to vigilance (54\%) and frequency of flushing (up to 6
   times/hr). These results indicate that Bald Eagle attendance patterns at
   gull colonies coincide with hatching of gull chicks and can influence
   time-activity budgets of gulls. Predator-induced changes in gull
   behavior during the breeding season may influence reproductive success
   by impacting time and energy budgets and facilitating egg and chick
   predation. These findings could be important for understanding failure
   at gull colonies in Barkley Sound and evaluating impacts of increasing
   Bald Eagle populations in the region.}},

   Tern (Sterna antillarum) nesting colonies often occur on flat or gently
   sloped gravel rooftops throughout the Southeastern United States.
   Currently, these rooftops are being converted to a new substrate,
   unsuitable for Least Tern nesting, because of changes in state building
   codes. The purpose of this study was to determine which rooftops Least
   Terns are currently selecting to help develop man-made structures for
   nesting and determine where these structures should be placed. From
   1998-2003 in Pinellas County, Florida, all previously occupied Least
   Tern rooftops were surveyed to see if they had a colony and new colonies
   were located. In 2003, there were 36 rooftops with colonies and 34
   unoccupied rooftops that had been previously occupied sometime from
   1998-2002 but still had gravel rooftops. In addition, 36 gravel rooftops
   that had no record of supporting a Least Tern colony were randomly
   selected. At each building distance to any body of water, distance to a
   large body of water, distance to a higher building, distance to another
   colony, height of building, area of rooftop, number of taller
   trees/poles within 50 m and number of trees that touched the roof were
   measured. Backwards stepwise regression indicated that only distance to
   water significantly predicted if a rooftop was currently or never
   occupied. These results indicate that even relatively small, low
   structures, located near any body of water may be judged suitable by
   Least Terns and have the potential to help add to the species' overall
   productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent interest in the interactions between birds and feather
   microbes, little is known about the identity of these microbes, and all
   studies of feather microbes thus far have focused on passerines living
   in temperate regions. Comparisons of the microbial groups living on
   different groups of birds may provide valuable insight into the
   ecological roles microbes play on feathers. We used culture-independent
   molecular techniques to identify the assemblages of bacteria found on
   the feathers of two closely related seabirds (Crested and Least Auklets
   (Aethia cristatella and A. pusilla)) and, for comparison, domestic
   Chickens (Gallus gallus). Some isolates were found on all three species
   (as well as on other species, as reported in the literature), while
   others were only found on Auklets. In particular, bacteria of the cold-
   and salt-tolerant genus Psychrobacter were only recovered from Crested
   Auklets. These results suggest that some genera of bacteria may be
   commonly found on birds, while others may be restricted in their
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Forster's Terns (Stemajarsteri), like most seabirds, are monomorphic and
   are difficult to sex without extensive behavioral observations or
   genetic sexing. We conducted the first morphological study and
   discriminant function analysis on Forster's Terns to develop a method to
   accurately identify their sex in the field. A sample of 84 terns from
   the San Francisco Bay estuary were captured or collected, measured, and
   the sex of 40 female and 44 male terns was confirmed by genetic analyses
   or via necropsy. Male Forster's Terns were larger than females for 7 of
   9 morphological measurements, with head-bill length showing the least
   amount of overlap between the sexes, followed by culmen length and
   culmen depth at the gonys. Sexual size dimorphism was greatest with
   retrix R-6 length, followed by culmen width, and culmen depth. A
   discriminant function including only head-bilt length accurately sexed
   82\% of Forster's Terns, whereas a second discriminant function
   incorporating both head-bill length and culmen depth at the gonys
   increased sexing accuracy to 87\%. When we used a 75\% posterior
   probability or greater of accurately sexing Forster's Terns, we excluded
   only 18\% of the sample that overlapped and accurately sexed 94\% of the
   remaining individuals. Our results indicate that Forster's Terns can be
   accurately sexed in the field using only 2 morphological measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) type A of the subtype H5N1 has
   recently spread widely and rapidly across Eurasia, and even to Africa,
   with deaths of both wild and domestic birds recorded. There are fears
   that it may soon spread to the Americas. Media accounts, communications
   from international bodies and national governments, and even some of the
   professional research literature attributes the spread, in part, to
   movements of HP strains by migratory birds. The origin of highly
   pathogenic strains is attributed to mutations, or to reassortment of
   virus genes from different host species. In this paper we review these
   hypotheses in light of knowledge about the ecology and evolution of
   avian influenza, looked at from the viewpoint of its natural reservoir -
   waterbirds. Our purpose here is to alert waterbird biologists that they
   have much to contribute to the science of this globally-important issue.
   New technologies have revealed that the genome of avian influenza
   contains much variation beyond that recognizable by classical antibody
   techniques, and have established avian influenza as a rapidly evolving
   and diversifying lineage. The extensive genetic variability in the viral
   genome and extensive reassortment within host species Suggests that high
   pathogenicity could repeatedly and independently evolve from low
   pathogenic ancestors under appropriate selection pressures, such as
   those in poultry production systems. This makes infection of wild birds
   by HPAI lineages evolved in poultry a more likely occurrence than the
   reverse. The available evidence largely fits this model. We make
   recommendations that will help reduce the incursion of
   domestically-evolved avian influenza strains into wild populations of
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the influence of stream geomorphology and habitat quality
   on brood weight, offspring growth rate, and territory length of Belted
   Kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon) in northwestern Vermont, USA. We gathered
   measurements of habitat use, fish abundance and biomass, and
   reproductive success at breeding territories in stream reaches of
   differing geomorphic and habitat conditions during spring and early
   summer 2002. We used model selection based on AIC, to examine the
   effects of stream geomorphology, habitat quality, and fish abundance and
   biomass on the selected reproductive measures. Geomorphic condition
   emerged as the most important predictor variable for models of both
   brood weight and territory length. We tested two viable models during
   the 2003 breeding season at new, independent breeding territories and
   found them to be well-supported. Our results provide evidence that
   stream geomorphic condition plays both direct and indirect roles in the
   habitat use and reproduction of Belted Kingfishers, suggesting that
   stream and riparian management strategies focused on protecting and
   restoring functional morphology will have ecological benefits for
   riverine birds.}},

Abstract = {{The Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica) has until recently received
   little conservation and management attention within North America
   despite a relatively low overall population size and significant
   declines in parts of the breeding range. This lack of attention may
   stein in part from the wide distribution of the species, encompassing
   parts of six continents, and from its tendency to nest in relatively
   small, scattered and often ephemeral colonies. Populations of North
   American subspecies are alarmingly small. The current population of the
   eastern subspecies aranea in the U.S. is unlikely to exceed 3,600 pairs,
   with over 60\% of these birds occurring in Texas. The Texas Population
   has remained generally stable, but declines of populations in Maryland
   (where probably extirpated), Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, and
   possibly Georgia give cause for concern for this subspecies. For the
   western subspecies vanrossemi, as few as 250 pairs nest at only two
   locations in the U.S., both in California. When Populations in western
   Mexico are considered, the entire vanrossemi population numbers only
   600-800 pairs. Currently the Gull-billed Tern is listed as
   ``endangered{''} or ``threatened{''} in four states, and is considered
   to be of management concern in five others. The breeding range of the
   species has contracted and shifted slightly from its known historic
   range in the middle Atlantic states, but otherwise occupies its historic
   range in the United States and has expanded slightly to coastal southern
   California. Some range contraction in Mexico (e.g., in Sonora) may have
   occurred. In eastern Mexico, historical information is almost
   non-existent and knowledge of current distribution and abundance is
   incomplete. Main threats to populations in North America include loss of
   natural nesting islands through beach erosion or perturbations to
   estuarine functions, development or modification of upland habitats near
   breeding areas that may be important for foraging, and disturbances to
   colonies by humans and feral or human-subsidized predators. This species
   often nests on man-made substrates suggesting it could be responsive to
   management of breeding sites. Key research needs include more frequent
   and refined population monitoring, a better understanding of
   demographics, metapopulation dynamics and factors limiting populations
   as well as refinement of subspecies' breeding distributions and
   wintering ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) were observed and/or netted on the
   coast of Bahia, Brazil in January and/or February from 1996 through 2003
   as well as in November 2005. The breasts of almost all netted Roseate
   Terns examined were washed with pink. Analysis of breast feathers taken
   from birds during the breeding season indicates the pink color is
   carotenoid-based, with astaxanthin as a major component. Pigment
   concentration was low, measured in micrograms of carotenoids per gram of
   feather (maximum recorded 6.2 mu g of carotenoids g(-1) of feathers),
   compared to milligram quantities in overtly red feathers in other
   species, and varied markedly among individuals. A pink blush apparently
   characterizes the plumage of the Roseate Tern for most of the year,
   often being more prominent in January/February during the non-breeding
   season than in breeding birds in May.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic coast population of the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus
   palliates) has seen mixed success in its recovery from historic lows at
   the turn of the 20th century. During the mid-1980s, breeding numbers in
   Maryland were estimated at 50-75 pairs based on incidental observations
   and the results of the state's first breeding bird atlas project. With
   growing national and regional concern for the species and a need for
   current information on its status in Maryland, the state's first
   comprehensive survey of nesting oystercatchers was conducted during the
   2003 breeding season. Both hatching success and fledging success were
   relatively high, with some breeding birds nesting in areas where they
   were not previously found in the state. Most oystercatchers nested on
   salt marsh islands, as opposed to the extensive barrier island found
   along Maryland's coast. Although a similar number of birds nested in the
   Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays, nest success was significantly greater
   in the Chesapeake Bay. Landscape type proved to be the only variable
   that was significantly associated with statewide nest success, though it
   did not explain the differences in success between Chesapeake Bay and
   Coastal Bay birds. Several existing and potential threats require
   consideration in future studies and management of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is listed as a species
   of high priority by the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan and is
   state-listed as rare in Georgia; however, biologists have not focused on
   identifying the causes of egg and hatchling losses. In 2003 and 2004,
   continuous video monitoring was used to document reproductive success of
   American Oystercatchers and identify causes of nest failure at
   Cumberland Island National Seashore, Georgia. The modified Mayfield
   method and program CONTRAST were used to determine and compare survival
   of eggs and nestlings. Eleven pairs made 32 nest attempts during two
   seasons. Nine attempts were successful, fledging 15 chicks. Daily
   survival of clutches was 0.973 (95\% CI = 0.960-0.987) for 2003, 0.985
   (95\% CI = 0.974-0.995) for 2004, and 0.979 (95\% CI = 0.970-0.987) for
   combined years. Daily survival was greater on the North End, than on the
   South End of the island (X-1(2) = 7.211, P = 0.007). Eighteen of 20 nest
   failures during the egg stage and one of eight chick losses were
   documented. Egg predators included raccoon (Procyon lotor, N = 9),
   bobcat (Lynx rujas, N = 3), and American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos, N
   = 1). A ghost crab (Ocypode quadata) preyed on one chick. Other causes
   of nest failure were tidal over-wash (N = 1), horse trampling (N = 1),
   abandonment (N = 2), and human destruction (N = 1). The North End of the
   island has one of the highest reproductive rates reported along the
   Atlantic coast. Predator control may be an effective means of increasing
   reproductive success on the South End of the island.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study of begging in Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea)
   found that chicks convey information about their body condition through
   the number and rate of begging calls Littered during a feeding session.
   Parents delivered larger meals when chicks begged more intensely. Here
   we test whether acoustic properties of begging calls of Cory's
   Shearwaters are related to body condition of chicks, and whether parents
   are responsive to changes in acoustic parameters. Acoustic parameters,
   which were analyzed using semi-automatic call contour analysis, included
   the duration of calls and silent intervals, the minimum, mean and
   maximum frequency in a call and the number of frequency peaks within a
   call. We found that, in contrast to the number and rate of begging
   calls, acoustic parameters did not reflect chick body condition, and
   were not correlated with the meal size delivered by the attending
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{The literature indicates that predation of seabirds by ciconiiform birds
   is limited to terns and is generally of little impact. We monitored
   predation of the eggs and chicks of Cape Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   capensis) by Sacred Ibises (Threskiornis aethiopicus), and Gray Herons
   (Ardea cinerea) for 46 days over three breeding seasons at Penguin
   Island, Lambert's Bay, South Africa. The ibises were observed to take at
   least 152 cormorant eggs and chicks and 37 heron chicks. Extrapolation
   of the results to the full season of availability indicates that these
   ciconiiform predators may take as many as 960 cormorant eggs or chicks
   in a season. If so, they would be the third most serious cause of
   mortality among the 4,800 pairs of Cape Cormorants at Penguin Island.
   The observed combined effect of ciconiiform predation was greater than
   that of the local, predatory, Khoisan Gulls (Larus (dominicanus)
   vetula). We document the seasonality and diel timing of predation,
   behavior of the predators, and the cormorants' responses. To place our
   observations in context we review the global literature concerning the
   incidence of ciconiiform predation upon seabirds, which we consider to
   be under-reported, and factors affecting it. Finally we consider the
   effects of ciconiiform predation on seabirds at Penguin Island relative
   to a broader, five-year, study of the causes of seabird mortality there,
   and make recommendations for conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), Andean
   Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus
   jamesi) in single-species and mixed-species flocks were studied at
   Laguna de Pozuelos, Argentina, by comparing the foraging pattern of each
   species in the presence and absence of the others. Spatial segregation
   among species within a flock was found. James Flamingo used the edge and
   the shallow foraging depth both in single-species and mixed-species
   flocks. Chilean Flamingo did not use the edge or the shallow depth
   either in single-species or mixed-species flocks, and used moderate and
   deep foraging depths. Andean Flamingo exhibited the most flexible
   foraging pattern, grouping either with Chilean Flamingo or with James
   Flamingo depending on which of these species predominated in the flock.
   Spatial difference in the feeding behavior among the three flamingo
   species may be principally attributed to the habitat of prey organisms.
   Chilean Flamingo feeds on planktonic organisms present mainly in the
   upper portion of the water column, and therefore this species can access
   a wider range of food items if foraging at deeper depths both in
   single-species or mixed-species flocks. The foraging pattern of James.
   Flamingo was indicated by its main prey, benthic and aerophilic diatoms,
   largely found in shallow waters near the edge of the lake. Andean
   Flamingo feed on benthic diatoms common in the water-sediment interface
   of shallow and deep waters, thus favoring its grouping behavior with
   james or Chilean Flamingos in mixed-species flocks.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the diet of Black Skimmers (Rhynchops niger) through analysis
   of pellets and faeces collected at Pates Lagoon estuary, southern
   Brazil, where non-breeding birds gather from December to August. We
   identified 23 prey types from twelve families of fishes, two of
   crustaceans, and one of squid (N = 1797 prey items). Silversides
   (Odonthestes argentinensis and Atherinella brasiliensis), anchovies
   (mainly Lycengraulis grossidens and Engraulis anchoita), and Mullets
   (Mugilspp.) Were the main components of the diet, representing 83\% of
   number and 81\% of mass of prey. Prey size ranged 9.7-212.1 mm total
   length and 0.01-78.1 g, with mean at 51.6 mm and 2.81 g. Considering
   frequency of occurrence and the relative contribution in number and
   mass, the Argentinean Silverside (O. argentinensis) was the most
   important prey in three seasons of the year. Anchovies represented 41\%
   of ingested mass in summer. Small-sized mullets represented 30\% of prey
   number; but showed low mass contribution (maximum of 13\% in winter).
   Sciaenids were only important in autumn (18\% of ingested mass).
   Otoliths were found in 53\% of pellets and 55\% of faeces samples,
   suggesting that the relative contribution of smaller-sized prey to the
   diet was underestimated. Composition of diet and size distribution of
   prey suggest that Black Skimmers fed mainly in the lower estuary, but
   also on the adjacent ocean beach.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive performance of a large Great Blue Heron (Ardea
   herodias) colony was documented and the potential effects of weather on
   reproductive performance was investigated. Annual surveys were conducted
   during the last week of May or the first week of June between 1992 and
   2004 and were designed to count all fledglings and nests in and around
   the heronry. Mean number of fledglings per nesting attempt during the
   13-year interval was 1.57 +/- 0.22 fledglings (range: 1.14 to 1.87).
   Mean number of fledglings per successful nest during the study was 1.80
   + 0.18 fledglings (range: 1.44 to 2.06). The number of fledglings per
   nesting attempt was similar to other long-term studies for the species,
   but the productivity based on fledglings per successful nest was
   typically lower. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that both
   fledglings per nesting attempt (active nest) and fledglings per
   successful nest were significantly influenced by weather patterns
   (number of days with greater than 0.30 inches of rain and average
   monthly wind speed) during the month of May prior to fledgling.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of avifauna was documented in Magdalena Bay,
   the largest coastal wetland on the Pacific coast of the Baja California
   peninsula. An inventory of waterbirds in the three wetland zones of
   Magdalena Bay-Almejas, Baja California Sur was conducted by boat.
   Composition, abundance, and distribution of species were determined in
   12 coastal censuses conducted from February 2002 to February 2003. A
   total of 207,383 individuals of 80 species and 20 families were
   recorded. Seven listed species breed in the wetland. Only ten out of 80
   species were very common, while the others were occasional along the
   coastline. Guilds with highest populations were pelicans and allies
   (54\%), followed by shorebirds (23\%), and gulls, terns and skimmers
   (14\%). The highest richness of 63 species was recorded in the Santo
   Domingo Channel in autumn. In contrast, the highest abundance (50,082)
   was recorded in fall in Magdalena Bay. Migratory birds explained spatial
   and temporal changes in richness, while resident pelicans and allies
   explain abundance variations. The highest species richness was observed
   in mangrove zones, particularly in the Santo Domingo Channel. Therefore,
   this habitat together with breeding and gathering places used for other
   activities, should be primary targets for future management and
   conservation initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes provide a wide variety of avian habitats that
   vary seasonally. The effects of seasonal habitat changes on the habits
   of four large waterbird species in an agriculture-wetland mosaic are
   investigated in this paper. The habits of Painted Storks (Mycteria
   leucocephala), Asian Openbills (Anastomus oscitans), Woolly-necked
   Storks (Ciconia episcopus) and Black-headed This (Threskiornis
   melanocephalus) were documented over a 15-month period in Etawah and
   Mainpuri districts, Uttar Pradesh, India. Monthly road transects were
   undertaken to determine flock sizes, density, and habitat preference of
   these species. Flock sizes varied significantly with season for
   Woolly-necked Storks and Black-headed Ibis and with habitat for Painted
   Storks. Flock size and density were strongly correlated in all four
   species. Increasing wetland size and extent of wetlands in the landscape
   affected flock size of Asian Openbills implying that food availability
   may be the most important factor affecting flocking in this species.
   Density differed seasonally for Woolly-necked Storks and Black-headed
   Ibis. Density of all four species did not vary with extent of wetlands
   in the landscape. Monthly densities of Black-headed Ibis were correlated
   to that of all the other three species. Habitat use varied widely across
   species and seasons. Natural wetlands but not rice fields were preferred
   by all four species in nearly all seasons. Irrigation canals were
   avoided consistently by the Black headed Ibis and used to different
   extents by the other three species. Flooded agriculture fields did not
   compensate adequately for natural wetlands. Wetlands need to be retained
   in agricultural landscapes to ensure continued survival of these
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The Relict Gull (Larus relictus) is considered vulnerable due to its
   declining world population. Non-breeding season ecology of this species
   is poorly understood. Recent observations on wintering Relict Gulls
   indicated that Bohai Bay, Tianjin municipality, China, is important for
   this species. From 2003-2005, surveys were carried out there in order to
   provide data on distributions, numbers and population structure of the
   gulls during the non-breeding season. The results show that Bohai Bay is
   of international importance for Relict Gulls based on the 1\% Ramsar
   criterion. The maximum wintering flock was composed of 3,362
   individuals, which is nearly one third of the world population.
   Proportions of the three age groups (first-year, second-year and adult)
   changed through the migration season. Loss of intertidal flats and human
   disturbance are regarded as the main threats to the gulls. Further
   surveys on population size, distribution and age structure should be
   conducted along the coasts of southern Bohai Bay and the Yellow Sea
   during the winter in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{The coast of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina, includes a remarkable
   diversity of habitats and is used by more than fifteen Nearctic
   shorebird species during the austral summer months. We evaluated
   non-breeding shorebird distribution and abundance patterns along the
   Buenos Aires coastal zone and determined shorebird use of different
   coastal landscapes. Surveys were conducted in December 2000, and January
   and February 2001, using line-transect methods. The data were classified
   based on five previously defined coastal landscapes. Fifty four
   localities were surveyed covering 93 kilometers of coastline. A total of
   44 waterbird species corresponding to 13 families were recorded.
   Shorebirds (Scolopacidae, Charadriidae, Haematopodidae and
   Recurvirostridae) accounted for approximately 45\% of recorded
   waterbirds, including 14 nearctic species. Shorebird species recorded
   per locality varied from one to eleven, with 61\% of the localities
   having one to four species. The most common were the American
   Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris
   fuscicollis), Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus), American
   Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica) and the Sanderling (Calidris alba).
   Shorebird species richness and abundance varied significantly among
   coastal landscapes, with the highest values recorded in estuarine
   saltmarshes of Bahia Samborombon and Bahia Blanca. Among marine
   landscapes, the highest abundance and number of species were recorded in
   sandy beaches with ``restinga{''} patches. This study confirms that
   shorebirds are an important component of the birdlife in the Buenos
   Aires coastal zone during the austral summer months, and that their
   distribution is not homogeneous along the coast, with species richness
   and abundances varying among localities depending on coastal landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific exploitation competition as a cause for density dependent
   breeding success in White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) was investigated.
   Breeding success of 101-126 pairs of White Storks was documented between
   1999 and 2004 over an area of 1026 km(2) and which included suboptimal
   foraging conditions. Pairs were classified in density groups according
   to the number of neighboring breeding pairs within their home range
   (i.e., within a radius of 1.5 km from the nest). The surface of
   potential feeding habitats was used as a food resource indicator and
   analyzed for all nests within the home range and compared among density
   groups. Breeding success was density dependent. Pairs breeding alone and
   pairs with one neighbor within the home range most frequently reared
   three chicks, pairs with two neighbors reared two, but pairs with three
   or four neighbors most frequently failed to raise a single chick.
   Regarding the use of organism-weighted densities expressed as the number
   of conspecific neighbors breeding within a pairs' home range and
   foraging biology of the species, intraspecific exploitation competition
   was a possible cause for density dependent breeding success.}},

Abstract = {{Royal Tern (Sterna maxima) chick diet at Fisherman Island National
   Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, was investigated in 2003 and 2004. Primary
   objectives were to document common prey species, annual and seasonal
   variation in prey selection, and seasonal variation in prey size based
   on average bill length in this species. Over 2200 Royal Terns bred on
   this island each year of the study. Single items of prey species carried
   in the bill by adult terns feeding their chicks were identified using 8
   x 42 binoculars. A total of 11,566 and 33,646 prey items were identified
   during 44 and 87.5 h of systematic observations in 2003 and 2004,
   respectively. Terns foraged largely on anchovy (Anchoa spp.) early in
   the season, then switched to herrings (Clupeidae); average prey size
   also increased seasonally each year. Prey switching was similar to that
   of Royal Terns in North Carolina (but with drum as well as herring),
   indicating regional adaptations to forage fish availability by this
   species along the mid-Atlantic seaboard.}},

Abstract = {{We used satellite transmitters (platform transmitting terminals or PTTs)
   during 2002 and 2003 to document spring migration timing, routes,
   stopover sites, and nesting sites of adult female Northern Pintails
   (Anas acuta) from major wintering areas of the Gulf Coast (N = 20) and
   Playa Lakes Regions (PLR, N = 20) in Texas, and the Middle Rio Grande
   Valley, New Mexico (MRGV, N = 15). Some Pintails tagged in the MRGV
   continued movements into Mexico. Poor winter survival or PTT failure
   reduced sample size to 15 for PLR Pintails, 5 for Gulf Coast Pintails,
   and I I for MRGV Pintails. Apparent winter survival was 66\% lower for
   Texas Gulf Coast PTT-tagged Pintails than for those from the PLR and
   MRGV. Pintails from each area used different routes to their respective
   breeding grounds. PTT-tagged Pintails from the MRGV followed the Rio
   Grande Valley north to southern Colorado, before traveling on to the
   Dakotas and Canada or traveled northeast and joined the migration of PLR
   Pintails in Texas or Kansas. The latter made initial stops in Kansas,
   Nebraska, Colorado, or the Dakotas. Gulf Coast Pintails traveled through
   north-central Oklahoma or central Kansas. Pintails that had stopped
   first in Kansas or Nebraska tended to settle to nest in the United
   States. Wetland availability in the Prairie Pothole Region of the
   Northern Great Plains influenced nesting destinations of PTT-tagged
   Pintails, but individuals settled across a wide swath of northern North
   America. We did not detect any consistently-used spring staging areas.
   Therefore, negative impacts to any. of the marked populations, or their
   wetland habitats, may have continental implications.}},

Abstract = {{Assignment and quantification of breeding production areas of migratory
   birds is a crucial step in understanding their population dynamics and
   informing conservation and management decisions, especially for game
   birds. Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis) breed throughout the North
   American boreal, taiga, and non-forested regions of the Arctic and
   Siberia. Birds harvested in North America originate from these remote
   northern regions but conventional mark-recapture techniques cannot
   readily be used to answer key questions of proportionate take due to the
   logistical impossibility of marking young birds in an unbiased way. We
   used stable-hydrogen isotope analyses (delta D) of feathers from 242
   hatch-year (HY) and 628 after-hatch year (AHY) cranes harvested during
   the 2002 and 2003 hunting seasons in Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Kansas,
   Oklahoma, and Texas in order to provide new quantitative information
   regarding their geographical origins. While adult cranes originated from
   throughout the breeding range, south of the tree line, most birds were
   produced in the southeast boreal of western Ontario and/or central
   Manitoba and/or western Alaska. Adult birds taken in Saskatchewan, at
   the northern portion of the collection area, showed more northwesterly
   origins than birds taken at the southernmost extreme in Texas. Isotopic
   analysis of claws and feathers from individuals showed good correlation
   suggesting that claws could also be used to delineate latitude of
   origin, especially for AM birds that may retain some flight feathers for
   more than one year. Future Studies need to consider more carefully the
   potential contributions of southern boreal populations and if possible
   to develop means to distinguish isotopically those birds originating in
   western Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Fidelity of King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) to breeding and wing
   molt sites was examined using satellite telemetry data obtained
   opportunistically when battery life of transmitters provided locations
   in a second year. Consecutive breeding locations were obtained for
   eleven female and 23 male King Eiders. All females exhibited breeding
   site fidelity by returning to sites within 15 km of first year breeding
   areas on the North Slope of Alaska. Breeding locations of males in a
   subsequent year were located on average > 1000 km from their prior
   breeding sites and were primarily outside Alaska, on the coasts of
   Russia and Canada. Second-year wing molt locations were obtained for two
   female and six male King Eiders. Wing molt sites of males were located
   6.2 +/- 3.1 km apart on average in successive years, while female wing
   molt locations averaged almost 50 km apart. Our results demonstrate site
   fidelity of female King Eiders to a breeding area on the North Slope of
   Alaska, document the dispersal of male King Eiders between breeding
   seasons, and present the first evidence for wing molt site fidelity in
   males.}},

Abstract = {{In the Camargue of southern France, declining nest success of the Little
   Egret (Egretta garzetta) in mixed colonies over the past three decades
   has been suggested to be, at least partially, explained by exclusion
   from high-quality nest sites by the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis). The
   Cattle Egret has been rapidly increasing over the same time period and
   are well known to be aggressive at the nest. Previous studies have also
   shown that the success of the Little Egret is highest in the centers of
   colonies. The behavioral interactions and spatial patterns of nest
   establishment were studied within colonies of the two species. Our data
   suggest that the Cattle Egret was more successful at displacing the
   Little Egret at nest sites than the reverse. Three indicators of
   nest-site quality (i.e., laying date, nest density and position within
   the colony) were also used to test whether the proportion of Little
   Egret nests within different sections of a given colony was less than
   that of Cattle Egret nests at higher quality sites. Our results
   indicated that the proportion of Little Egret nests at a given site
   decreased with increasing site quality. Thus, the data are consistent
   with the hypothesis that the Cattle Egret may exclude the Little Egret
   from using high-quality nest sites at least in some colonies during some
   years.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Apparent survival of adult Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) occupying
   two distinct breeding habitats within the East Bay Migratory Bird
   Sanctuary, on Southampton Island, Nunavut was estimated. The first group
   occurred on a small island where 30 pairs bred at relatively high
   densities sympatrically with Common Eider (Somateria mollissima), on
   whose eggs they feed. The larger group occurred at lower densities on a
   wet coastal plain on the surrounding Southampton Island mainland, where
   nesting birds were sparsely distributed. Program Mark was used to
   analyze capture-mark-resight (CMR) data obtained over six years from 62
   adults captured between 1998 and 2002; 47 and 15 nesting on the island
   and mainland respectively. Factors in models included group and time
   effects on survival and reduced time effects on encounter probabilities;
   additional factors and interactions were not tested due to sparse data.
   High model selection uncertainty and wide 95\% confidence intervals
   around model effect sizes precluded ability to draw inferences
   concerning the importance of group and time factors in survival. Given
   these results, focus was placed mainly on an estimate of annual survival
   (0.87 +/- 0.03 SE) from the time- and group-independent model. This is
   the only known survival estimate produced for Herring Gull adults at the
   northern limit of their North American breeding range and falls within
   the wide range of values reported elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the Common Loon (Gavia immer) during its breeding season on
   northern freshwater lakes in North America have suggested that water
   quality has an influence on breeding and foraging success. Less is
   known, however, about the effects of water quality on loon behavior
   during the winter, which is spent in estuarine and marine environments.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of water clarity and tidal
   stage on loon diving behavior at seven sites along a Maryland estuary.
   At each site, the total number of loons observed and mean dive durations
   of individuals were measured and compared to various measurements of
   water clarity, including Secchi depth and turbidity, and to tidal stage.
   Dive durations were positively associated with Secchi depth, which
   indicates that birds dove for longer periods in areas with higher water
   clarity. Dives were also longer during low tide in comparison to other
   tidal stages. No relationship was found between aspects of water clarity
   and the distribution of wintering loons.}},

Abstract = {{DNA sequence variation from two nuclear introns and part of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene were used to evaluate population
   structure among three subspecies of Least Tern that nest in the United
   States (California {[}Sterna antillarum browni], Interior {[}S. a.
   athalassos], Eastern {[}S. a. antillarum]). Sequence variation was
   highest for nuclear intron XI (Gadp) within the
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. The second nuclear intron
   was fixed for the same allele in all subspecies. Fixation indices, F-ST
   and M-ST for Gadp indicated genetic divergence between California and
   Interior subspecies. Estimates of nuclear gene flow were < 4
   individuals/generation, except between the Interior and Eastern
   subspecies (4 individuals/generation). Genetic indices for mitochondrial
   DNA did not differ among subspecies, and gene flows (reflecting female
   dispersal) ranged from 10 to 83 individuals/generation. Reservations are
   expressed about the validity of the current subspecific divisions and
   further research is required, including their taxonomic relationship to
   the Little Tern (Sterna albifrons).}},

Abstract = {{The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) is a critically endangered
   species. Over 50\% of individuals winter regularly in Chiku Wetland on
   the southwestern coast of Taiwan. This study investigated the stomach
   contents of the Black-faced Spoonbills killed by avian botulism between
   December 2002 and January 2003 to identify diet of this species at the
   wintering site. Fourteen fish species belonging to eight families and
   one species of prawn were retrieved from 43 stomachs. The Shannon-Weiner
   index for the diet was 1.90. Estimated mean total dry weight of contents
   per stomach containing animal items was 23.3 g (0.1-111.7 g).
   Dogtooth-toxic Goby (Yongeichthys caninus) was the most abundant diet
   species comprising 39\% of the total diet items but contributed only 2\%
   of the estimated total dry weight. Large-scale Mullet (Liza macrolepis),
   comprising only 17\% of the total diet items but contributed 54\% of the
   estimated total dry weight, was the most important diet species. Our
   results suggest that conservation of the Large-scale Mullet in the
   habitats is important to this endangered wader.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal composition and sexual differences in the diet of the
   White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) were investigated in Buenos Aires
   Province, Argentina. A total of 88 stomach contents were analyzed, from
   White-faced Ibis feeding on riparian pastures and grasslands in the
   Magdalena district, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Samples were
   obtained between 1992 and 1996, covering each season of the year. The
   trophic spectrum was determined based on the identification of 59 items,
   mainly belonging to animal taxa. Diet was composed of Insecta (43
   items), Arachnida (3 items), Crustacea (5 items), Gastropoda (3 items),
   Hirudinea (3 items), Amphibia (1 item) and vegetable (1 item). Dietary
   composition was analyzed in terms of number, frequency of occurrence and
   volume, for each season and between sexes. Significant differences
   between sexes were found in the volume of the ingestion consumed.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted an observer-based diet study of Caspian Terns (Sterna
   caspia) incorporating digiscoping to collect digital photographic
   vouchers of fish. Observer-based diet studies pose several problems,
   ranging from differential experience and abilities of observers to the
   lack of vouchers for confirming identification. One solution to these
   problems is to recover fish either directly from birds (i.e., trapping,
   shooting) or ones dropped on the colony. This may not, however, be
   desirable or achieve adequate sample sizes. Some species are difficult
   to capture or methods may cause significant disturbance and/or nest
   abandonment. To overcome these problems, we used a relatively
   inexpensive new photographic technique known as digiscoping. By holding
   a high-resolution point-and-shoot digital camera up to the eyepiece of a
   spotting scope or pair of binoculars, we could take digital photographic
   vouchers of fish as terns brought them into the colony. During the
   study, we made 16,423 observations, identifying 92\% of the fish to the
   family (3\%), genus (15\%), or species (74\%) level. We supported these
   observations with over 2,500 digital photograph vouchers. Vouchers
   confirmed identification of all fish taxa and allowed for later
   identification, by us or qualified fisheries biologists, of several
   species unidentifiable in the field. The ability to have independent
   experts confirm observations and identify previously unidentifiable
   observations greatly expanded our understanding of the range of fish
   taken by Caspian Terns.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{203-210}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Estimating the size of breeding populations of colonial nesting wading
   birds is a priority for waterbird management but locating colonies can
   be difficult. Existing methodologies to locate wading bird colonies
   require use of airplanes and/or a systematic search of likely colony
   locations on the landscape. This study describes the rise of vanishing
   bearings of Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) as they depart coastal
   foraging sites to determine the number and location of associated
   breeding colonies. In 2002, frequency analysis of the vanishing bearings
   identified 23 modes at ten sites while in 2003, 29 modes at 15 sites
   were identified. Of these modes, about one-half (twelve in 2002 and 15
   in 2003) were associated with a known colony. Groupings of vanishing
   bearings Unassociated with known colonies prompted searches for unknown
   colonies. Searches in 2002 and 2003 found three colonies missed during
   routine colony inventories using information from the public. Intensive
   searches in 2004 and 2005 at foraging sites where large colonies had
   previously abandoned located four previously unknown colonies. These
   results give confidence that all colonies associated with known foraging
   sites can be located using this method.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental procedure was set up to test if Carrion Crow (Corvus
   corone) predation on Little Tern (Sterna albifrons) eggs could be
   decreased by conditioned taste aversion. The experiment started with a
   control period, during which 30 artificial Little Tern nests were.
   maintained with quail eggs for 6 days at two study sites. The rate of
   egg predation was assessed through daily visits and observations of crow
   behavior. During the treatment period (following 6 days), 15 nests were
   supplied with eggs pre-treated with methiocarb, an ill-inducing
   compound, while the other 15 nests were maintained with non-treated
   eggs. The treatment period was extended by a further period of eight
   days, during which only treated eggs were deployed at 15 nests. Carrion
   Crows did not develop any aversive response to the eggs. All treated and
   untreated eggs were taken by crows from the nests and broken in less
   than 24 h after delivery. However, treated eggs were apparently not
   consumed by crows, which suggests that they were able to identify the
   egg content prior to consumption. The lack of success of our study calls
   into question the general applicability and effectiveness of this
   method.}},

   Sahel zone across Africa, its diet during the breeding season has never
   been studied. Chick meals were sampled in stork nests in West and
   Central Niger during early July and late August, representing early and
   mid rainy seasons in the area. The diet consisted of amphibians (Bufo
   sp.) and a range of insects with grasshoppers (Orthoptera) as the
   dominant (23 species) group making up 30\% and 59\% of prey biomass in
   July and August, respectively. In terms of frequency of occurrence, the
   important Sahelian pest species Oedaleus senegalensis was the most
   common grasshopper in the stork chick diet. There was a marked seasonal
   difference in the relative importance of insects and vertebrates: in
   July amphibians made tip 61\% of diet by wet weight, and insects 38\%,
   while in August insects made up 92\% of prey wet weight, and amphibians
   only 6\%. The high dependency on amphibians in July was a surprise, but
   suggests that toads may be the key prey for the adult storks during the
   incubation period when toads become active while major new insect
   generations have not yet emerged. The increased importance of insects
   later in the rainy season reflects the emergence of new generations of
   grasshoppers, where, in particular, the locally (too) abundant Oedaleus
   senegalensis becomes the main prey.}},

Abstract = {{The role of spatial, temporal and weather factors on the foraging
   behavior of migrating Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla L.) was
   explored during fall staging in the upper Bay of Fundy (Canada) over two
   years. Factors that influence foraging benefits during migration
   stopover may influence fitness in a migratory species. The number of
   captures and success rate peaked during the middle of day regardless of
   temperature. Pecking rate decreased with increasing temperature while
   the number of captures and success rate increased suggesting that
   foraging benefits are lower at low temperatures. The number of captures
   and success rate did not change as a function of tide stage or time of
   year despite presumed changes in prey availability and/or density.
   Running and flying activities were also influenced by time of day and
   weather factors. Difficulties in locating prey or detecting predators
   may explain the effect of time of day and increased thermoregulation
   costs and changes in prey activity are probably involved in explaining
   how weather factors influence foraging behavior in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Grey Herons foraged in a high number only in one of three preferred
   foraging areas in the Dobczyce Reservoir, S. Poland: (1) the backwater
   area at the main tributary inlet (MTI), (2) the shore of the near-dam
   pool (NDP), and (3) shallow lateral bay (SLB). Median value of the
   fraction of herons foraging in MTI was 64\% of all counted in the
   reservoir in 2001-2002 despite the smallest fish density there (2 times
   smaller than in NDP, and by one order of magnitude than in SLB). Roach
   (Rutilus rutilus) was the most abundant both in the heron diet (13
   species) and in littoral fish communities (8 species). Total length of
   prey ranged within 4.2-26.5 cm. The individual size range of littoral
   fish was similar (4.6-31.5 cm). However, the size distributions in three
   foraging areas and in heron diet were different. Fish longer than the
   median total length of heron prey, i.e. >= 8 cm in total length
   constituted 51.9\% of heron diet, 34.7\% of the fish community in MTI,
   8.5\% in the psammolittoral of NDP, and only 5.2\% in the phytolittoral
   of SLB. The strategy of selective choice of longer fish from those
   occurring at foraging sites allowed greater reward with roughly
   unchanged foraging cost. This may explain why Grey Heron foraged mainly
   in the habitat with the lowest fish abundance and highest water
   turbidity but with the largest prey size.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic observations of staging dabbling ducks through 24 autumns
   (1978 to 2001) in a Danish wetland show that the numbers of the numerous
   species Eurasian Wigeon (Anas penplope), Eurasian Teal (Anas crecca) and
   Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) were positively and only, correlated and
   with the water level. For the less numerous species, Northern Shoveler
   (Anas clypeata) and Northern Pintail (Anas acuta.), the correlation with
   the water level was less evident, and an effect of the overall size of
   the flyway population was demonstrated. The increasing numbers recorded
   with rising water level may have two explanations or probably a
   combination. One is redistribution of birds migrating through the
   region, reflecting that the available habitat limits the numbers of
   ducks recorded, and the other is prolonged stay for individual birds
   when conditions are favorable. The relationship between average seasonal
   water level and average number of ducks were modelled to estimate a
   minimum favorable water level to he maintained throughout the autumn, a
   tool proposed for optimizing the site for staging dabbling ducks.}},

Title = {{Historic populations of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax
   auritus): Implications for conservation and management in the 21st
   century}},

Abstract = {{In North America, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus)
   is currently abundant, widely distributed across five broad geographic
   regions, and often perceived as overabundant. In many U.S. states and
   Canadian provinces, policy makers are pressured to significantly reduce
   cormorant numbers, primarily to minimize conflicts between cormorants
   and fish resources. Concurrently, large-scale conservation plans
   recently developed for birds in the Americas depart from the traditional
   narrow focus on threatened and endangered species to encompass broader
   and more representative goals (e.g., Partners in Flight's objective to
   ``keep common birds common{''}). In recent waterbird conservation
   initiatives, historic distribution and abundance provide the basis for
   conservation focus; these initiatives advocate conservation of-birds in
   natural numbers and natural habitats. To provide a context in which
   current populations of Double-crested Cormorants can be understood, we
   reviewed historic and current breeding and wintering records to
   determine historic distribution (pre-1900), current distribution
   (1970-1999), and extent of range expansion across North America. Early
   records suggest Double-crested Cormorants were present in large numbers
   throughout much of their current range; colonies and flocks much larger
   than any known in the 1990s are well documented. However, numbers
   sharply declined through the late 1800s as cormorants were greatly
   reduced and/or extirpated in many areas. The population partially
   recovered through at least the mid-1900s, bot experienced a second major
   decline (hiring the 1950s-1970s. In the late 1970s, a second rebound
   began across much of the continent; the largest breeding populations
   (Canadian/U.S. interior, Atlantic Coast < 80\% of total) increased from
   approximately 32,000 pairs in the early 1970s to > 226,000 pairs in the
   late 1990s. Comparison of historic and current records challenges the
   opinion that cormorants are currently overabundant, and suggests that
   perception of overabundance rests oil socio-political rather than
   biological or ecological factors. For this species, and others that are
   seen as competitors with humans, limits of human tolerance (i.e.
   ``social carrying capacity{''}) are far narrower than those of
   biological carrying capacity. Because large numbers have been typical
   for cormorants historically population targets based on fishery or other
   objectives derived from human values will likely be readily surpassed,
   require intensive management, and significantly depart from the concept
   of conserving birds in natural numbers and natural habitats. Although
   managing fish-eating birds to benefit fishery yields may increase some
   fish populations, this approach does not. resolve or address the
   underlying problems causing current fish population declines across the
   continent, and is in direct conflict with current broad scale
   conservation initiatives. To ensure inclusion of cormorants and other
   fish-eating birds in these conservation plans, the avian conservation
   community most continue to press for programs based on ecosystem health
   and process that recognize humans, fish and cormorants as three
   components of a complex system driven by man), species and dynamic
   interactions.}},

   of market hunting, subsistence hunting, and habitat loss. Since then,
   restoration has focused primarily oil reintroduction efforts in which
   captive-reared birds are released and then monitored. From 1991 to 1993,
   44 birds were released into Seney National Wildlife Refuge (Schoolcraft
   County, Michigan) in a multi-agency attempt to enhance the breeding
   population of this species in the Upper Great Lakes region. To provide
   information useful to swan restoration efforts elsewhere, this paper
   summarizes 14 years of Trumpeter Swan occupancy and productivity at
   Seney. In doing so, we document the first substantial inter-annual
   decline in swans on the Refuge and provide evidence that suggests birds
   may now be dispersing onto other lakes and wetlands in the eastern Upper
   Peninsula of Michigan. We also present information from which we infer
   processes regulating swan numbers and rates of productivity and discuss
   both the continued need for monitoring and the need for research to
   examine the effects swans might have on other components of aquatic
   ecosystems at the Refuge.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the movement, distribution and site affinities of
   radio-marked Tule Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons elgasi)
   during spring and Summer in Alaska, 1994-1997 and 2004. Our assessment
   of summer movements was comprehensive, as locations were obtained during
   prenesting, nesting, and molt for over 90\% of geese with active radios
   captured during winter or the previous summer in Alaska. Geese arrived
   to coastal and interior marshes in the Cook Inlet Basin (CIB) from mid
   April to early May, after which they moved to nesting areas in the upper
   CIB. Nesting birds used coastal staging areas in close proximity to
   eventual nest site location. Molting sites included a sub-glacial lake
   system in the upper CIB, although up to 50\% of geese underwent a molt
   migration to wetlands across the Alaska Range, 400-600 km west of the
   CIB. Geese that melted at distant sites returned to the CIB before
   autumn migration. Length of stay in the CIB varied among years from
   108-119 days, and averaged 116 days. Summer home-range sizes, exclusive
   of molting areas, averaged >273,000 ha, and were substantially larger
   than reported for other northern-nesting waterfowl. No radio-marked
   geese were found nesting in the vicinity of Redoubt Bay oil the west
   side of Cook Inlet, and few nested near the Susitna Flats, the only
   other previously known nesting areas. The absence of nesting geese from
   Redoubt Bay corroborates aerial survey data showing a precipitous
   decline in the use of the west side of Cook Inlet between the early
   1980s and early 1990s. The change in distribution of geese is likely
   related to a major eruption of Redoubt Volcano in 1989 that
   significantly altered landscapes used by nesting, brood rearing, and
   molting geese in the vicinity of Redoubt Bay. High inter-site movements
   of Greater White-fronted Geese throughout, summer in South central
   Alaska likely increases exposure to predation, but also promotes social
   interactions and facilitates pioneering of distant, and diverse habitats
   in a vast, patchy, and often unpredictable landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Selvagem Grande holds one of the most important colonies
   of Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) in the Atlantic. Historical
   records suggest a stable population well in excess of 100,000 pairs. A
   succession of massacres in 1975 and 1976 dramatically reduced this
   population to less than 10\% of the original numbers. Since 1977 strict
   protection was enforced and the population started a steady recovery.
   However, between 1995 and 1998 an alarming decline, of more than 13\% of
   the birds, was reported and concurrently the monitoring work was
   interrupted. Data from other colonies in the Atlantic and the
   Mediterranean also indicated significant regional declines, some of
   which appear to be driven by unsustainable levels of accidental
   mortality in fishing gear. In order to investigate the persistence of
   the regressive trend at Selvagem Grande, we carried out a global census
   of the colony in June 2005. We counted 20,555 occupied nests and
   estimated the total breeding Population at 29,540 pairs. The population
   still appears to be recovering from the massacres of 1975-1976, at an
   average rate of about 4.6\% per year over the past 25 years. Our data
   reveal that Selvagem Grande now harbors the largest known Cory's
   Shearwater colony in the World. Results from this study suggest that
   this population is not, as yet, suffering from unsustainable
   fisheries-related mortality, which would be reflected in a decline in
   numbers. This situation contrasts with that of the Mediterranean, where
   significant mortality in fishing gear has been linked to shearwater
   population declines.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the number of nests and colonies of Great Egret
   (Ardea alba), Little Egret. (Egretta garzetta), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus
   ibis), Chinese Pond Heron (Ardeola bacchus) and Black-crowned Night
   Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) in Hong Kong between 1989 and 2004. Little
   Egret, Chinese Pond Heron and Black-crowned Night Heron were the
   dominant local breeding ardeids. Regression analysis of the number of
   nests and colonies with year revealed that the number of nests of Great
   Egret, and the number of colonies of all ardeids, except the
   Black-crowned Night Heron, showed a significant increase. The number of
   nests of Great Egret increased from no nests in 1989 to 85 in 2004. The
   other species fluctuated from 100 to 300 nests each, except for Cattle
   Egret which stayed steady at about 100 nests. Regression analysis of the
   relationship between climate variables and residuals, after removing the
   effect of any long-term trend, shows that there was a significant
   positive association of the number of nests of Cattle Egret with total
   rainfall during breeding. The increase in numbers of colonies, but not
   the number of nests. indicated that previously large colonies had split
   into smaller ones, presumably due to loss of feeding and nestin,
   habitats. The El Nino events in 1991 and 1997, but nor in 1994,
   coincided with declines in nests. The magnitude of El Nino may be
   related to the impact on nesting ardeids, but other local confounding
   variables, in particular feeding habitat availability, should also be
   considered. The number of Great Egret nests in Hong Kong is of
   (r)egional importance, as it is about half the known nests in southern
   China. It is recommended that monitoring of breeding success should be
   initiated in major colonies, as well as air integrated wetland
   monitoring for Deep Bay and Starling Inlet.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of ardeid nesting colonies in Hainan Province, China, was made
   between May and August 2004 and recorded 5,287 nests of four species
   (Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, Chinese Pond
   Heron Ardeola bacchus and Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax
   nycticorax), in 18 colonies in the northern area. Chinese Pond Heron was
   the dominant nesting species (62\% of the total nests), while the
   Black-crowned Night Heron was the least abundant (4\%). Numbers of the
   Chinese Pond Heron in Hainan is probably related to the presence of
   extensive ricefields in this area. Fewer numbers of nests of all species
   in the field were recorded compared with expected obtained from nest
   densities over a ricefield-dominated landscape in a previous study of
   ardeid nest abundance in central China. This suggests that nest density
   in central China could not be applied in Hainan and the assumption of 5
   million nests in China requires further study. Based on available
   information for south China, numbers of nesting Cattle Egret and Chinese
   Pond Heron in Hainan (75\% of total nests of each species),
   Black-crowned Night Heron in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Great Egret in
   Hong Kong (80\%) are of regional importance. Using media to invite
   readers to report nesting colonies is recommended for similar surveys in
   a large area as it provides a cost effective approach to minimize
   sampling effort.}},

Abstract = {{The International Waterbird Census (IWC) is one of the longest-running
   bird monitoring schemes in the Western Palearctic. Most of its data are
   collected with land-based counts, the reliability of which is largely
   unknown. This study compared estimates of land-based vs. aerial counts,
   and the relative conservation values of coastal sites obtained with the
   two methods. The data were collected in the West-Estonian archipelago of
   the Baltic Sea in 1993, and analyzed at two spatial scales (mean area of
   plots 9 and 36 km(2)). Among nine waterfowl species, land-based and
   aerial census provided closely correlated local population estimates for
   the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor), Steller's Eider (Polysticta stelleri),
   Long-tailed Duck (Clangula hyemalis) and, at the larger scale, for the
   Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). However, small numbers of all species,
   except the swan, remained undetected with the land-based census, and
   numbers of Mallard and Steller's Eider were also systematically
   underestimated. The areas having the highest conservation value were
   reliably identified with the land-based census, particularly at the
   larger scale. Hence, land-based studies are in general accordance with
   the aims of the IWC, but the absolute population estimates should be
   interpreted with care.}},

Abstract = {{Two different types of food samples from the Black Skimmer (Rynchops
   niger) were collected during the non-breeding season: spontaneous
   regurgitations and pellets. These two samples were analyzed and differed
   in the number of taxonomic categories represented, the number of fish
   prey species found and in the estimated size of fish prey. However, key
   prey were the same and well represented in both types of samples,
   suggesting that both sources gave accurate information, at least for the
   main items. Given that collecting pellets involves little effort and low
   disturbance to the birds, the value of the analysis of pellets to
   monitor long-term dietary changes in the Black Skimmer and other seabird
   species of similar size and diet is considerable. Correction factors are
   proposed to overcome underestimation of the total length and mass of
   some fish prey species remains found in pellets.}},

Abstract = {{The role of food abundance and vegetation structure in selection of
   foraging habitat by the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) was explored.
   Selection of available foraging patches of either dense or sparse
   habitat structure within two prairie habitat types used extensively by
   foraging kites, Eleocharis flats and Panicum flats were examined.
   Estimated Apple Snail (Pomacea paludosa) densities on our study site
   ranged from 0.33 to 1.58 per m(2). Vegetation structure (sparse vs.
   dense) of the habitat type had a greater influence on where prey was
   captured than did site, the dominant emergent vegetation, or prey
   abundance. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that
   dense vegetation may obscure prey and limit or preclude use of densely
   vegetated habitats by foraging kites. This may be true, even when prey
   is in relatively high abundance, and may indicate the difference between
   prey abundance and availability. Most water management recommendations
   related to the Snail Kite call for prolonged inundation, based on an
   explicit assumption that this results in increased Apple Snail
   abundance. Even when directed at a single species such as the Snail
   Kite, water management may need to be considered in a more holistic
   framework that considers factors that influence the resulting vegetation
   communities, rather than just production of Apple Snails.}},

Abstract = {{Similar to other bird species, Coots (Fulica atra) usually interrupt
   feeding to look tip and to scan their environment for predators.
   Predation risk may differ among feeding methods. Coots may suffer from
   aerial predators both in the water and on land, and additionally from
   terrestrial predators when feeding on land. Samples were obtained from
   10 different study sites where Coots fed both on water and on land
   (N=139 feeding-bouts). Flock structure differed significantly between
   feeding methods, and nearest-neighbor distance was lower on land (water:
   5.2 +/- 0.3 Coot length, land: 2.8 +/- 0.2 Coot length). Mean
   feeding-bout length-defined as the time of uninterrupted feeding-was
   significantly different (water: 12.2 +/- 0.8 s, land: 9.4 +/- 0.8 s).
   When Using the study sites as samples, aquatic feeding-bouts were also
   significantly longer. In a general linear mixed model a significant
   influence of feeding method on feeding-bout length was found, again with
   a higher font length in the water. Feeding-bout lengths were positively
   correlated between aquatic and terrestrial feeding within the same study
   site. These results suggest that Coots perceived more safety during
   aquatic feeding which was reflected in longer feeding-bouts.}},

Abstract = {{Survival of Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) nests was
   compared in areas with and without nesting Arctic Terns (Sterna
   paradisaea) to determine whether the protection provided to plovers by
   association with this colonial species is passive or aggressive.
   Artificial and natural nests placed 5100 m from terns had similar rates
   of survival (< 10\% of all nests lost to predators), and benefited
   substantially from protection against predators through aggressive
   behavior of nesting terns. Natural nests had much higher survival than
   artificial nests when positioned > 100 m from nesting terns, suggesting
   that the presence of incubating adult plovers reduces the probability of
   nest predation. Nesting in association with Arctic Terns may represent
   an alternate form of habitat selection by Semipalmated Plovers and
   suggests that plovers can employ alternate nest defense strategies when
   opportunities are present.}},

Abstract = {{Great Crested Grebes (Podiceps cristatus) wintering on prealpine lakes
   of north Italy are considered to cause economic damage to fish, reducing
   the stock of native Bleak (Alburnus alburnus). We experimentally
   investigated the effectiveness of three deterring actions (gas-cannon,
   crackers and shooting) in four study sites at Lake Como, by comparing
   the time-budget and space-rise of wintering grebes in absence and
   presence of disturbance. All dissuasion methods affected grebe behavior
   and position on the lake, but some resulted more effective than others.
   The gas-cannon detonations had little effect, but, crackers and showing
   caused significant changes in grebe behavior. Grebes spent less time
   feeding, testing and preening, but more time moving/swimming during
   dissuasion than in the control situation. Moreover, birds also moved
   away from the areas with bleak shoals, resulting in a significant
   decrease in grebe numbers with either dissuasion methods. Although
   dissuasion reduced feeding of arches in areas with shoals of Bleak
   (Alburnus alburnus), and probably reduced grebe predation on immature
   fish at localized areas, it involves intensive effort, in terms of
   man-days..}},

Abstract = {{We compared time-budgets and return rates of breeding female Barrow's
   Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) fitted, or not, with transmitters
   attached with backpack harnesses in 2001-2004 in southern Quebec. We
   compared the mean proportion of time devoted to feeding, locomotion,
   alert, resting, preening, and maintenance (i.e., resting Plus preening)
   by females observed >= 200 min. Females with backpacks (N=5) spent
   significantly less time feeding (x SE: 25 +/- 5\% versus 43 +/- 3\%) and
   more time in maintenance activities (51 +/- 6\% versus 31 +/- 4\%) than
   females without transmitters (N=6). Mean time devoted to other behavior
   did not differ significantly. Upon release, females appeared disturbed
   with the backpack, actively bathing, preening and/or flapping wings. Of
   the females with transmitters observed >= 200 min, three spent 4\%, 8\%,
   and 57\% of their preening time at their transmitter, antennae or
   harness. None of the 16 females harnessed in 2001-2003 were recaptured
   in nest boxes or seen again on the study area in 2002-2004. For
   comparison, 66\% of adult female Barrow's Goldeneyes captured in nest.
   boxes and marked with leg bands in 2000-2002 were recaptured or seen
   again in subsequent years. We do not recommend the rise of harnesses on
   diving ducks and sea ducks as it may affect their behavior and survival,
   at least for birds wintering in areas where conditions are severe.}},

Abstract = {{Nine years (1989/90-2002) of data on a asynchronous pelagic seabird. the
   White-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus), breeding on Aride Island,
   Seychelles, were used to examine: (1) annual variation in productivity
   and, (2) the importance of large scale (El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern
   Oscillation) factors in explaining productivity levels. In 2001 and
   2002, we examined the influence of local scale factors(parasitism by
   hard ticks Amblyomma loculosum and intra- and inter-specific competition
   for nest-sites) on productivity. Productivity between years only ranged
   from 0.21 to 0.37 chicks/breeding pair, but it was nevertheless
   significantly and inversely correlated with the El Ni (n) over tildeo
   index. No influence on productivity was caused by local factors. The
   frequency distribution of chick deaths varied significantly with chick
   age in 2001 but not in 2002. Most of the chick deaths were from
   starvation, in particular for chicks older than 20 days. As opposed to
   synchronous seabird species, there were no years with total breeding
   failure in the White-tailed Tropicbird. This may be partly explained by
   their dispersed feeding in the open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Visits were made to the Xisha Archipelago, northern south China Sea,
   front 13 March to 9 April 2003 and 2 April to 7 September 2004, to
   determine the status of the Red-footed Booby (Sula sula). The Red-footed
   Booby was found to breed only on Dong Island, (area of 1.55 km(2)).
   Random sampling indicated that the island supported approximately 35,500
   breeding pairs. The colony, is the largest in the west Pacific and
   comprises more than 10\% of the estimated world population. It is
   suggested that the island may hold more than 100,000 individuals,
   including fledged birds of the year, and immature and non-breeding
   birds. The Red-footed Booby nests only in Pisonia grandis trees on the
   island, and the most serious threat to the breeding colony, is from a
   herd of introduced cows which are consuming the new P. grandis growth
   that otherwise would develop into potential nesting habitat.
   Recommendations are made for improved protection of birds on the
   Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor), breeding on Xing-Ren Tuo,
   arrived from late March to April and left from mid-July to August. The
   summer group included breeding pairs, non-breeding adults and
   sub-adults, while some transient individuals were observed irregularly.
   After arrival, the birds slept and rested on bare rock on the seashore
   or cliff top. They departed before dusk to feed, returning in the early
   morning. Pairs formed 15 days before the first egg was laid. The
   copulation frequency averaged 0.38 +/- 0.18 times per hour after pairs
   formed, and the highest frequency occurred in the early morning. The
   clutch size was two or three eggs, and the incubation period lasted 26.2
   +/- 1.5 days (range 25-29, N = 6). juveniles left their nest after 30
   days and could fly freely after 36 days. From 1999 to 2003, the hatching

Abstract = {{Butt-end and lock-on aluminum band loss and wear were studied in the
   White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) banded in Spain. The risk of loss of
   butt-end bands increased from 0\% to 85\% in bands of 0 to 12 years.
   However, no loss occurred when storks were banded on the tibia rather
   than in the tarsus. Lock-on metal bands showed a low band loss rate
   throughout. The results indicated that band loss was mainly caused by
   the band opening, probably because of frequent contact with mud and
   water on the tarsus. Aluminum bands should be completely discarded to
   avoid important biases in analyses of population dynamics, dispersal and
   survival of storks and other groups. This is currently already done in
   many banding schemes, but should be applied more generally worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus) predation on the Little
   Auk (Alle alle) during breeding season at the Ariekammen slopes in
   Hornsund was compared between 1983 and 2003-04. During the nestling
   period, gulls killed more Young Little Auks in 1983 than in 2003. During
   the period of the colony departure in 2003, there were more Glaucous
   Gulls present and they killed more Little Auks than 20 years previous.
   Changes were found in the strategy of the colony departure by the Little
   Auk. In 2004, the rate of fledglings departed from the colony during
   ``day{''} hours was higher than in 1983 and a higher proportion of
   fledglings left the colony escorted by more than one adult bird. This
   could be a consequence of general increase in the Glaucous Gull numbers
   or a year-to-year fluctuation and needs further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{The Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) is known for insectivory in their
   breeding range, but they are piscivorous in winter and feed some fish to
   chicks. Fish have potentially high value for chick provisioning because
   of their larger mass, but the relative value of fish and insect diets
   for chick growth is unknown. In 1999-2000, we documented use of fish and
   insects for provisioning chicks at four Black Tern colonies in Maine and
   examined chick growth rates at two colonies (Douglas Pond and Carlton
   Pond) that differed in fish and insect use. Deliveries of fish and
   insects to broods were documented using video cameras and observations
   from blinds, while concurrently measuring chick growth in nest
   enclosures. Fish rise was substantial (> 25\% of deliveries) at three Of
   four colonies. Fish comprised 29\% of items and 56\% of metabolizable
   energy delivered to chicks at Douglas Pond compared to 13\% of items and
   22\% of metabolizeable energy at Carlton Pond. Food delivery rate was
   inversely related to the proportion of large fish in brood diets at
   Douglas and Carlton Ponds and increased with brood age at Carlton Pond
   only, apparently due to high insect use. Chick growth rate did not vary
   with respect to fish and insect composition of diets. It is concluded
   that adults were able to raise chicks through age 12 d at comparable
   growth rates with insect- or fish-dominated diets. Use of fish may be
   more energy efficient for adults, and the capability to use both fish
   and insects may reduce potential variability in food availability during
   the breeding season.}},

   In 2003 and 2004 we used remote still cameras aimed at model nests and
   remote video cameras aimed at occupied Least Tern nests to identify
   predators of Least Terns breeding at Gibson Lake, ail artificial
   breeding area in southwestern Indiana, USA. At the primary breeding
   site, a narrow gravel dike that bisects Gibson Lake (center dike),
   Ring-billed Grills (Larus delawarensis) were responsible for 100\% and
   75\% of known predation events on model nests in 2003 and 2004,
   respectively. Throughout the 2004 breeding season, the proportion of
   model nests disturbed by Ring-billed Grills on the center dike was
   strongly Correlated with their numbers roosting on the center dike. We
   recorded predation by Ring-billed Grills on six Least Tern chicks and
   two eggs in 2004 with remote video cameras. Our evaluation of the
   predator community at Gibson Lake strongly implicated Ring-billed Gulls
   as a major source of mortality for breeding Least Terns.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze the variability observed in the
   food and feeding biology of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in relation
   with environmental factors operating in nonbreeding season in Argentina
   at different spatial and temporal scales. Fish constituted more than
   60\% of the diet of the Common Tern in terms of biomass in all years,
   while insects never exceed 40\%. A total of 25 fish species and nine
   insect species (Orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata and Hemiptera)
   were found in the diet. In four of six years, terns preyed more on
   marine fish (68\%) while in 2001-02 terns foraged mostly on freshwater
   species (60\%). Estuarine fish species were eaten in all years (> 10\%).
   Freshwater prey were found only in seasons with high local rainfall.
   Local windspeed had a significant effect on the daily proportion of
   insects and fish prey found in the diet, with more insects (hence less
   fish) consumed on days with high winds. La Plata River overflow seasons
   were correlated with negatives values of the Southern Oscillation Index
   (SOI). We found less estuarine fish (e.g., Whitemouth Croacker, Pejerrey
   Silverside) after a month with a low SOI value. A positive trend was
   also observed between La Plata river outflow and more marine fish in the
   Common Tern diet. The observed environmental variability in winter
   quarters and the fluctuation in the use of different food sources may
   affect the individual quality of terns and not only the survival of
   individuals during the nonbreeding season but also the timing of
   migration or breeding performance of adults during the following
   reproductive season.}},

Abstract = {{The Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) rarely produces more than one brood per
   breeding cycle. In 1996, 18 of 365 pairs (5\%) of Common Terns nesting
   at a Lake Ontario colony laid second clutches while caring for
   first-brood nestlings; no second clutches were recorded during four
   previous breeding seasons at this location. Second clutches were smaller
   than first clutches of the same pairs (2 versus 3 eggs), and were
   initiated when first broods contained 1-3 nestlings that ranged in age
   from 12-22 d. Success of second clutches was low. Only two nestlings,
   from one second clutch, survived for > 18 d; all remaining second
   clutches were abandoned or predated prior to (N = 16) or just after (N =
   1) hatching. Three proximate factors were examined, within and among
   years, related to the production of second clutches: 1) earlier
   initiation of first broods, 2) reduced parental effort toward first
   broods, and 3) foraging conditions during rearing of first broods.
   Second clutches were not related to earlier breeding or reduced parental
   effort: clutch initiation dates, clutch sizes, and egg volumes of first
   clutches were similar among years, and first-clutch size and initiation
   date did not differ between pairs producing one versus two clutches.
   Conversely, parental care patterns in 1996 had several Unusual
   characteristics compared to other years, including: (1) shorter
   provisioning trips, (2) higher provisioning rates, and (3) reduced rates
   of kleptoparasitism. These characteristics suggest that an abundant food
   supply close to the colony in 1996 was the likely proximate explanation
   for second-clutching.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) were radio-tagged on their
   wintering grounds at Lagoa do Peixe, Rio Grande do Sul state, southern
   Brazil. Aerial radio-tracking was made along 850 km from northern Rio
   Grande do Sul state to Montevideo, Uruguay. During 23.6 h of tracking in
   February 2003, we recorded 100 locations of 12 radio-tagged terns. Birds
   were located within a range of 165 km from the tagging area, and most
   locations were at sea (74 at sea vs. 26 roosting on the beach), due to
   frequent movement of the birds when feeding and most tracking during
   feeding periods. Each bird was located 4-14 times (mean = 8.3
   locations/bird). Common Terns fed predominantly between 15-20 m isobaths
   (56\% of at sea locations), and 10-15 m isobaths (32\%), which
   corresponded to a maximum of 8 km offshore. Minimum distance traveled in
   five days of intensive tracking was 46 km, and maximum distance was 167
   km. Daily movement was 19 km on average (minimum 6 kin d(-1), maximum 49
   km d(-1)). Nine out of 12 birds were found at sea in both early morning
   and late afternoon periods. Eight out of 12 birds were recorded feeding
   at sea in consecutive periods of the day (morning and afternoon),
   indicating two feeding trips a day.}},

Abstract = {{Despite Current anthropogenic alterations to riparian areas and littoral
   zones of lakes, little information is available on how human-induced
   alterations affect lacustrine habitat use by many piscivorous birds in
   northern Wisconsin, USA. The influence of lake characteristics and human
   disturbance on species richness and the presence of seven species of
   piscivorous birds was determined on 98 lakes located primarily in Vilas
   and Oneida counties, Wisconsin. Lakes were surveyed for species presence
   using shoreline perimeter surveys with total searching time standardized
   to two, one-hour surveys per lake. Piscivorous bird species richness was
   highest on large lakes with high pH levels. Using logistic regression,
   many species were found to be present on lakes possessing
   characteristics associated with high abundances of fish, including lake
   surface area, pH, and water clarity. At least one of these variables was
   included in the final models for species richness and presence of the
   Common Merganser (Mergus merganser), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias), and Ring-billed Gull
   (Larus delawarensis). Three species avoided lakes possessing
   characteristics associated with high levels of human disturbance; the
   Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) was not found on lakes with low percentages
   of macrophytes, the Common Merganser was absent on lakes with low water
   clarity, and the Common Loon (Gavia immer) was not present on lakes with
   many cottages. Many species of piscivorous birds were widespread
   regardless of the degree of human development, indicating that
   habituation to humans may have occurred. In addition, density-dependent
   factors may have precluded identification of optimal lake
   characteristics for some species due to habitat saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Large colonies of nesting cicoiniform birds have recently become an
   important tourist attraction in the Brazilian Pantanal. Visits to these
   colonies are uncontrolled and there is growing concern about disturbance
   to the breeding birds. In 1998, an experiment was conducted using
   different treatments Within a single large, heavily visited colony to
   assess the effects of different kinds of tourist viewing on the
   breeding, behavior and nesting success of the Wood Stork (Mycteria
   americana). Pedestrian viewing, when more than 75 m from the nearest
   active nest, produced no detectable change in breeding success or
   behavior. However, boats passing within 20 m of nests were associated
   with significant changes in the nine budgets of incubating adult storks.
   Most breeding failure occurred prior to hatching and was significantly
   higher in the boat-treatments in comparison with controls. It is
   suggested that the elevated level of nest failure observed in the
   boat-treatment group is evidence of biologically significant
   disturbance. These conclusions are supported by observations taken in
   2000 when boats were excluded from the colony. Behavioral responses at
   the time of disturbance are typically used as indicators of effects when
   determining safe approach distances for birds. However, in this study
   behavior during disturbances was unrelated to the eventual effect of
   disturbance. These findings have been incorporated into suggestions for
   the measurement of disturbance and management of tourist visits to bird
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the foraging behavior of the Double-crested Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax auritus) on Oneida Lake, NewYork, by monitoring the
   activities of 27 radio-tagged birds in July and August of 1999 and 2000.
   A total of 224 locations were obtained of cormorants actively diving,
   and presumed foraging, at the time of detection. A geographic
   information system was used to examine foraging distances front the
   nesting island, the water depth and type of substrate at preferred
   foraging sites, and to estimate kernel home ranges for analysis of
   individual foraging site fidelity. An explanatory model was developed to
   determine parameters affecting the distance to cormorant foraging sites.
   The mean distance to foraging locations of tagged cormorants from the
   colony site was 2,920 m (SE 180 m, max = 14,190 m), and 52\% of the
   locations were within 2,000 m of the nesting island. No cormorant was
   observed making daily foraging trips to outside water bodies. Mean
   foraging distance was greater during morning than in the afternoon, and
   there was a significant effect of the time of day on distance. There was
   no significant effect of sex date, a seasonal measure on distance to
   foraging location. Individual cormorants exhibited fidelity to specific
   foraging sites. Most cormorants foraged in close proximity to the
   nesting island much of the time, while those detected further from the
   island tended to return repeatedly to the same locations. Ninety percent
   of the foraging locations were in water depths <= 7.5 m, and most were
   in water 2.5-5 m deep. Compositional analysis of habitat use revealed a
   preference for these depths, along with substrates of cobble with
   rubble, and silt with clay.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrororax carbo) was studied on the
   Finnish side of gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, by collecting regurgitated
   fish in a colony. Most abundant species of fish were Viviparous Blenny
   (Zoarces viviparus), Roach (Rutilus rutilus) and Perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), most of which are economically unimportant. Cormorants
   switched their diet during the breeding season. Before young were
   hatched. cormorants ate mainly Roach and Perch; when young were less
   than 25 days, old they ate mainly small Viviparous Blennies. Later,
   adults provided larger Roach and Perch for their young. The results
   suggest that several fish-sampling visits are needed to record the food
   captured by cormorants during the breeding season. Few samples
   restricted in time may bias the composition of fish species and size of
   the fish in diet.}},

Abstract = {{One possible explanation for the evolution of white plumage in herons is
   an adaptive advantage for foraging. Under this hypothesis, white plumage
   is cryptic to aquatic prey; thus white-plumaged birds may be more prone
   to forage in deep water habitats, where they would be cryptic, using
   passive foraging tactics. Dark-plumaged birds foraging in shallow water
   habitats, where they are presumably more visible, use active tactics.
   These hypotheses were tested by investigating choice of water depth and
   choice of foraging tactics by conducting paired foraging observations
   between color morphs within the Plumage dimorphic Reddish Egret (Egretta
   rufescens). Water was divided into four depths classes: deep (> 15 cm),
   intermediate (5-15 cm), shallow (1-5 cm), and mudflat (< 1 cm). There
   was no difference in time spent in different water depth classes between
   the two color morphs of the Reddish Egret. However, there was a
   significant interaction between color morph and depth of water for time
   spent actively foraging. The white morph of the Reddish Egret was more
   active in intermediate depths of water than the dark-morph while the
   dark morph was more active in shallow depths of water. These results
   support the hypothesis that Reddish Egrets may alter foraging tactics
   based on their degree of crypsis to preys.}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese Egret (Egretta eulopholes) is a globally threatened species
   with little quantitative data oil its breeding biology. Observations
   conducted in 2003 at Xing-Ren Tuo in Liaoning Province indicated that
   the species had a low within-pair copulation frequency and a relatively
   high extra-pair copulation frequency The occurrence of extra-pair
   copulations depended Upon the absence of the cuckolder's mate and the
   cuckolded male. There was an asynchronous fading in bill color between
   sexes after laying, which probably accounted for the male's preference
   for an egg-laying female its extra-pair mate. Ground nesting induced a
   modified tactic: the male approached another nest by walking covertly,
   which led successful mounting of the female.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the composition and abundance pattern of species across
   sites is a central question in community ecology. However, the structure
   of waterbird assemblages in fragmented wetlands has been poorly
   documented. We carried out twelve monthly censuses to describe the
   composition and abundance patterns in 42 wetland fragments and two
   lagoons in the coastal zone of Rio Grande do Sul, South Brazil. A total
   of 142,000 birds from 66 species, 18 families and 18 orders were
   recorded. Most species were either resident (29) or partial migrants
   (19). All migrant species (8 nearctic, 4 austral and 5 summer breeders)
   were recorded in small numbers and most of them were restricted to
   lagoons. The lagoons had more species (60) than the wetland fragments
   (55), even though the total fragment area (1,426 ha) was about twice the
   censed area in the lagoons (743 ha). Principal Coordinate Analysis
   revealed strong temporal and spatial gradients of abundance and
   composition that were similar in fragments and lagoons. The number of
   species varied among sites and showed no seasonal pattern. Abundances
   were higher in the wintering period (min. of 2,500 birds in March and
   max. of 23,000 in July) due to the increased abundance of Gruiformes and
   Anseriformes. The White-faced Whistling-duck (Dendrocygna viduata) and
   the Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) were the most abundant and
   frequent species over the year, comprising together 69\% of the total.
   The census captured 76\% and 60\% of the waterbird species listed for
   the region and the Rio Grande do Sul State, respectively. The study area
   shared more than 90\% of the species with the nearby States and 76\%
   with the Pantanal region. The beta-diversity among sites was 94\% when
   only fragments are considered, and 38\% when the lagoons are included in
   the calculation, showing that a great proportion of the waterbird
   richness at the landscape scale is accommodated as a beta component. The
   local abundance and composition of waterbird assemblages seemed to be
   affected by the interplay of several factors, including the rich
   regional pool of species, their wide range, the fragment area, the
   surrounding matrix and the presence of core refuges. A landscape
   perspective is essential on building sound conservation programs for
   waterbird assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) nests were monitored at Falkner Island,
   Connecticut, USA between 1998 and 2002. A total of 586 chicks were sexed
   and their growth measured during the first three days. These data were
   used to derive growth parameters and predict survival to fledging with
   high confidence. In contrast to a previous study in Massachusetts, we
   found no sex-ratio bias at hatching in any single year or in all years
   combined, nor was there a bias at fledging in all years combined, or in
   any single year. This difference is interesting because both colonies
   exhibit a female-biased sex ratio at breeding. After controlling for
   other factors, there was no difference in early growth or survival
   between male and female chicks, consistent with our previous studies and
   with the hypothesis that differences in growth and survival between
   males and females observed in other species are due to sexual size
   dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons were made of the foraging ecology of Caspian Terns (Sterna
   caspia) nesting on two islands in the Columbia River estuary using radio
   telemetry and observations of prey fed to chicks and mates at each
   colony. Early in the chick-rearing period, radio-tagged terns nesting at
   Rice Island (river km 34) foraged mostly in the freshwater zone of the
   estuary close to the colony, while terns nesting on East Sand Island
   (river km 8) foraged in the marine or estuarine mixing zones close to
   that colony. Late in the chick-rearing period, Rice Island terns moved
   more of their foraging to the two zones lower in the estuary, while East
   Sand Island terns continued to forage in these areas. Tern diets at each
   colony corresponded to the primary foraging zone (freshwater vs.
   marine/mixing) of radio-tagged individuals: Early in chick-rearing, Rice
   Island terns relied heavily on juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.,
   71\% of identified prey), but this declined late in chick-rearing
   (46\%). East Sand Island terns relied less on salmonids (42\% and 16\%,
   early and late in chick-rearing), and instead utilized marine fishes
   such as Anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Herring (Clupea pallasi).
   Throughout chick-rearing, Rice Island terns foraged farther from their
   colony (median distance: 12.3 km during early chick-rearing and 16.9 km
   during late chick-rearing) than did East Sand Island terns (9.6 and 7.7
   km, respectively). The study leads to the conclusion that Caspian Terns
   are generalist foragers and make use of the most proximate available
   forage fish resources when raising young.}},

Abstract = {{The largest and most productive colony of Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens
   caerulescens) in Alaska for two decades (1980-1999) was on Howe Island
   in the outer Sagavanirktok River Delta. Petroleum development began in
   this area during the mid-1980s, and studies of Snow Geese on Howe Island
   were conducted annually since 1980. Annual gosling production remained
   high and the colony expanded during 1980-1993; thereafter both gosling
   production and colony size declined. During 1980-1993, gosling
   production was highly and positively correlated with mean daily air
   temperature during the 1-25 June incubation period, and predation at the
   colony was insignificant. After 1993, there was an increase in predation
   on Snow Goose eggs at Howe Island by Grizzly Bears (Ursus arctos) and
   other mammalian and avian predators, which resulted in the decline of
   the Howe Island colony. New Snow Goose colonies east of the oil fields
   expanded during the decline on Howe Island. Evidence suggests that this
   eastward expansion likely resulted from dispersal or displacement of
   geese from Howe Island. After 1993, the effects of predation confounded
   the known effects of spring temperatures, and predation became the
   significant factor influencing gosling production. Increased predators
   in the Prudhoe Bay area and at Howe Island were suspected to be linked
   to the availability of human food waste and refuse and to the cessation
   of hunting and trapping in the area. Recently imposed mitigation
   measures have included better refuse and waste management and removal of
   problem bears. These measures should result in reduced predation and
   increased productivity at the Howe Island Snow Goose colony.}},

Abstract = {{Searches for color-banded Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) were
   carried out during 2002-2004 at an inland roost in Spain in order to
   determine the origin of the birds, to measure the length of stay and
   with in and between-seasons site fidelity in relation to age. Contrary
   to expectations, neither the stay duration at the roost nor the site
   fidelity depended on age. The low stay duration (the majority of the
   birds were sighted only once) and return rates suggest nomadic behavior
   of the wintering cormorants. The cormorants that stayed longer at the
   roost also returned there more times during one season, suggesting that
   site fidelity may have an adaptive value for wintering cormorants.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were
   conducted in all suitable nesting habitat in coastal Virginia, USA
   during the 2003 breeding season. The total of 588 pairs more than
   doubles previous estimates for the state, and provides a benchmark for
   the comparison of future surveys. These results suggest that Virginia
   supports the largest number of oystercatchers in the breeding season
   relative to other east coast states. Previous surveys in Virginia
   focused only on one coastal area, the barrier islands. Over two hundred
   pairs recorded in the seaside lagoon system of the Delmarva Peninsula in
   2003 accounted for the large discrepancy between previous estimates for
   the state and the results of this survey. Over 89\% of the total number
   of pairs was observed on the islands and in the lagoon system of the
   Delmarva Peninsula. Approximately 87\% of the pairs were on land that is
   managed or regulated to some degree for the conservation of nesting
   birds by federal, state, municipal and non-governmental organizations,
   including 20\% that occurred on land closed to public use during the
   bird-breeding season. Only 13\% of the pairs were on land that affords
   no protection to breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal activities and foraging methods of juvenile, parent (adults with
   young), and non-parent (adults without young) Tundra Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus) were measured during autumn and spring migration at Long
   Point, Ontario, to evaluate: 1) age-related differences in activities
   and feeding methods of family members, 2) potential short-term
   behavioral costs and benefits of prolonged parent-offspring association,
   and 3) several predictions based on predation risk and swan social
   structure. Vigilance of inactive parents and juveniles declined as flock
   size increased at observation sites. However, other evaluations of
   vigilance in active (and inactive parent/nonparent) swans and use of
   risk-prone foraging methods did not support the hypothesis that swans
   respond to reduced risk of predation resulting from membership in larger
   flocks. These results may be due to their use of inaccessible aquatic
   habitats and their large relative size, both of which relate to their
   lack of natural predators, at staging areas. Both parents and young used
   sub-surface feeding methods to the same amount, but parents
   ``treadled{''} more than did juveniles and juveniles ``dabbled{''} more
   on the surface than did parents. These findings suggest that some degree
   of resource partitioning exists between parents and young or possibly
   parents indirectly facilitate feeding activities of their young. Parents
   were more vigilant and interacted with other social groups more than did
   juveniles, but their feeding activity was unaffected as both parents and
   juveniles spent similar time foraging. Time spent vigilant, in
   intraspecific interactions, and feeding was similar between parents and
   non-parents. Based on this evidence, parents did not appear to incur
   short-term behavioral or energetic costs of prolonged association with
   young. However, both parents and juveniles likely benefited from higher
   social standing associated with family status or larger family size.}},

   was studied in southern most Sweden. Among more than 1,500 Mute Swans
   (C. olor) only 2.6\% had attending waterfowl whereas 41\% of Whooper
   Swans (C. cygnus) and 51\% of Tundra Swans (C. columbianus bewicki) had
   associated commensals, no doubt because of the species' different
   feeding techniques. Four species of commensals occurred at the main
   study site, Eurasian Wigeon (Anas penelope), Mallard (A. platyrhynchos),
   Pochard (Aythya ferina) and Common Coot (Fulica atra), wigeon making up
   about a third of the individuals. A mean of 3.4 waterfowl attended each
   Whooper Swan. Aggression was common among the commensals, with
   intraspecific aggression being more common than interspecific aggression
   in both wigeon and Pochard, and apparently influenced the size and
   composition of the groups and also the individuals' positions relative
   to the swan. The preferred position just behind the swan was defended by
   threats and attacks. Although wigeon in this position did not have
   higher pecking rates they obtained significantly more large items than
   wigeon farther behind the swan.}},

Abstract = {{We retrospectively conducted a survey of blood lead levels in Mute Swans
   (Cygnus olor) admitted to a Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
   to Animals wildlife centre with injuries caused by collision with power
   lines or other overhead cables. Of 72 birds admitted over a three-year
   period, four birds were dead on arrival and 14 were euthanased on
   arrival due to severe injuries or burns. Of the surviving 54 birds, 43
   were sampled to determine blood lead levels and 63\% of these had
   elevated lead levels (> 1.21 mu mol/l). We also blood sampled 260 swans
   admitted with symptoms consistent with exposure to lead that had not
   been involved in collisions and 620 birds admitted for all other reasons
   that had also not been in collisions. There was no significant
   difference in the proportion of collision birds with low (< 1.21 mu
   mol/l) or intermediate (> 2 < 5 mu mol/l) lead levels compared to
   non-collision birds. However, a significantly larger proportion of birds
   admitted following collision with power lines had moderately elevated
   blood lead levels (1.21-2 mu mol/l) compared to non-collision birds and
   a significantly smaller proportion had high blood lead levels (> 5 mu
   mol/l). Adults accounted for 72\% of admissions following collision and
   there was no significant difference between the proportion of collision
   and non-collision birds that were adults. Our data suggest that birds
   with elevated but moderate blood lead levels suffer an increase risk of
   collision, while those with intermediate to high levels have a much
   reduced risk of collision, possibly because they are too weak to fly.
   Inexperience does not appear to be a significant factor in determining
   the risk of collision.}},

Abstract = {{The highly herbivorous Gadwall (Anas strepera) is the most salt-tolerant
   of the North America dabbling ducks and typically breeds in wetlands
   where salinity does not exceed 15 parts per thousand.. Small numbers
   also breed at hypersaline (80-90 parts per thousand) Mono Lake,
   California, which lacks vascular plants. There, Gadwall raise young on
   the open lake, feed nearly exclusively on alkali flies (Ephydra hians),
   and minimize osmotic challenges by concentrating activities in areas
   with access to fresh water. Fledging success is high as a result of
   abundant food and low predation, but is evidently offset by poor
   survivorship among postbreeding adults. Failure to complete wing molt
   and, perhaps, foot disease are implicated. Food in the lake remains
   abundant well into the autumn. Nevertheless, local birds leave as soon
   as the young fledge. Many move to nearby freshwater lakes before
   eventually before continuing to wintering locations in the Central
   Valley of California. Migrants avoid Mono Lake at this season in favor
   of nearby freshwater lakes. Overall, Mono Lake's value for breeding and
   migrating ducks is low, because of harsh water chemistry, limited fresh
   water for drinking and marshes for feeding, and apparent low survival
   among adults.}},

Abstract = {{Distributional and dietary responses of wintering Steller's Eiders
   (Polysticta stelleri) to spring spawning of Baltic Herring (Clupea
   harengus) were studied along the Lithuanian coast of the Baltic Sea.
   Herring spawn is patchy, but is abundant and energy-rich when present.
   The objective of this study was to determine whether Steller's Eiders
   modified their foraging sites and food habits to take advantage of
   spawn, or whether they were inflexible foragers as suggested by earlier
   studies. Steller's Eiders altered their habitat use during herring
   spawn, moving to habitats where fish spawning occurred. Also, diet
   analysis demonstrated that herring eggs became an important food when
   available. Although the importance of herring spawn for Steller's Eiders
   remains speculative, this study indicates that spawning sites could be
   important as a source of nutrients and energy for subsequent migration
   or reproduction, and should receive conservation consideration.}},

Abstract = {{solitary breeders aggressively defending their territories. Others,
   including the Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus), can breed in
   colonies or as solitary pairs, suggesting that individuals are able to
   change from a solitary strategy to a more social pattern. This paper
   concentrates on observations during colony establishment and nesting in
   a colony of Great Crested Grebes near Lake Ijssel in the Netherlands.
   The arrival of the grebes at the colony and their egg laying was spread
   over a long period. From the start, the breeding birds tended to use the
   entire area of the vegetation available for building nest platforms and
   this led to a progressive reduction in the distances between neighboring
   pairs. The final nesting density was extremely high, with 14.3 nest
   platforms per 100 m(2). On average, each nest held 3.75 eggs. The
   crowded nesting of the Great Crested Grebe was imposed upon the birds
   because of the absence of sufficient suitable nesting habitat. It is
   suggested that the extent of aggregation is dictated by the quality of
   the site and the ability of the grebes to reduce their aggressiveness
   towards one another. Social behavior did not primarily contribute to the
   breeding aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding ecology of the Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) was studied
   during the 2002-03 breeding season at Coquimbo, northern Chile. Food
   composition was studied by analyzing pellets regurgitated by Kelp Gulls
   living in different habitats. Birds breeding or resting near fishing
   ports used these as their main feeding grounds. Birds breeding on
   offshore islands fed mainly on intertidal organisms and olives. A
   comparison between the food of breeders and non-breeding birds during
   the breeding season showed a difference in diet composition of breeders,
   who fed more on fish of high energy density while non-breeding birds
   continued feeding on a wide range of organisms and waste. Observations
   in a fishing harbor and at sea demonstrated that fisheries waste was an
   important food source for the birds. The inshore distribution at sea was
   related to the location of fishing ports and breeding colonies.}},

Abstract = {{During 1999-2002, we studied the abundance of fish-eating birds,
   primarily Ring billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) and California Gulls
   (L. californicus), and estimated their consumption of fish at Horn
   Rapids Dam and the Chandler Irrigation Canal return pipe on the Yakima
   River in eastern Washington. Earlier observations of gulls at these
   structures suggested a high level of predation of juvenile salmonids.
   The relationship between river flow, gull use at the sites and fish
   taken was also examined. Numbers of gulls (instantaneous counts of
   foraging and non-foraging individuals) at the structures varied daily
   between their arrival in late March-early April and departure in late
   June. Daily averages across the four years were 9.8 (SE +/- 1.5) and
   19.1 (SE +/- 2.5) gulls at Horn Rapids and Chandler, respectively. Gull
   numbers at Horn Rapids peaked dramatically during the last two weeks in
   May, reaching maxima of 37 (SE +/- 2.2) to 133 (SE +/- 4.2) gulls/day.
   This increase appeared to be associated with the hatchery release of one
   to two million juvenile autumn Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) above
   the dam. A comparable peak in gull abundance was not observed at
   Chandler. Diurnal patterns of gull abundance differed between sites and
   among years. Relationships between fish take and water flow also varied
   within and among years at the two sites. Low seasonal flows were
   associated with increased predation at Chandler, whereas high seasonal
   flows were associated with increased predation at Horn Rapids. Assuming
   all fish taken were salmonids, consumption at both sites combined was
   estimated to be <= 10.3\% of the juvenile salmonids passing the two
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{We studied numbers and productivity of the European White Stork (Ciconia
   ciconia) during 19682002 at Klopot village colony (in the Odra River
   valley, Poland) and their response to water level and livestock farming.
   The number of nesting pairs (range 19-33) fluctuated independently of
   the April and June water level, but correlated with the presence of a
   local livestock farm. The average number of chicks fledged per pair was
   negatively correlated with the water level in April, when White Storks
   choose the breeding area. The White Stork appears to use farming
   activity rather than water level in making a decision as to where to a
   settle. This result suggests that changes in management practices, which
   are relatively easily made, may improve demographic parameters of local
   breeding White Storks.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the lower Rahway River, New jersey, to wading birds
   was investigated, and foraging patterns and interspecific differences in
   wading bird microhabitat use are described. Foraging decisions by wading
   birds are complex and occur at several levels. In order to examine
   foraging decisions at the habitat and microhabitat levels, 79 censuses
   were conducted by boat along a 5-km tidal section of this river in 1988,
   1998, 1999, and 2002. The locations of 1,148 birds were recorded on
   maps, and patterns of microhabitat use were determined. Overall, year,
   date, and tide level were important predictors for the numbers of wading
   birds that were recorded. However, each species responded to a different
   combination of variables: for Great Egret it was year and date; for
   Snowy Egret date and tide level; and for Glossy Ibis year, date, and
   tide level. Tide flow direction was not important for any species. For
   all three species, spatial distributions long the river were clumped
   rather than uniform, which were associated with physical characteristics
   along this section of the river. All three species used the mouths of
   narrow tidal creeks more frequently than expected, but species differed
   in the use of mudflats and areas of slow-moving water. There was little
   overlap among species in spatial distribution along the river, but the
   overall use of microhabitats was broadly similar. This study suggests
   that the lower Rahway River estuary in New jersey is valuable to local
   wildlife and should be considered in future development plans.}},

Abstract = {{Available information on the breeding biology of the Great Bittern
   (Botaurus stellaris) is poor. New data are presented on nest description
   and distribution, breeding phenology, clutch and brood sizes, egg
   biometrics and breeding success, based on 27 nests at one French and
   three Italian sites. Nest shape and breeding phenology appeared at least
   partially linked to environmental factors. Breeding success was studied
   for the first time to the fledging stage using radio-tagging young.
   About 30\% of eggs produced fledging young, and it is suggested that
   starvation was the main cause of chick death. Young moved away from the
   nest when about 15-days old and extensive dispersal occurred within 2-3
   weeks from independence. A survey of the literature indicates
   variability in several breeding parameters and suggests that the Great
   Bittern is an adaptable bird.}},

Abstract = {{Common Murre (Uria aalge) breeding success has been monitored in
   1996-2004 at Devil's Slide Rock, California as part of a restoration
   project related to the Apex Houston oil spill. During the 2001 breeding
   season, two separate cases of egg recovery by parent murres were
   observed. During the first event an egg was secured and incubated 60 cm
   from the original nesting site, while in the second case an egg was
   retrieved after rolling 85 cm. The first egg was lost within 24 hours,
   and the second disappeared within a day of its expected hatching date.
   We describe the circumstances surrounding these events, including the
   behavior of the parent murres during the egg recovery attempts, the
   subsequent fate of the recovered eggs, the microhabitat features
   associated with egg loss and other factors affecting the egg recovery
   ability of adult murres.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas are important habitats for
   North American wintering waterfowl and migrant shorebirds. However,
   shorebird breeding biology has been overlooked in characterizing the
   region's ecological importance. In 1998 and 1999, American Avocet
   (Recurvirostra americana), Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus),
   Killdeer (Charadrius vocferous), and Snowy Plover (C. alexandrinus)
   breeding ecology were studied in playas, saline lakes, and riparian
   wetlands in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas. Chronology of nest
   initiation, clutch sizes, and hatching success for 298 Snowy Plover, 111
   American Avocet, 43 Killdeer, and 26 Blacknecked Stilt clutches were
   measured. All four species nested in saline lakes, American Avocet and
   Killdeer also nested in playas, and Snowy Plover nested on riparian
   wetlands. American Avocet had higher hatching success in 1999 (52\%)
   than 1998 (8\%), because of more suitable hydrological conditions and
   lower predation. Hatching success was higher in 1998 than 1999 for
   Killdeer (1998, 63\%; 1999, 21\%) and Snowy Plover (1998, 47\%; 1999,
   33\%) due to failures caused by flooding and hail in 1999. In other
   regions, clutch predation limits shorebird productivity, but hatching
   success in the Playa Lakes Region appears to be limited by unpredictable
   precipitation patterns and wetland hydroperiod. As such, breeding
   shorebird conservation and management should focus upon maintaining
   wetland hydrological integrity.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, parental activities of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) were
   monitored in three coastal colonies during a series of 24-h long
   observation periods to document attendance, foraging, and other
   activities in relation to time of day, tide level, and breeding stage.
   During 5,400 nest-hours of observations, nest attendance declined and
   feeding rates increased with nestling developmental stage. Although some
   feeding arrivals occurred during darkness, the great majority of
   arrivals (including feeding) occurred during daylight periods. Mean
   times of return from feeding trips varied significantly among colonies
   and nestling developmental stages. Feeding arrivals were linked to
   tides, suggesting that most foraging occurred during the preceding low
   tide period. Inter-colony variation in foraging arrival times and
   interactions with tides were likely associated with differences in
   proximity to foraging sites and availability of both tidal and non-tidal
   (freshwater) foraging habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The Caribbean Coot (Fulica caribaea) is endemic to the Caribbean region
   where it is uncommon to rare. Little is known about its breeding
   biology. From museum specimens, archives and correspondence, we document
   134 records for Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, from
   the years 1955-2004, and map their distribution. The islands are and and
   rainfall can be unpredictable but with the establishment of permanent
   freshwater ponds since the 1970s, the Caribbean Coot appears to have
   become more common. We recorded 68 cases of breeding for the three
   islands. Although breeding can occur in almost any month, there is a
   clear preponderance for birds to breed in the first few calendar months
   of the year, approximately three months after the annual peak in
   rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) numbers along the east
   coast of the United States are declining in some areas and expanding in
   others. Researchers have suggested that movement from traditional
   barrier beach habitats to novel inland habitats and coastal marshes may
   explain some of these changes, but few studies have documented
   oystercatcher reproductive success in non-traditional habitats. This
   study compares the reproductive success of the American Oystercatcher on
   three river islands in the lower Cape Fear River of North Carolina with
   that of birds nesting on barrier island beach habitat of Cape Lookout
   National Seashore. There were 17.6 times more oystercatcher breeding
   pairs per kilometer on the river island habitat than barrier beach
   habitat. The Mar field estimate of daily nest content survival was 0.97
   (S.E. +/- 0.0039) on river islands, significantly higher than 0.92 (S.E.
   +/- 0.0059) on barrier islands. The primary identifiable cause of nest
   failure on the river islands was flooding while the main cause of nest
   failure on the barrier islands was mammalian predation. Fledging success
   was equally low at both study sites. Only 0.19 chicks fledged per pair
   in 2002, and 0.21 chicks fledged per pair in 2003 on the river islands
   and 0.14 chicks fledged per pair in 2002 and 0.20 chicks fledged per
   pair in 2003 on the barrier islands. Many questions are still unanswered
   and more research is needed to fully understand the causes of chick
   mortality and the functional significance of non-traditional nesting
   habitats for the American Oystercatcher in the eastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the kleptoparasitic behavior of gulls have involved
   intermediate-sized species. This study examined the kleptoparasitic
   relationships between the Pied Oystercatcher (Haematopus longirostris)
   feeding on Surf Clams (Mactra rufescens) and a large gull species, the
   Pacific Gull (Larus pacificus) in the swash zone of an ocean beach in
   Tasmania, Australia. Oystercatchers caught Surf Clams buried in sand
   using visual cues when the clams were covered by shallow water at low
   tide. There was no selection for clam size, possibly because they were
   unable to assess size before capture. Shells were not broken by
   hammering, but by forcing the bill into and between the valves. Handling
   time was prolonged and was significantly related to shell length. The
   profitability of clams (ash-free dry mass of flesh ingested per second
   of handling time) was independent of shell length. Pacific Gulls stole
   8\% of all clams taken by the oystercatchers. The mean length and
   ash-free dry mass of clams stolen (54.3 +/- 0.64 mm; 8.14 +/- 1.5 mg, N
   = 51) were significantly greater than that of all clams (46.8 +/- 0.65
   mm; 5.10 +/- 0.3 mg, N = 98) caught by the oystercatchers. The
   oystercatchers; had frequent rest periods between bouts of foraging,
   suggesting they were able to capture and ingest clams faster than they
   could digest them and experienced a digestive bottleneck. Losses to
   Pacific Gulls probably had no significant effect on the oystercatchers
   as they had adequate feeding time available to compensate.}},

   Gull (L. genei). Avian kleptoparasites attacked 24\% of the Sandwich
   Terns returning to the colony with fish (N = 659) and robbed 5.3\% of
   them. Most terns (85\%) delivered their prey to a mate or chick. Fish
   carried by terns were mainly Clupeiformes species (96\%). Prey size
   declined significantly as the season progressed. The probability of
   attack increased significantly with fish size and declined significantly
   as the season progressed. Most attacks were on terns as they landed to
   deliver their prey. Overall success rate of attacks was 12.5\% and were
   mostly performed by single birds. The time that the terns spent flying
   before landing to deliver prey increased with the size of carried fish.}},

Abstract = {{During 1995, the relationship between the nesting chronology of the
   Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) and the near-shore abundance of fish was
   examined at La Purinera, Sonora, the site of one of the largest known
   Least Tern colonies in northwest Mexico. Fish abundance was measured
   adjacent to the shoreline during early mornings using a beach seine net,
   and the sampling periods corresponded to different phases of the Least
   Tern's annual cycle. During this year, the nesting season (April to
   July) coincided with peak prey fish abundance, and peak hatching of tern
   eggs (early July) coincided with the greatest abundance of fish of
   adequate size for chicks. Departure of the chicks from the area
   coincided with a marked reduction in suitable food in September.
   Collections of fish dropped and left uneaten by Least Terns in the
   colony contained five species, which were also present in the fish
   samples obtained with the beach seine net. The observations on foraging
   adult Least Terns and the collections of fish dropped in the colony
   suggested that the terns were preying mainly upon silversides
   (Leuresthes sardina, Colpichthys vegis) and anchovies (Anchoa spp.).
   Terns foraged mainly on the bay side of the barrier beach where fish
   were more abundant. The results support the idea that seabird breeding
   and food abundance or availability coincide at the time of maximum need,
   when parents feed rapidly growing chicks.}},

Abstract = {{The Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) nests in freshwater wetlands that are
   prone to water level fluctuations, and nest losses to flooding are
   common. We examined temporal patterns in water levels at six sites with
   Black Tern colonies in Maine and determined probabilities of flood
   events and associated nest loss at Douglas Pond, the location of the
   largest breeding colony. Daily precipitation data from weather stations
   and water flow data from a flow gauge below Douglas Pond were obtained
   for 1960-1999. Information on nest losses from three floods at Douglas
   Pond in 1997-1999 were used to characterize small (6\% nest loss),
   medium (56\% nest loss) and large (94\% nest loss) flood events, and we
   calculated probabilities of these three levels of flooding occurring at
   Douglas Pond using historic water levels data. Water levels generally
   decreased gradually during the nesting season at colony sites, except at
   Douglas Pond where water levels fluctuated substantially in response to
   rain events. Annual probabilities of small, medium, and large flood
   events were 68\%, 35\%, and 13\% for nests initiated during 23 May-12
   July, with similar probabilities for early (23 May-12 June) and late (13
   June-12 July) periods. An index of potential nest loss indicated that
   medium floods at Douglas Pond had the greatest potential effect on nest
   success because they occurred relatively frequently and inundated large
   proportions of nests. Nest losses at other colonies were estimated to be
   approximately 30\% of those at Douglas Pond. Nest losses to flooding
   appear to be common for the Black Tern in Maine and related to spring
   precipitation patterns, but ultimate effects on breeding productivity
   are uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal incubating and brooding behavior of the Black Tern (Chlidonias
   niger) was studied at two colonies in successive years in The
   Netherlands. In late evening and early morning, nests were checked
   regularly for female or male nest attendance until or from complete
   darkness. Dining daytime, females incubated eggs 60\% of the time. At
   night, males took over completely, while females spent the night at a
   communal roost more than three km away from the breeding colonies. Few
   females stayed with their downy young at night and more females brooded
   voting, as chicks became older. The total parental breeding investment
   (day, and night) wits equal (51\% for males), but with higher nocturnal
   investment by males, (79\%). From six days after hatching, chicks were
   left unattended at night. The difference between male and female
   nocturnal investment might be explained by the preference for
   self-survival instead of clutch and brood survival. Males probably have
   greater interest in clutch survival than females, as they are not
   certain to maintain the pair bond after egg loss within or between
   seasons, Due to increased human disturbance in Dutch wetlands, chicks
   now leave their tests permanently, more often. This may lead to more
   frequent cases of chick starvation, as sometimes the young cannot find
   alternative.}},

Abstract = {{A number of factors were identified as causes of mortality in 254 (59\%)
   of 431 sea ducks Submitted for necropsy at the USGS-National Wildlife
   Health Center, Madison, Wisconsin from 1975 until 2003. Bacteria causing
   large outbreaks of mortality were Pasteurella multocida and Clostridium
   botulinum Type E. Starvation was responsible for large mortality events
   as well as sporadic deaths of individuals. Lead toxicity, gunshot and
   exposure to petroleum were important anthropogenic factors. Other
   factors that caused mortality were avian pox virus, bacteria
   (Clostridium botulinum Type C, Riemerella analipestifer and Clostridium
   perfringens), fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus and an unidentified fungus),
   protozoans (unidentified coccidia), nematodes (Eustrongylides spp.),
   trematodes (Sphaoidiotrema globulus and Schistosoma spp.),
   acanthocephalans (Polymorphus spp.), predation, cyanide and trauma
   (probably due to collisions). There were also a number of novel
   infectious organisms in free-living sea ducks in North America, which
   were incidental to the death, including avipoxvirus and reovirus,
   bacteria Alycobacterium avium, protozoans Sarcocystis sp. and nematodes
   Streptocara sp. Apart from anthropogenic factors, the other important
   mortality factors listed here have not been studied as possible causes
   for the decline of sea ducks in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Ducks are unusual in that males of many, species acquire brightly
   pigmented plumages in autumn rather than in spring. This has led to
   confusion ill defining molts and plumages, using both traditional
   European terminology and that proposed by Humphrey and Parkes (1959). To
   investigate molt patterns in waterfowl relative to molt and plumage
   nomenclature. 2,227 specimens of duck's and geese were examined. Both
   the ``first prebasic{''} ({''}post-juvenile{''} using traditional
   European terminology) and the ``definitive prebasic{''} ({''}adult
   post-breeding{''}) body molts in most ducks, the latter producing the
   cryptic spring (female) and Summer (male) plumages preceding the wing
   molt, are considerably more variable and less extensive than reported,
   By contrast, the ``definitive prealternate{''} ({''}adult
   pre-breeding{''}) body molt of most ducks, which follows the wing molt
   and produces the brightly colored plumages of males, is complete or
   virtually so. Based upon presumed homolgies with the molts of geese, the
   wing molt and ensuing complete body molt of ducks are better considered
   the prebasic rather than the prealternate molt and, thus, the bright
   feathering of male ducks should be considered the basic plumage. The
   incomplete and ephemeral cryptic plumages, attained by some ducks in
   spring and summer, may have evolved more recently species that benefit
   front camouflage at this time, and should he considered alternate
   plumages. The molts and plumages of the adult Ruddy Duck (Oxyura
   jamaicensis) appear to he homologous, with those of other Anatine ducks,
   with a slight temporal shift in the hormonal cycles that control pigment
   deposition (its opposed to differences in molt patterns) explaining the
   differences in plumage-coloration patterns in males, because feather
   pigment-depostion patterns are controlled by various factors related to
   seasonal and reproductive phenomena, which differ considerably both
   among and within taxa, plumage color should not be a critical factor in
   attempts to define homologous molts and plumages. Received 25 July 2004,
   accepted 12 January 2005.}},

Abstract = {{Models of the Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), that use the tendency of wild
   birds to join foraging aggregations, were used in manipulative
   experiments to test the ability of wild individuals to use environmental
   and social information indicative of patch quality, including pool
   depth, prey accessibility, prey density, and prey exploitation, when
   choosing foraging patches. Snowy Egrets, but not some other aggregation
   species, preferred shallow (< 20 cm) compared to deep (> 40 cm) pools,
   perhaps because they could wade throughout the shallow pools, disturbing
   fish prey and making them more accessible for capture. Snowy Egrets
   responded to an artificial increase in fish density by visiting
   prey-enhanced pools more than pools with most fish removed or
   unmanipulated pools. Snowy Egrets also responded to a decrease in prey
   density resulting from recent exploitation by aggregations by visiting
   these pools less than unmanipulated pools. These results indicate that,
   in addition to the presence of other individuals, Snowy Egrets used
   discernible pool characteristics such as depth, as well as the
   availability and density of prey when choosing patches in which to
   forage. Received 2 March 2004, accepted 25 August 2004.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging by Grey Herons (Ardea cinerea) on fish regurgitated by Great
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) was investigated in large mixed colony
   (ca. 10,000 pairs of cormorants and 700 pairs of herons) at Katy
   Rybackie (north Poland). Experiments with displaying fish in different
   parts of the mixed and monospecific colonies were carried out. Herons
   took fish only within the area of mixed nests. Herons foraged on
   regurgitated fish during the whole breeding season but most intensively
   (tip to 18\% of all birds) in the fledging period. The main foraging
   area of herons (the Vistula Lagoon) has abundant food and is situated
   close to the colony. The fish regurgitated by cormorants constituted an
   important source of food for fledglings in the critical period after
   leaving the nest and was an alternative or supplementary food for adult
   birds during a period of bad weather. Extra food available in the colony
   could be responsible for high breeding success of the herons in the
   mixed colony at Katy Rybackie. Received 6 July 2004, accepted 30

Abstract = {{Ground-truthing surveys were conducted in conjunction with a statewide
   aerial survey of Florida wading bird colonies to evaluate the efficacy
   of the aerial technique. Five species, Brown Pelican (Pelecanus
   occidentalis), Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Anhinga
   (Anhinga anhinga), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), and Wood Stork
   (Mycteria americana), were most often detected during the aerial survey.
   Most of these species are large birds that tend to nest higher in the
   canopy or are white-plumaged, and therefore would be expected to be more
   visible from the air. Five other species, Tricolored Heron (Egretta
   tricolor), Reddish Egret (E. rufescens), Black-crowned Night Heron
   (Nycticorax nycticorax), Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa
   violaceus), and Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), were not detected
   during the aerial survey, presumably because these dark-plumaged species
   typically nest beneath the tree canopy. Disagreement between aerial and
   ground survey results also was caused by the inability of the aerial
   survey to detect some species when they were present in larger colonies
   or distinguish resting birds from breeding birds. The aerial detection
   rate of 45 previously unknown colonies was about 71\%. Recommendations
   for improving future aerial Surveys of colonial waterbirds include more
   use of ground surveys for smaller species of day herons and night herons
   to augment aerial information and smaller width of flight corridors.

Abstract = {{The coastal grasslands of eastern Buenos Aires Province (Argentina) are
   used by Rufous-chested Dotterel (Charadrius modestus), Tawny-throated
   Dotterel (Oreopholus ruficollis), American Golden Plover (Pluvialis
   dominica) and Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis). These
   species differ in size but all use visual pecking when feeding. The diet
   of each species was studied, measuring temporal variation in the
   abundance of invertebrates and dietary preferences of invertebrates.
   From March 1996 to January 1999, feces were collected of shorebirds on
   Medaland Ranch grasslands (Villa Gesell District, Buenos Aires Province,
   Argentina). Pitfall traps were used to capture surface-active
   invertebrates (from June 1996 until March 1998). All four bird species
   ate animal and plant items. In all cases, plant fragments rather than
   seeds dominated the plant fraction. Beetles comprised the dominant item
   in all four species of shorebirds. Earthworms were important for
   Patagonian shorebirds, but they were less frequent in the diets of
   Nearctic shorebirds. Relative use (proportion in the diet) of items
   differed by site and date. Numbers of captures were high in
   spring-summer and low in autumn-winter. All shorebird species preferred
   adult beetles. Rufous-chested Dotterel and Nearctic shorebirds also
   showed a preference for beetle larvae. In contrast, spiders and ants
   were avoided by all shorebird species. Diet information from Nearctic
   shorebirds at other sites in the Northern Hemisphere and in South
   America, confirmed that co-occurring species within a given region
   typically had similar diets, but that the same species in different
   regions showed low similarity. Dietary flexibility allows exploitation
   of-variable resources and, as a consequence, is highly advantageous to
   shorebirds that migrate over long distances and use a variety of
   habitats. Received 3 March 2003, 10 February 2005.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of long-term predator removal in urbanized areas is poorly
   understood. The impact of predation on ground-nesting waterbirds, as
   well as predator abundance and composition in predator removal versus
   non-removal or reference sites were examined at South San Francisco Bay.
   The success of natural nests and predator activity was monitored using
   track plates, trip cameras, wire haircatchers and simulated nests.
   Removal sites had higher nest densities, but lower hatching success than
   reference sites. Predator composition and abundance were not different
   at the removal and reference sites for any predator other than feral Cat
   (Felis domesticus). Striped Skunk (Mephilis mephitis) comprised the
   majority (84\%) of predators removed, yet remained the most abundant
   predators in removal and reference sites. Urban environments provide
   supplemental food that may influence skunks and other nest predators to
   immigrate into vacancies created by predator removal. Based on the
   findings from this study, predator removal should be applied intensively
   over a larger geographic area in order to be a viable management
   strategy for some mammalian species in urbanized areas. Received 3 June

Abstract = {{The applicability of color infrared photography to indirectly predict
   prey abundance for shorebirds was tested by measuring the chlorophyll
   concentrations of primary producers on the mudflat surface at eleven
   migratory stopover sites of shorebirds in Georgia Strait, British
   Columbia during southward migration in July and August 2002. Many
   shorebirds are associated with regions of high coastal zone
   productivity, which may contribute to high prey abundance. Chlorophyll
   levels of primary producers contribute to the red tones of an infrared
   photograph. The hue of an infrared photograph was positively related to
   the chlorophyll concentration of the sediment surface across 11 sites.
   However, invertebrate density was not strongly related to surficial
   sediment chlorophyll concentration or photograph hue. The color infrared
   photography method is useful to quickly assess the surficial sediment
   concentration of the phytobenthos, but of low value to estimate
   invertebrate prey densities.}},

Abstract = {{A monthly shorebird census in Mondego estuary, Portugal was made during
   ten years (1993-2002) and the information adds to the midwinter census
   carried out at international level. It is shown that higher variability
   in shorebird community occurred during the breeding and migrating
   periods, while the winter assemblage was very similar among years. The
   study provides precise information of the importance of the Mondego
   estuary, and the trends and phenology of its shorebird community. Six
   species are responsible for a large proportion of the total abundance
   throughout the year. Dunlin (Calidris alpina) is the most abundant
   species, followed by the Avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta). Over the study
   period, there was a significant increase in the total number of
   shorebirds that occur in some months. This was mainly due to the
   increase of the main species, the Dunlin. Only the Avocet showed a
   significant decrease in abundance. These trends were not explained by
   changes in overall flyway population or the Portuguese totals.
   Therefore, local explanations need to be considered (e.g., changes on
   habitat quality).}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Feeding Black-faced Spoonbills (Platalea minor) were studied in four
   main areas along the coasts of South Korea, Taiwan, China and Vietnam.
   They fed on nekton, mainly fish and shrimps, varying in length between
   2-21 cm that were caught by sweeping the bill in the water. The feeding
   behavior of a spoonbill is a chain of feeding and inter-feeding bouts.
   Each feeding bout started by putting the bill into the water and ended
   when the bill was taken out and, any prey, captured was swallowed. The
   times between feeding bouts were short and no or few steps were made. In
   a complete feeding bout, up to three functional phases were
   distinguished. These were successively (1) the attempt to locate a prey,
   (2) the attempt to catch the located prey, (3) the handling and
   swallowing of the prey. A feeding bout could end in any phase. A total
   of 1,684 feeding bouts were recorded of which 65\% ended with swallowing
   prey. The mean outcome was 45.4 small (< 5 cm long) and 1.3 large (> 5
   cm long) prey per 10 min. Tentative measurements indicated that a
   feeding spoonbill walked on average 3.87 m per 10 s, during which time
   the bill made 15.7 sweeps with a bill velocity of 5.8 km.h(-1),
   meanwhile testing about 17\% of the area within reach of their bill for
   the presence of food. Feeding by Black-faced Spoonbills often looked
   chaotic because they usually walk all over the feeding site at a
   variable speed, while showing a large variety of actions especially when
   large prey is present. However, analyses of the observations show that
   they behave efficiently and reduce time and energy spent in feeding in
   several ways, including giving-up times not much longer than the
   duration of bouts with success, pursuing only large prey, ceasing
   feeding and starting to rest or going to another site when no prey is
   caught in 5-10 min. With their tactile way of feeding on invisible prey,
   they also behaved efficiently by consuming all detected prey that could
   be caught and swallowed.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behavior of adult and recently fledged juvenile Squacco
   Herons (Ardeola ralloides) was studied during the breeding season at the
   Axios Delta, northern Greece. Adults were more efficient foragers than
   young birds and they had a 37\% higher success per peck rate. The
   majority of adults captured some large prey items, while most juveniles
   caught only small prey. A comparison between the two age classes, as
   well as seasonal trends in adult data, indicated a negative association
   between prey size and foraging rates. Adult and juvenile for aging
   behavior did not vary significantly between morning and evening. Herons
   that moved faster also had higher pecking and capture rates, but a lower
   success ratio. Moving rate did not appear to be correlated with prey
   size. Herons moved at a slower rate along the edge of dense reed beds,
   probably in response to this habitat's physical structure. Adults caught
   a greater proportion large prey items in open-water areas than in areas
   with more vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behavior and feeding locations of the Red-legged Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax gaimardi) were studied at Ria Deseado, Argentina during
   the last week of the incubation period in 1999. VHF radio-transmitters
   were deployed on six nesting adult cormorants. Red-legged Cormorants fed
   during the daylight hours and made 4.0 +/- 0.8 trips per day, with a
   mean duration of 1.2 +/- 0.8 h. Birds spent 27\% of daylight hours away
   from the colony on feeding trips, diving for 96\% of the foraging trip,
   and made a mean of 78 dives per trip. Mean foraging range was 1.9 +/-
   0.9 km, being the shortest of any of the Patagonian cormorant species.
   Red-legged Cormorants fed mainly in shallow waters < 5 m deep and within
   one km from the shore. Most of the feeding trips were undertaken during
   falling tide, when the birds performed the shortest feeding trips with
   maximum diving rates and, probably minimized transit times and maximized
   searching time on the seafloor. Our results show that foraging behavior
   is mainly influenced by environmental factors such as the direction of
   the tide. Red-legged Cormorants seems able to forage by selecting the
   appropriated tidal conditions to minimize foraging effort.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study was made of Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis)
   chick diet at six colonies on rocky islands off the southeast coast of
   France, and which had marked differences in their accessibility to
   landfills. We determined the type of foraging habitat used (landfill,
   other terrestrial habitats, marine habitat) and the number of foraging
   habitats that supplied the food in each regurgitate (one, two or three).
   Landfills were consistently used by gulls from the six colonies, but not
   always as the main foraging habitat (38\% to 83\% of regurgitates). For
   the four colonies off Marseilles (high landfill accessibility), the
   majority of regurgitates contained food from only one foraging habitat
   while, at two colonies with low landfill accessibility, the majority of
   regurgitates each contained food obtained from two foraging habitats.
   Moreover, the Principal Component Analysis performed on diet features
   and landfill accessibility parameters demonstrate a significant inverse
   correlation between landfill accessibility and foraging on terrestrial
   habitats. The results underlined the influence of landfill accessibility
   on the characteristics of the chick's diet. Moreover, they also Suggest
   that during chick rearing, adult gulls shift their diet from a high
   specialization on landfill foraging (brooding period), towards a more
   diversified diet, feeding their chicks by increasing the use of
   terrestrial habitats.}},

Abstract = {{A double-observer approach was used during colony surveys of large gulls
   to estimate nest detection probabilities and unbiased estimates of
   abundance. Several models were developed that incorporate different
   assumptions about the sources of variation in detection probabilities
   (observer, colony, vegetation height). Nine colonies were surveyed in
   which a total of 137 transects were conducted. Although the most likely
   model was a one with a constant nest detection probability, a
   constrained model with observer dependent nest detection probability had
   substantial support. Overall detection probability (probability that a
   nest was detected by at least one of the two observers) was 0.943 (SE
   +/- 0.008). Detection probability for a single observer was lower
   (0.761, SE +/- 0.016). These estimates indicate a relatively high
   underestimation of the population sizes of large gull species when not
   taking into account nest detectability.}},

Abstract = {{Regular counts of Greylag Geese (Anser anser) on the islands of Tiree
   and Coll, Argyll, Scotland have taken place since 1982. In the last 20
   years, there has been a ten-fold increase with numbers leveling out
   since 2000 at ca. 4,000 geese. Breeding productivity, measured as
   percentage young in August flocks and brood sizes, was comparable to
   Greylag Geese on other Hebridean islands. Sightings of 1,002 individuals
   banded since 1998 were largely restricted to the islands, although six
   birds were recorded in other parts of northwest Scotland where
   re-sighting probability was low, indicating dispersal to new areas. The
   large difference between annual productivity and estimated mortality
   rates, coupled with the leveling-off of counts, suggested that moderate
   numbers might be emigrating. Greylag Geese fed primarily on silage
   fields and improved permanent pastures throughout the winter. Goslings
   remained with their parents until early April, when the adults moved to
   relatively remote, uncultivated land to breed. During the non-breeding
   season, the average flock size decreased from 70 to 22 birds. Winter
   home ranges of breeding adults and goslings were smaller than those of
   non-breeding adults and geese in their second winter, suggesting that
   social groups within flocks were out-competed from the preferred feeding
   areas and, as a result, may be more likely to disperse and colonize new
   areas. Geese showed individual and specific preferences for restricted
   parts of potential feeding areas. These basic elements of flock dynamics
   need to be understood when selecting management options. Current
   management, involving wide-scale shooting and scaring, requires
   provision of adequate feeding refuges to prevent dispersion of the
   grazing conflict to other areas, both within and beyond the two islands.}},

Abstract = {{Radio telemetry and diurnal time activity budgets were used to show that
   wintering Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) used different habitats for
   comfort and feeding activities at Merritt Island National Wildlife
   Refuge (Merritt Island), Florida and adjacent estuarine areas.
   Management should take this spatial consideration into account. The same
   data were used to determine if habitat use differed between sexes. Data
   on movements and home range were used to evaluate habitat quality and
   potential effects of human disturbance. Scaup foraged more in impounded
   wetlands and rested more in open estuarine regions. Mean distance
   between diurnal and nocturnal sites was 2.7 km (SE +/- 0.3), and was
   similar between sexes and from mid to late winter. Male and female fixed
   kernel home ranges and core use areas did not differ. Mean fixed kernel
   95\% home range and 50\% core use areas were 15.1 km(2) (SE +/- 2.0) and
   2.7 km(2) (SE +/- 0.5) respectively, representing 3\% and 0.5\% of
   surveyed habitats. Males and females used habitats similarly and short
   distances traveled between diurnal and nocturnal sites suggested that
   habitat conditions were similar across the impounded wetlands and
   shallow portions of both the Indian River and Banana River. Sedentary or
   short movements suggested that disturbance was probably negligible at
   the principal areas used by Lesser Scaup. Habitat management strategies
   for scaup should not be restricted to Merritt Island. Adjustments should
   be made to take into account that maintenance activities occur in
   adjacent estuarine areas as well.}},

Abstract = {{A mark recapture study was conducted on color-banded Roseate Terns
   (Sterna dougallii) breeding in southwestern Puerto Rico from 1991 to
   1994. The initial estimate of apparent annual survival of adults was
   62\%. After accounting for the annual rates of color-band loss (11\%)
   and permanent emigration (2-13\%), the adjusted annual survival rate
   estimate for adults ranged from 71-80\%. The estimate of pre-breeding
   survival from fledging to age three was 31\% for a cohort of chicks
   banded in 1991. The adult survival estimate is low compared to other
   seabird species, but similar to estimates derived from Roseate Terns
   breeding in the western North Atlantic. Considered together, these
   survival estimates support the hypothesis that Roseate Terns experience
   high mortality during the non-breeding season, when the ranges of the
   North American and Caribbean populations overlap. If so, management of
   this species only during the breeding season may do little to aid its
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses predict that nest defense should increase as the
   nesting cycle progresses, but the predicted pattern of increase differs.
   Previous studies of nest defense in gulls and terns have given
   conflicting results. Most of these have treated colonies as a unit, thus
   breeding asynchrony may have obscured temporal patterns. Common Tern
   (Sterna hirundo) nest defense against Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus
   marinus) was observed during two years, and responses of individuals or
   pairs of known nesting stage were recorded. Responses of terns to
   observers were also recorded. Mobbing of gulls did not increase as
   incubation progressed, contradicting parental investment models; but did
   increase as chicks aged. Chicks were defended more strongly by parents
   than were eggs. Responses to Great Black-backed Gulls were more frequent
   during the second wave of nesting, when the potential for re-nesting
   would be very low. There was no association between clutch size and nest
   defense. Aggression by terns to observers was rare during incubation,
   but became common immediately after hatching and remained frequent until
   the chicks fledged. The temporal pattern of mobbing in the
   semi-precocial Common Tern most closely resembles that predicted for
   species with altricial young. However, interpretation is complicated by
   the fact that gulls prey more frequently on chicks than eggs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated factors affecting chick provisioning by radio-tagged
   Caspian Terns (Sterna caspia) nesting in a large colony on East Sand
   Island in the Columbia River estuary during 2001. Caspian Tern predation
   on juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) in the estuary prompted
   resource managers to relocate ca. 9,000 pairs of terns nesting on Rice
   Island (river km 34) to East Sand Island (river km 8), where terns were
   expected to consume fewer salmonids in favor of marine forage fishes.
   This study investigated factors influencing foraging success, diet
   composition, and overall reproductive success at the managed Caspian
   Tern colony. Our results indicated that daytime colony attendance by
   nesting terns averaged 64\% and decreased throughout the chick-rearing
   period, while duration of foraging trips averaged 47 min and increased
   during the same period; these seasonal changes were more strongly
   related to date than chick age. Average meal delivery rates to 2-chick
   broods (0.88 meals h(-1)) were 2.6 times greater than to 1-chick broods
   (0.33 meals h(-1)). Parents delivered more juvenile salmonids to chicks
   during ebb tides than flood tides, but meal delivery rates to the nest
   remained constant, suggesting diet composition tracks relative
   availability of prey species. Foraging trips resulting in delivery of
   juvenile salmonids averaged 68\% longer than foraging trips for
   schooling marine forage fishes, indicating higher availability of marine
   prey near the colony. High availability of marine forage fish in the
   Columbia River estuary during 2001 was apparently responsible for high
   colony attendance, short foraging trips, high chick meal delivery rates,
   and high nesting success of Caspian Terns on East Sand Island.}},

Abstract = {{The prey displayed to mates and delivered to chicks by nesting
   Gull-billed Tern (Sterna nilotica) was studied in a colony on a coastal
   lagoon in eastern Spain during 2003. During 31 hours of observations,
   1,091 prey items were observed. The trophic resources exploited by the
   species and seasonal differences in prey composition within the same
   breeding season were examined. Red Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)
   was the main prey species (64\% of prey items), followed by insects
   (17\%) and fish (6\%). The proportion of terrestrial prey taken was low.
   Proportionately more aquatic prey was brought to the colony during
