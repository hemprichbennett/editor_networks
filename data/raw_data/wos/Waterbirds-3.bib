Abstract = {{Censuses of six tern species were carried out in the inlet of Lagoa dos
   Patos, southern Brazil, and on the beaches just north (along 50 km) and
   south (60 km) from this site. The Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) was the
   commonest species between October and March, with maximum abundance in
   January (14,100 individuals). Abundance peak for the South American Tern
   (Sterna hirundinacea) took place in the austral winter, with maximum
   values of 1,500 birds. Trudeau's Tern (Sterna trudeaui) and Amazon Tern
   (Sterna superciliaris) had similar seasonal patterns occurring during
   all months, with abundance peak in the non-breeding period, between
   January and July. The maximum number of Trudeau's Tern was estimated to
   be 440 birds in April and 400 in June, and that of Amazon Tern was 210
   birds in April and 230 in May. A maximum of 300 Royal Terns (Sterna
   maxima) were recorded in September, 280 in June and 280 in July, but the
   species was found in every month. The Cayenne Tern (Sterna eurygnatha)
   was also found every month, and the maximum number occurred in October
   (61 terns). All six species used the southern Brazilian coast,
   predominantly during the non-breeding season. Common, South American,
   Cayenne, and Royal Terns find their breed far north and south of the
   study area. Trudeau's Tern and the Amazon Tern breed inland in southern
   Brazil. Only the Amazon and Royal Terns showed preference for particular
   beach sub-areas, and both were found in large flocks near the Lagoa dos
   Patos inlet, the former nearer to freshwater, and the latter associated
   with discharges from the artisanal fishery. Beaches are used by Common
   Terns as roosting sites during daylight hours, and the Lagoa dos Pates
   inlet is used mostly for night roosting.}},

Abstract = {{Two separate, large-scale management units for the American White
   Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) in North America are proposed: the
   eastern and western metapopulations, separated by the North American
   Continental Divide. The populations on either side of this barrier are
   subject to contrasting ecological conditions, movement patterns suggest
   strong geographic separation and each is likely demographically
   distinct. Subdivisions within these demographic units need to be more
   precisely defined in the future. Yet, because of the highly colonial
   nesting habits of the American White Pelican, conservation can still be
   effective if directed toward separate breeding colonies. Our intent is
   to provide a compilation of current knowledge regarding species status,
   distribution and ecology. Herein, further study is recommended: (1) to
   determine genetic characteristics and the degree of genetic separation
   of the various geographic divisions in the range of the species to help
   ultimately better define ``evolutionarily significant units{''} for
   American White Pelican conservation, (2) to study movements and genetic
   exchange among and between these divisions, and (3) to study movement
   patterns and genetic mixing among these divisions during long- and
   short-term changes in environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Comments on the American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) in
   North America languished until Peter Ogden reported trapping one during
   his 1825 expedition to Utah. Brief accounts of the American White
   Pelican by ornithologists continued through the 1940s. In subsequent
   decades, scientific studies uncovered greater details of the species'
   biology and natural history although documenting numbers has been
   difficult and tentative. Estimates of numbers of adults began at 30,000
   in 1933, increased to over 100,000 by 1985, and by 1995 the total number
   of birds, then also including non-breeders, was estimated to be around
   400,000. Beginning in the 1880s, their feeding and nesting sites were
   degraded by engineered water diversions and drainage of wetlands for
   agriculture. At the same time, pelicans were shot and clubbed, and eggs
   and young were intentionally destroyed largely because the birds were
   thought to compete with humans for fish. After the 1960s, hundreds of
   pelicans died yearly due to the ingestion of insecticides such as
   toxaphene, endrin, and dieldrin. As recently as winter 1998-99, 800
   American White Pelicans died in Florida from poisoning by insecticides
   that were resuspended from flooded agricultural soils. In 1996 a disease
   pandemic at Salton Sea, California, killed over 7,500 pelicans in just
   several months. American White Pelicans have adapted to much persecution
   by simply moving. Overall, I do not believe that unusual mortalities
   have threatened their abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The only breeding colony of the American White Pelican (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos) in British Columbia is located at Stum Lake. The
   species in British Columbia. is designated ``Endangered{''} and it is
   also included on the provincial ``Red List.{''} As such, the Stum Lake
   colony has been monitored regularly since 1994, and older records of
   nest counts and pre-fledgling numbers date back as far as 1953. A
   marking program for pre-fledging American White Pelicans was conducted
   from 1968 to 1993. During recent surveys, censuses of nest depressions
   were obtained late in the breeding season; pre-fledged young were also
   enumerated. Based on nest counts, numbers at Stum Lake declined in the
   1960s and remained more or less stationary throughout the 1970s and
   early 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the number of nesting
   pairs increased dramatically; and in the past decade, numbers of
   breeding birds at Stum Lake has stabilized at the highest since
   monitoring began (1953). The mean number of pre-fledged young also shows
   an increasing trend from 1963 through 2002. The mean productivity at the
   breeding colony, however, was highest in the decade showing the largest
   growth, from 1983 to 1992; but it decreased in the past decade as total
   numbers of breeding birds continued to increase. The mean productivity
   of the breeding colony since monitoring began has been 0.62 +/- 0.37
   young nest(-1), with annual rates varying from nil to 1.48 young nest
   per nest. Four breeding failures have been documented since 1960. The
   majority of the returns from the marking program were from west of the
   Continental Divide in British Columbia, Washington, California, Oregon,
   Idaho and Mexico.}},

   since 1939. We compiled information on the history and ecology of this
   breeding colony from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) reports and
   narratives filed at Medicine Lake NWR. Nesting by American White
   Pelicans first occurred in 1939, and the recent 10-yr average size
   (19932002) is about 4,000 breeding pairs. Since 1990, the mean number of
   young fledged pair(-1) was 0.51 +/- 0.07 (SE, N = 56). Low temperatures,
   hailstorms, predation, and botulism have killed > 50\% of young pelicans
   in some years. American White Pelicans banded at Medicine Lake migrated
   south, mostly within the Central Flyway. They wintered predominately in
   Texas, Louisiana and Mexico. Protection of the Medicine Lake colony is
   important because the breeding colony is the largest in Montana and an
   important contributor to the eastern metapopulation.}},

Abstract = {{Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge currently supports the largest
   breeding colony of the American White Pelican (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos) in North America. The first written account of the
   colony's status was in 1905, when approximately 500 pelicans nested on
   two islands in Chase Lake. The colony grew to nearly 34,000 breeding
   birds by 2002. Surveys of breeding pelicans in the colony were sporadic
   from 1905 until 1972. Because the availability of foraging areas affects
   recruitment, pond counts from south-central North Dakota were used as an
   index of the relative availability of foraging areas. Pond counts varied
   widely in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1993, pond numbers increased
   dramatically, reached a peak in 1997, then declined but remained
   relatively high through 2002. Pelican numbers also increased in the mid-
   to late-1990s, possibly in response to increased and stable foraging
   opportunities. Because rising water in Chase Lake inundated the original
   nesting islands during that period, pelicans were forced to relocate
   nesting areas. Relocation provided more nesting space than the original
   islands, and nesting pelicans seemed to be gradually filling these
   areas. Threats to the Chase Lake breeding colony include disease,
   predation, and human disturbance. Research is needed to better
   understand the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of AWPE
   metapopulations and their sub-units, including factors that influence
   nest-site selection, productivity, and survival of adults and young in
   large colonies.}},

Abstract = {{The American White Pelican (Pelecanus eythrorhynchos) formerly bred the
   length of California on interior lakes and marshes of the Klamath Basin,
   Modoc Plateau and Great Basin desert of northeastern California,
   overflow lands of the Sacramento Valley, terminal lakes in the Tulare
   Basin of the San Joaquin Valley and at the Salton Sea in the Colorado
   desert. Historic data are sketchy but nesting is well documented for at
   least eleven sites. Though unknown, the number of pelicans breeding in
   the late 1800s and early 1900s may have exceeded 20,000 pairs. Decades
   of declining numbers and range retraction have left the American White
   Pelican breeding regularly in California at only two sites in the
   Klamath Basin (Sheepy Lake on Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge and
   Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge), where very vulnerable to
   catastrophic losses. Variably obtained counts at these two sites
   combined appeared to decrease from about 4,500 nests in 1912 to reach an
   equilibrium, which fluctuated around 1,600-1,700 nests from the 1950s to
   present. Annual variation is presumably a response in part to prey
   availability mediated by water levels. Several high nest counts of
   2,300-2,500 at Clear Lake since the early 1970s may partly reflect
   greater accuracy from aerial photo counts. Declines were caused by
   shooting, human disturbance and, particularly, habitat loss from water
   diversions and land reclamation for agriculture. The American White
   Pelican is currently limited in California by the availability of
   remote, undisturbed nesting sites and rich foraging habitats.
   Contaminant effects on breeding pelicans have lessened, but large
   numbers of pelicans have recently died from type C avian botulism
   outbreaks at the Salton Sea. Management and research should serve the
   protection and enhancement of breeding conditions in the Klamath Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding bird surveys were conducted at most American White Pelican
   (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) colonies in North America from 1979-81 and
   the number of American White Pelicans was estimated at > 109,000
   breeding individuals in 55 colonies. Although many pelican colonies have
   not been surveyed since the early 1980s, we present the most current
   survey numbers available for North American colonies. Using available
   data (1998-2001) and the North American Continental Divide to delineate
   eastern from western metapopulations, 27 colonies and 48,240 nests in
   the East and 15 colonies and 18,790 nests in the West were documented,
   giving a total of about 134,000 breeding pelicans in North America. The
   nest numbers of 20 eastern and western colonies that were surveyed
   during 1979-81 and again in 1998-2001 were also compared to determine if
   pelican numbers are changing. The number of AWPE nests in those colonies
   has more than doubled since the 1979-81 surveys. Because current data
   for colonies in part of the United States and much of Canada are lacking
   and about 20 years have passed since more complete surveys were done, we
   propose that regular and coordinated North American pelican surveys
   should be initiated.}},

   (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) banded between 1922 and 1981 at 77 sites in
   the U.S. and Canada was analyzed using a Geographic Information System
   (GIS). Returns showed a clear pattern of two major migratory routes,
   with birds from California, Oregon and Nevada breeding colonies
   dispersing south to the coasts of the Gulf of California and the Pacific
   coast of Mexico, and birds from central Canada, the Dakotas, Colorado,
   Minnesota and Montana following the Missouri and Mississippi River
   drainages to the Gulf of Mexico coasts, Florida and Central America.
   Pelicans banded at breeding colonies in Utah and Wyoming were recovered
   along both routes, with some evidence of a third pathway suggested for
   these birds along the western slope of the Rockies. The only region of
   substantial overlap in returns between birds banded in the western
   breeding colonies and those from mid-western breeding colonies (east of
   the North American Continental Divide) was in southern Mexico and Texas.
   Returns from Central America consisted almost exclusively of American
   White Pelicans banded in the eastern portion of the breeding range.}},

Abstract = {{Anaho Island, Pyramid Lake, Nevada supports the largest colony of the
   American White Pelican (Pplecanus erythrorhynchos) in western North
   America. Counts of adults, nests and chicks, from 1903 to the present,
   are positively correlated with flow volumes of the Truckee River in
   spring near Nixon, Nevada, 15 km from the lake. Upriver diversions of
   water have markedly reduced flows of the lower Truckee River and have
   likely depressed pelican production; for example, the Derby Dam,
   completed in 1906, diverts water from the Truckee River into the Truckee
   Canal and out of the Truckee River basin. American White Pelican
   production was negatively correlated with flows in the Truckee Canal, If
   water had remained in the river instead of being diverted, it is
   estimated that annual colony production would have averaged 8\% higher.
   A more complete model, accounting for seasonal diversions of water from
   the river between the gage upriver at Farad and the gage near Nixon,
   predicted that colony production would have averaged as much as 58\%
   higher if natural flow regimes had persisted in the Truckee River
   downriver from Farad. Human removals of water from the Truckee River,
   and thus simulated reductions on pelican colony production, were highest
   in drought years. Despite the likely reductions in production throughout
   the last century, particularly in drought years, numbers of adults and
   nests at this breeding colony demonstrated no long-term directional
   trends. Therefore, reductions in production apparently have been offset
   by higher survival or immigration from other colonies. Even so, higher
   production could be an important buffer against high mortality events,
   such as the disease die-offs of large numbers of American White Pelicans
   at Salton Sea, California, and even natural disasters described by other
   authors in this symposium.}},

   California. As a management tool, the maps can be matched to water
   surface elevation changes forecasted by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
   every year. This graphic method has allowed Klamath Basin National
   Wildlife Refuge managers to set up electrified fences at Clear Lake
   Reservoir in advance of the nesting season, successfully protecting
   nesting colonies on two recent occasions. Digital Hydrographic Maps were
   also used to match historic hydrographic records for Clear Lake
   Reservoir to examine past lake conditions and changes in nesting island
   locations, particularly when nesting failures had occurred.
   Modifications to existing nesting islands are suggested, so as to create
   more stable nesting habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern metapopulation of the American White Pelican (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos) breeds mainly in the Northern Great Plains, migrates
   through the Great Plains and along the Mississippi River and winters in
   the lower Mississippi River Valley and along the Gulf of Mexico. The
   production of farm-raised Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctalus) in the
   southeastern United States has increased dramatically in the last 25
   years. In 1990, U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services offices
   in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi began receiving complaints
   concerning the foraging of pelicans in commercial Channel Catfish ponds.
   Because of the relatively shallow depth and high fish-stocking rates
   used by most catfish producers, these ponds provide an ideal foraging
   environment for the American White Pelican. Although the impact of
   foraging pelicans can be economically significant, the potential for
   pelicans to transmit trematode infections and other diseases to
   aquaculture facilities can be more destructive. Damage abatement
   recommendations have consisted of harassment measures similar to those
   used for other piscivorous birds, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   Depredation Permits, and harassing the birds at their loafing sites.}},

Abstract = {{Records of reported die-offs of the American White Pelican (Pelicanus
   erythrorhynchos) held by the U.S. Geological Survey National Wildlife
   Health Center from 1978 through 2003 indicate that type C botulism
   (caused by Clostridium botulinum) was the major cause of mortality. In
   1996, over 15,000 birds, including 8,500 American White Pelicans, were
   estimated to have died from type C botulism at the Salton Sea in
   California. This was the largest documented die-off of any pelican
   species and was estimated to represent 15-20\% of the western
   metapopulation. This event was also notable in that it was the first
   time that fish, specifically Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), were
   implicated as the source of type C botulinum toxin for birds. Type C
   botulism has recurred in both North American species of pelicans at the
   Salton Sea every year since, although the magnitude of mortality is much
   lower. West Nile virus caused mortality in both adult and immature
   American White Pelicans, but may have a more significant impact on
   nestlings. Emaciation and mortality is common in pelican nesting
   colonies. Further clarification of the cause of nestling mortality and
   the ability to differentiate background mortality from mortality due to
   infectious disease agents such as West Nile virus and Newcastle disease
   virus would be important in determining the impact of disease in
   pelicans. Although definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, the number of
   die-offs and the estimated losses of American White Pelicans appears to
   have increased along with declines in number in western U.S.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive success of the American White Pelican (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos) was monitored at a breeding colony on Anaho Island,
   Pyramid Lake, Nevada in 1996. Eggs were collected in 1988 and 1996 and
   analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCs) and total polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs). Muscle from adults found dead or debilitated and
   euthanized, fishes from representative feeding areas and regurgitated
   fish samples from nestlings; were also analyzed for OCs and PCBs.
   Reproductive success at the breeding colony was normal in 1996 based on
   hatching rates of eggs (>= 79\% in undisturbed areas) and survival of
   nestlings. Organochlorine pesticide and PCB concentrations in eggs were
   below known effect levels on reproduction. DDE concentrations in eggs
   from Anaho Island declined between 1988 and 1996. Eggshell thickness for
   the Anaho colony was significantly lower (6\%) than the pre-OC norm, but
   the level of thinning was less than that associated with population
   declines. OCs and PCBs were seldom detected in fish.}},

Abstract = {{Culmen length has been suggested as being diagnostic for sex in the
   American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). However, the
   literature on the use of culmen length to determine sex is inconsistent,
   with reported overlap in culmen lengths for males and females ranging
   from 1 mm to > 120 mm. Morphological measurements from 188 American
   White Pelicans collected in Mississippi and Louisiana whose sex was
   determined by dissection and gonadal inspection were measured. The use
   of culmen length alone was used to determine gender for this sample by
   establishing the minimum observed culmen length for males and the
   maximum observed culmen length for females that provided the fewest
   incorrect determinations for each gender. A multivariate discriminant
   function model was developed to determine sex from our data and compared
   the diagnostic accuracy of the model with the accuracy based on culmen
   length alone. Both methods were validated using an independently
   collected sample of 22 pelicans from Florida. A culmen length of >= 310
   mm for males and <= 309 mm for females from our data correctly
   classified sex for 99\% of American White Pelicans from our Mississippi
   and Louisiana samples and 95\% of AWPE for the Florida sample. Culmen
   length and wingcord length were significant variables in the
   discriminant function model. The resulting model correctly classified
   sex of 97\% of the birds and 94\% of the independent Florida sample. The
   culmen length alone predicted the sex of American White Pelicans as well
   as multivariate methods and provides an accurate simple, non-lethal
   method for sexing the species.}},

Abstract = {{Agonistic interactions between Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) in

   and second-winter birds, and were found relatively higher in the roost,
   where they are probably the safer from human intruders. Because of the
   high proportion of adults. attacks frequently involved two adults. No
   differences were found between the frequency and success of attacks in
   relation to the age of the birds arriving to the roost, perhaps
   indicating that pre-attack display represented an efficient form of
   agonistic communication. The number of attacks was not correlated with
   the number of cormorants; in the roost. probably due to a constant

Abstract = {{The diving patterns of the Antarctic Shag (Phalacrocorax
   bransfieldensis) there studied by direct observation on individuals
   foraging at Harmony Cove, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, during
   the 1995/96 and 1996/97 breeding seasons. The individuals observed
   foraged in shallow waters, mainly solitarily and presumably dived
   aerobically. The shags displayed relatively short diving bouts composed
   of few dives. During the 1995/96 breeding season, the duration of the
   dives decreased with the increase in the number of dives per bout and
   increased with the diving depth. These relationships were not
   statistically significant in 1996/97. In both seasons, the duration of
   the dives was positively related with both the surface resting time
   preceding and succeeding the dive, which may indicate that these birds
   display anticipatory or reactive dives probably according to the
   foraging conditions. Shags at the surface were seen swallowing fish
   longer than 15 cm; smaller fish as well as invertebrates may have been
   ingested underwater. The mean diving efficiencies of the bouts fall
   within the range reported for phalacrocoracids, but values of diving
   efficiency below unity were observed.}},

Abstract = {{During 1980-2002, the distribution of nesting and brood-rearing Snow
   Geese of the subspecies (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in the
   Sagavanirktok River delta study area, Alaska, were documented during
   monitoring programs for the Endicott oilfield. Densities for Snow Goose
   nests on Howe Island were estimated based on mid- to late June aerial
   photographic surveys. Brood-rearing flocks and total geese were based on
   late July to early-August aerial survey or banding locations. The
   highest nesting density was mid-island; Snow Geese shifted their nesting
   distribution away from a den site when Arctic Foxes (Alopex lagopus)
   were present on the island. Most Snow Geese that rear broods in the
   Sagavanirktok River delta study area nested on Howe Island.
   Brood-rearing Snow Geese expanded their dispersal range with increasing
   numbers of total adult geese. The movement of brood-rearing Snow Geese
   to coastal salt marsh sites up to 35 km from Howe Island and movements
   into non-saline habitats along the west channel of the Sagavanirktok
   River suggest that the salt marsh resources in the Sagavanirktok River
   delta may not be able to support more than 500 Snow Geese.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus
   magellauicus), including the timing of laying, brooding and fledging,
   foraging trip lengths during incubation and brooding and diet in
   relation to breeding success, was investigated at Volunteer Beach in the
   north east of the Falkland Islands during the 2001/02 breeding season.
   Egg-laying dates were between 12 October and 1 November, with an overall
   hatching success of 65\%. The length of foraging trips during incubation
   ranged from 2-15 days. Chicks were provisioned daily during the 23 day
   brood period, and then at a mean interval of two days during the
   unattended period, until fledging occurred in late January and early
   February. Successful pairs laid significantly earlier and undertook
   shorter foraging trips during incubation and brooding compared to
   unsuccessful pairs. The mean breeding success of 0.2 chicks/pair was low
   compared to the ten year mean at the study site and was possibly due to
   a lower abundance of squid, which is the preferred food for Magellanic
   penguin chicks in the Falkland Islands. The results obtained are
   discussed with regard to the breeding biology of the Magellanic Penguin
   on the mainland of South America. However, further research in
   subsequent seasons is required to determine whether the observed
   differences in breeding biology compared to elsewhere in the species
   range is typical behavior or the result of the changed prey
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{The Red Phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) is a rare species in west
   Greenland, where it generally breeds on islands in association with the
   Arctic Tern (Sterna, paradisaea). The strength of this association was
   confirmed on the archipelago of Gronne Ejland, the largest tern colony
   in Greenland, where Arctic Terns inhabited all four major islands until
   15 years ago, but now have abandoned two of them; the Red Phalarope left
   the same two islands after a few years, but not the islands still
   inhabited by terns. The terns apparently disappeared from the two
   islands due to the presence of Arctic Foxes (Alopex lagopus) over
   several years. The disappearance of the Red Phalarope could have been a
   response to the absence of breeding terns, or could have happened as a
   direct result of predation and disturbance from foxes. The Red-necked
   Phalarope (P. lobatus), however, still breeds on the islands abandoned
   by the terns. It might be that the Red Phalarope is snore vulnerable to
   fox predation than the Red-necked Phalarope, which may partly explain
   why the former of the two species in west Greenland breeds only in tern
   colonies on islands, whereas the latter is widely distributed, including
   inland areas.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed data on numbers and annual trends of breeding terns and
   galls based on censuses of all colonies of the Caspian Tern (Sterna
   caspia). Forster's Tern (S. forsteri) and California Gall (Larus
   californicus) in the San Francisco Bay estuary front 1982 to 2003. All
   species used nesting substrate. that were flat, largely non-vegetated,
   had a tide view in all directions, and were composed of sand, gravel. or
   earth. The estuary supported 17. 13, and seven colonies of each species,
   respectively. Nesting terns were primarily on salt evaporation pond
   islands and tidal islands. The largest colony of California Gulls teas
   on a deactivated salt pond. Total numbers of each species in 2003 were
   about 2,300, 2,400 and 21,200 breeding birds. respectively. Numbers of
   Forster's Tents declined significantly dining the study. while
   California Gulls increased. and the number of Caspian Tents was stable.
   Numbers of each species at each colony site have shown considerable
   anneal variation. We attribute the lack; of colony site fidelity of each
   species, and the decline among Forster's Terns, primarily to mammalian
   predation, human disturbance, and possibly annual vitiation in food
   availability. Flat, minimally vegetated islands, which are few. in the
   estuary. are critical for maintaining nesting terns and California
   Gulls. Yet, the planned restoration of 65\% (9,050 ha) of the salt pond
   complex of the Sail Francisco Bay estuary will likely remove some of the
   salt pond islands and levees where 20\% of the Caspian Terns (438
   birds). 80\% of Forster's Terns (1,958) and 96\% of California Gull
   (20,210) were nesting in 2003. We recommend that restoration plans
   should include the creation of sizeable tracts of islands specifically
   designed to provide nesting habitat for these larids. These replacement
   sites should be in place soon after the restoration has been
   implemented; i.e.. well before scheduled completion. This is especially
   important because severe habitat limitation would lead to competition
   for nesting space among the three species, a situation expected to
   result in exclusion of the terns by the grill, which nests earlier, are
   larger, more abundant, and more aggressive.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the reproductive performance of the Common Tern (Sterna
   hirundo) from 1991-2002 at four restored colonies in Maine that differ
   in location (inshore, nearshore and offshore sites), colony age and size
   and predation. Specifically, phenology, clutch size, survival, growth,
   provisioning rates and predation intensity and frequency were compared
   between sites. Common Terns nesting on the two inshore islands laid
   larger clutches, hatched chicks earlier that grew faster, reached a
   greater asymptotic mass, and had a greater chance of fledging than
   conspecifics on a nearshore and an offshore colony, despite greater
   predation pressure. Individuals nesting at the offshore site suffered
   reduced reproductive performance, which may be due to colony location
   with respect to foraging areas. Clutch size, chick provisioning rates
   and first hatch dates (earlier) declined as colony size increased.
   Although inshore nesting terns produced more chicks on average,
   extensive predation in some years caused high breeding failure,
   resulting in a ``boom or bust{''} productivity situation for these
   islands. Differences in predation and performance between inshore,
   nearshore and offshore islands have important implications for the
   restoration, conservation and management of terns in this region.
   Nearshore sites offer the best restoration potential and should be
   strongly considered when available.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of the biology of the Little Tern (Sterna albifrons) were
   studied at the Ebro Delta (northwestern Mediterranean) during 1996-1997.
   including colony site selection, clutch size and egg size. Using a
   single visit to avoid disturbances, average number of eggs was 2.62 eggs
   per nest, and was significantly larger in 1996 than in 1997, when the
   modal clutch size was only two eggs. Mean egg volume was 8.88 cm(3) (SD
   +/- 0.57), and mean egg size in a clutch (for both two- and three-egg
   clutches) was also significantly larger in 1996 than in 1997.
   Furthermore, average egg volume in three-egg clutches (clutches that
   were probably completed) was significantly different among the four main
   breeding areas within the delta. Clutch size was not significantly
   different among breeding areas in either year. Little Terns bred
   associated with other colonial Charadriiforms more than in other
   Mediterranean breeding areas. The terns associated with all the
   commonest colonial species of shorebirds, but never associated with the
   Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis), Audouin's Gull (L. audouinii) or
   Black-headed Gull (L. ridibundus). The number of breeding pairs
   decreased from 625 in 1961 to 332 in 2003, this decline occurring mainly
   since the early 1990s. Mean population declined significantly by 2\% per
   year for the whole period. During the last decade, the number of
   breeding areas has increased from four to nine, despite the decrease in
   breeding numbers (rate of decrease 7.1\% per year). Nothing is known
   about the factors driving this decrease, but changes are probably linked
   to processes in other colonies at a metapopulation level.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of regular wintering of the White Stork (Ciconia
   ciconia) in southern France ha been documented by regular census data
   and individual identification of banded birds. The number of wintering
   storks rose from eight in 1996-1997 to 172 in 2003-2004. Most records
   (87\%) came from the Montpellier region (43degrees34'N, 3degrees54'E).
   The birds mainly originated from western Germany. eastern France and
   western Switzerland and about half were probably immature. Compared to
   storks observed on autumn and spring migration. first-winter birds were
   under-represented. We discuss the factors likely to explain the
   settlement of this new wintering area: its location on the migration
   route of the increasing northwest European stork population, the
   presence of a rubbish dump and adverse effects of wintering in Africa.}},

   analyzed for the richness and distribution of the dabbling and diving
   waterbirds in a wetland complex with 26 ponds (0.1-88.6 ha) in southeast
   Spain. These environments are being lost on a global scale through human
   activity. Morphological, geographical, hydrochemical, vegetative and
   temporal parameters of the ponds (11 in total), as well as
   characteristics of the species, were sampled to identify those variables
   with the capacity to predict the effects provoked by the habitat
   configuration. The function of the size and the isolation, as variables
   related to the habitat patchiness, as well as the development of the
   emergent vegetation of the wetlands were discriminated as forecasters of
   number of species. The avian abundance had an important role in the
   capacity of the birds to occupy ponds (sampling hypothesis). The
   differences in the abundance of species probably favored their orderly
   loss from the wetland complex at the same rate as the ponds diminished
   in size ({''}nested{''} pattern). The results obtained imply the need
   for the conservation or restoration of numbers of wetlands, paying
   special attention to the largest, with peripheral vegetation cover
   around large, open water bodies in complexes with more than one pond, to
   preserve the greatest number of species against the loss of wetlands
   which is occurring worldwide and is a cause of biodiversity decline.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) and Great Egret (Ardea alba)
   nested in eight colonies along the Upper Mississippi River, USA, and
   individual birds were followed by airplane to feeding sites during the
   nesting seasons in 1995-1998. Both species used braided
   channel/backwater habitats for feeding more than expected, based on
   availability, and open pool and main navigation channel less than
   expected. Most individuals of both species fed <5 km from their breeding
   colony and avoided sites >10 km away. Habitat and distance need to be
   considered simultaneously when assessing habitat quality for herons and
   egrets. The Great Blue Heron flew farther to feeding sites during the
   care-of-young period than during incubation and the Great Egret showed
   the opposite pattern. The Great Blue Heron tended to feed solitarily;
   only 10\% of the feeding flights ended at a location where another heron
   was already present. About one-third of Great Egret feeding flights
   ended at a location with another egret already present. Colony placement
   on the landscape seemed to be a function of the feeding radius of each
   colony.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial harvests of the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) and King
   Eider (S. spectabilis) was studied at the local market in Nuuk
   (southwest Greenland) during the hunting season (Oct-May) in 2000 and
   2001. The goal was to quantify composition (species, sex and age),
   sources (hunting or bycatch), and spatio-temporal distribution of the
   harvest. Hunting within 30 km of the city was the source of 98\% of all
   eiders sent to market from October until March. In contrast, bycatch in
   gillnets accounted for 52\% of the eiders brought to the market in March
   and April. In April, most bycatch were from remote fjord habitat;. which
   seem to hold a high proportion of adult Common Eiders. As measured by
   the removal of potential reproductive eiders, the spring harvest (April
   and May) was critical for the Common Eider, while the impact of harvest
   was highest during midwinter (January and February) for the King Eider.
   Sympatric distributions within hunting areas complicate management of
   both specie. Spring hunting and gillnet bycatch are of high management
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{When studying breeding dispersal with marked individuals,
   manipulation-induced disturbance should not affect movement patterns. As
   part of a study on the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), we tested
   whether the capture of breeding adults at their nest and handling (i.e.,
   disturbance) increased their probability to move to a new colony in the
   subsequent breeding season (i.e., breeding dispersal). The proportion of
   adults disturbed in a given year that had changed colony in the
   subsequent breeding season was compared with the dispersal of adults
   observed during at least two consecutive years at colonies and not
   disturbed on the previous year: (1) birds marked as chicks and (2) birds
   marked as adults and observed ? two years after capture at the nest.
   Disturbed birds were not found to have an increased propensity to
   disperse. We conclude that, for this species, capture did not increase
   the subsequent breeding dispersal.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The Ivory Gull (Pagophila eburnea) has a circumpolar breeding
   distribution and spends the entire year at high latitudes in the Arctic
   and North Atlantic oceans. Due to its remote breeding locations and
   nomadic wintering habits, little detailed information on the ecology of
   this species exists, and no estimates of survival rate are available.
   Recent surveys have shown a dramatic decline, with an estimated 250-350
   pairs now breeding in Canada. Across its range, the Ivory Gull was
   traditionally harvested by northern communities, and, although now
   protected, it is still shot in some regions. Ivory Gulls were banded in
   the Canadian Arctic (N = 1,526) in the 1970s and early 1980s. Most
   recoveries (N = 17) came from birds shot in northwest Greenland, while
   five birds were shot in Canada. As yet, no birds banded at more
   southerly locations have been recovered. Annual adult survival rate of
   0.86 +/- 0.04 and reporting rate of 0.03 +/- 0.009 were calculated for
   birds banded at Grise Fjord and Seymour Island. The higher recovery
   rates of Ivory Gulls banded in northern areas suggests that hunting
   could have an impact on their already small population. Education
   programs to prevent further hunting of the species are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the diet of the Red Knot (Calidris canutus) at
   Punta Rasa: the southern extreme of the Ramsar Site at Bahia
   Samborombon. in the Buenos.-fires pi-mince, Argentina. Data presented
   here are mostly based on fecal analysis. We also used gizzard content
   analyses of four casualties that occurred during the catching
   operations. Remains of prey occurred in all droppings and consisted
   entirely of shell fragments of the Mud Snail (Littoridina australis,
   Hydrobiidae: Mesogasteropoda). A total of 295 droppings were analyzed
   containing Mud Snail fragments from which the size distribution of
   ingested L. australis could be estimated using a regression equation
   derived from a reference collection. In both study years (1995 and
   2000), the size distribution of ingested Mud Snails differed
   significantly from size distribution present in the habitat: however.
   average length of ingested Mud Snails was similar in both periods. Three
   of the four gizzards analyzed contained Mud Snails. The fourth contained
   a common Scarabaeidae beetle (Dyscinetus sp., Coleoptera) present in the
   area in autumn. Re-stilts support the hypothesis that the Red Knot has a
   specialized diet and select medium-late size food items.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive success of the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus)
   nesting on beaches in central Monterey Bay, California, was monitored
   before (1984 to 1990) and during (1991 to 1999) predator management.
   From 1984 to 1990, hatching success of the Snowy Plover declined from
   66\% to 26\% and most nest loss was attributed to Red Fox (Vulpes
   vulpes) predation. From 1991 to 1999, exclosures were used to protect
   some nests and after 1993, mammalian nest predators were removed.
   Predator management increased hatching success and the number of chicks
   hatched per male, but not fledging success or the number of chicks
   fledged per male. Predation of chicks by avian predators probably
   limited fledging success. The number of breeding adults did not increase
   and incubating adults were subject to greater mortality when nesting in
   exclosures. Our results indicate that exclosures are useful for
   increasing hatching success, but we caution that widespread use of
   exclosures may increase adult mortality rates and contribute to a
   decline in breeding numbers.}},

Abstract = {{The intertidal area of Fracasso beach at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina is
   used as a regular stop-over site by the Two-Banded Plover (Charadrius
   falklandicus), a neotropical Patagonian species. We analyzed the feeding
   patterns and diet choice of the Two-banded Plover at Fracasso beach
   based on fecal analyses and measurements of the intertidal invertebrate
   community. The intertidal area was divided in six zones related to the
   tide height. Two-banded Plovers are visual foragers that use
   stop-run-stop as strategy to capture their prey, and invested the bulk
   of their foraging time in the medium to high shore zones. The most
   frequent prey found in the droppings was the bivalve mollusk Darina
   solenoides, the only clam eaten, but when frequency was converted to
   biomass, the contribution to the diet of the polychaete Glycera
   americana, one of the three polychaete species eaten, was 15 times
   higher than the contribution of bivalve mollusk Darina solenoides.
   Two-banded Plovers selected very small clams compared with the large
   polychaetes consumed.}},

Abstract = {{The conditions that determine habitat suitability for waterbirds on
   temporary wetlands in Australia are poorly understood. This study
   describes the foraging behavior of the Black-fronted Plover (Elseyornis
   melanops) on two shallow saline lagoons with variable water depths. When
   water levels were receding, areas were left exposed around the periphery
   of the lagoons, which formed a succession from substrates still covered
   by water, to wet mild with a surface layer of water, to moist firm mud
   and eventually to dry, hard mud. The plovers showed a strong preference
   for feeding in areas of moist, firm mud and their prey capture rates
   were highest in this substrate type. When water levels rose following
   rainfall, previously exposed areas were partially flooded and the birds'
   prey capture rates fell significantly. Most abandoned the lagoon. The
   species was thus highly dependent on receding water levels to provide
   suitable foraging conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) in three marshes
   located in southeastern James Bay, Canada, in order to document the
   status and distribution of this species at risk. Night-surveys of
   calling males were made along 75 kin of line transect on 21-25 July
   2002, and 186 individual Yellow Rails were recorded: 80 in Cabbage
   Willows Bay, 77 in Boatswain Bay, and 29 in Hall Cove. Daytime surveys
   yielded 19 additional calling males, giving a total of 205 male rails.
   Transects were distributed in plant communities dominated by Slimstem
   Reedgrass (Calamagrostis stricia), Chaffy Sedge (Carex paleacea),
   Buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), or by Red Fescue (Festuca rubra).
   There was an overall density of 0.05 calling rails per ha with maximum
   densities in Boatswain Bay (0.08 male/ ha) and Hall Cove (0.06
   males/ha). Densities calculated for specific plant communities permitted
   an estimate of 397 male Yellow Rail inhabiting the marshes: 216 in
   Boatswain Bay, 132 in Cabbage Willows Bay, and 49 in Hall Cove. The
   highest densities were in Chaffy Sedge stands, Slimstem Reedgrass
   stands, and fens dominated by Buckbean. This study indicates that the
   Yellow Rail is a common bird in coastal high-marshes of the southeastern
   James Bay, and revealed the highest densities ever reported for the
   species. The extensive estuarine tidal marshes found in southern James
   Bay may be home of a thousand or more adult male Yellow Rails and thus
   represents a key area for this species.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys were conducted at 35 Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) colonies
   in urban and rural landscapes of south-coastal British Columbia, Canada,
   to investigate low nesting productivity during 1998 and 1999 compared to
   a decade ago. Nesting failure was common (59\% of 1,247 nests) and
   widespread (in 90\% of 31 colonies) and accounted for 96\% of the
   variation in nesting productivity among colonies in 1999. Nesting
   failure was more frequent in small colonies (<50 nests) than in large
   colonies greater than or equal to50 nests). Human disturbance has
   probably increased due to growth in the human population in the region,
   and direct disturbance front the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
   was more frequent in 1999 than a decade earlier. Eagles predated eggs,
   nestlings, and fledglings and were probably responsible for most of the
   observed nesting failure. Direct disturbance by humans was infrequent,
   but heron nesting productivity was negatively correlated with the
   frequency of human pedestrians near colonies. We suggest that Great Blue
   Heron breeding failure was more frequent in 1998 and 1999 compared to a
   decade ago because of the combined effects of human disturbance from
   land development and an increased frequency of eagle predation.}},

   in approximately 25\% of the nests at two of three heronries (Kiersity
   and Katy Rybackie; north Poland) studied in 2000-2002. Pecking (mostly
   at the youngest chick) was the commonest type of aggressive behavior
   (over 60\% of cases). The chick mortality rate was higher in nests with
   sibling aggression than in other nests, however significant differences
   were found only at Katy Rybackie. Foraging of parent birds nearby, in an
   area with abundant high quality and easily caught prey, could have
   caused the lack of sibling aggression in the colony at Mosty. At Katy
   Rybackie, many chicks died in nests where aggressive behavior had been
   noted. It appears that siblicide, not predation, is the most important
   factor affecting Grey Heron breeding success in these colonies.}},

Abstract = {{The fish community of the Gulf of Puck in the Baltic Sea has changed in
   recent years following the successful introduction of the Round Goby
   (Neogobius melanostomus). The first specimen of Round Goby was caught in
   1990 and now is estimated in millions of individuals. The Round Goby was
   a main component of the Grey Heron diet in the colony at Mosty and made
   up 95\% of regurgitated prey items. During chick rearing period, herons
   mostly flew to the coast to forage in shallow waters and feed on the
   Round Goby. The numbers of Grey Herons at Mosty have increased recently,
   especially since 1999 (from 238 in 1999 to 493 nests in 2003; an
   increase of 107\%). The indirect evidence suggests that the rapid
   expansion of the Round Goby has influenced the Grey Heron and affected
   both the diet and the numbers of birds feeding and breeding in the
   vicinity of the Puck Gulf.}},

   departed from the colony and fed young only at night. The characteristic
   ``Gr{''} call, which was recorded and analyzed, was used a contact-call,
   which ceased on disturbance. Timing of nesting was highly asynchronous.
   Nests were over water and in deep shade. Adults shaded young from the

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We examined sexual size dimorphism of Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea)
   from a breeding colony in northeastern North America. Each bird was
   sexed using DNA extracted from feather pulp. Body morphometrics recorded
   included mass, natural wing chord, head-bill, tail fork, culmen, depth
   of bill at the gonys, and tarsus. Two discriminant functions identified
   head-bill and bill depth as the best measurements to identify the sexes.
   The first function included head-bill only and correctly classified 73\%
   of our sample. The second function included both head-bill and bill
   depth, correctly classified 74\% of our sample and increased the ability
   to correctly sex individuals within a pair. We provide a method for
   researchers to calculate the probability of sexing Arctic Terns. This is
   done by fitting a non-linear equation through a plot of the probability
   of classifying an individual and the discriminant scores. Male Arctic
   Terns were generally larger in head-bill and bill depth than female
   Arctic Terns; however, we did not find evidence for assortative mating.
   With some species, morphometrics alone can be used to distinguish the
   sexes but for species such as Arctic Terns, which have a high degree of
   overlap between the sexes, it is recommended that a combination of
   morphometrics and genetic analysis is used to obtain the highest
   accuracy in sexing individuals correctly. Comparison of the
   morphometrics of northeastern North American and British populations of
   Arctic Terns suggests that these discriminant functions can be applied
   to both.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, we compared demographic and biological parameters in Common
   Terns (Sterna hirundo) among three colonies located 10-26 km apart in
   Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA. The three colony sites differed
   primarily in size, number of pairs, and length of occupancy by terns:
   Penikese Island (8 ha, 132 pairs, 3 yr), Ram Island (1.1 ha, 1,900
   pairs, 8 yr), Bird Island (0.6 ha, 1,800 pairs, >65 yr). This study
   compared parental ages and origins, nesting phenology, clutch-size,
   chick growth rates, productivity, chick diets, feeding rates and
   foraging trip times among the three colonies. Common Terns breeding at
   the new colony on Penikese Island were significantly younger (mean age
   6.8 yr) and laid later (mean laying date 25 May), had higher
   productivity (2.2 fledged chicks/ pair) and higher chick growth rates
   than those at the old colony on Bird Island (means 11.7 yr, 20 May, 0.8
   chicks/ pair, respectively). Feeding rates were highest and foraging
   trip times for all types of prey were shortest at Penikese Island. Birds
   at Ram Island were intermediate in all these respects. Although
   productivity of Common Terns at Bird Island was relatively low during
   the period in which the other two colonies were established (1992-1999),
   both breeding adults at Bird Island and chicks raised there have been
   very slow to move to the other colonies, which were colonized mainly by
   immigrants from outside the region.}},

Abstract = {{We studied relationships among sediment variables (carbon content, C:N,
   hardness, oxygen penetration, silt-clay fraction), hydrologic variables
   (dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, transparency, water depth),
   sizes and biomass of common invertebrate classes, and densities of 15
   common waterbird species in ponds of impounded freshwater, oligohaline,
   mesohaline, and unimpounded mesohaline marshes during winters 1997-98 to
   1999-2000 on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, USA.
   Canonical correspondence analysis and forward selection was used to
   analyze the above variables. Water depth and oxygen penetration were the
   variables that best segregated habitat characteristics that resulted in
   maximum densities of common waterbird species. Most common waterbird
   species were associated with specific marsh types, except Green-winged
   Teal (Anas crecca) and Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeala). We concluded
   that hydrologic manipulation of marsh ponds is the best way to manage
   habitats for these birds, if the hydrology can be controlled adequately.}},

Abstract = {{There is little information on the status and trends of the Black-legged
   Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) colonies in Greenland. This study analyses
   and evaluates historical counts from 1920-1999 of kittiwake colonies
   that have had greater than or equal to1,000 breeding pairs and have been
   counted at least twice. Fifty colonies fulfilled these criteria.
   Thirty-four of these colonies declined by between 50-100\%. Data suggest
   that the decline has occurred throughout most of the country. Only five
   colonies had increased and eleven had remained stable or fluctuated with
   no clear trend. The increasing colonies do not compensate for the
   overall decline. Despite the heterogeneity of the count years and
   varying degree of count quality, the data suggest a dramatic decline
   within the last century. Data analysis does not suggest that local
   hunting, egg collecting or disturbance at the breeding colonies have
   been major causes for the decline and other causes should be considered.
   Causes of the decline remain unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Bird use of three created salt marsh islands, constructed from dredged
   material near the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas, USA, was
   compared with that of natural marsh to provide feedback prior to
   additional marsh construction. Habitat associations of four bird groups
   (shorebirds, perching birds, wading birds, and gulls and terns) were
   similar in all sites, but relative contributions of each group to total
   avian abundance differed. Differences in site-use by birds were largely
   explained by differences in ratios of available habitat types, which
   were products of their geomorphic designs. Created marsh designs
   differed substantially from the natural marsh, where the unvegetated
   exposed-substrate and shallow-water habitats preferred by waterbirds
   were prominent features. The oldest created site (four years old)
   differed most from the natural marsh. Intertidal areas in the site were
   almost completely overgrown by vegetation, resulting in dominance of the
   avian assemblage by perching birds (especially grackles, Quiscalus spp.)
   rather than waterbirds. In the newer created sites (two years old),
   where vegetation had not completely overgrown the intertidal areas,
   avian assemblages were more typical of the natural marsh. However,
   vegetation cover was expanding in these sites, causing a reduction in
   waterbird habitat area. Efforts to ensure availability of unvegetated
   habitat in created sites will improve their structural similarity to
   natural marsh in the study area, and will likely increase their
   functional similarity for avian species.}},

Abstract = {{Within-season nest persistence of large wading bird (Ciconiiformes)
   rookeries in the Atchafalaya Delta, Louisiana was examined during 1994
   and 1995. A sample of rookery trees was permanently marked, and the
   status of 7,864 nests of ten species was followed through time. Nest
   construction began in early March, and some rookeries were still active
   into September during both seasons. Uniform nest persistence rates were
   calculated for each 28-day time period throughout the nesting season.
   Nest persistence rates per 28 days ranged from 0.00-0.96. During both
   years the rates tended to be lowest during the early season and
   increased into the late season. In 1994, nest persistence rates were
   significantly different, caused by the interaction of season and late
   nesting of White Ibis. In 1995, nest persistence rates differed
   significantly by season. The results call into question the value of
   nest counts obtained by one visit to a rookery complex, as these may
   greatly underestimate the numbers of breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{While Isla Chanaral (29degrees02'S) in Chile has long been recognized as
   one of the most important breeding islands for the Humboldt Penguin, the
   reported numbers of birds there never exceeded 3,500 breeding
   individuals in the last two decades. However, in 2002, a one-day survey
   found considerably more penguins present on Isla Chanaral, which exceed
   the world population estimate for the species (3,300-12,000 birds).
   Between 9 and 14 February 2003 we conducted a census of the Humboldt
   Penguin on Isla Chanaral. Two different survey methods were combined to
   assess the number of penguins. Terrestrial or surface counts were used
   to survey penguins on open plains or beaches. Small area surveys of
   randomly established quadrats were conducted to assess the density of
   penguins in nests and the total number of nest sites. Results from small
   area surveys were extrapolated using surface size ratios of counting
   quadrats vs. entire nesting sectors. We determined that approximately
   22,000 adult Humboldt Penguins, 3,600 chicks and 117 juveniles were
   present on the island during the survey. The results were much higher
   than any previously published estimate. Natural processes alone cannot
   account for an increase, and penguin numbers on Isla Chanaral previously
   have been underestimated. The results correspond well with recent
   publications that suggest that Humboldt Penguin numbers in Chile have
   been underestimated in the past due to inappropriate or inconsistent
   census methods. There are concerns about the current protection status
   of the island in light of its fragility and importance as the premier
   breeding location of the Humboldt Penguin along its entire
   distributional range.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{129-134}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) uses habitats that are
   intertidal or within 2-3 km from tidal areas for feeding and loafing.
   Habitats used for feeding are water bodies containing fish and shrimps
   and a relatively wide zone of shallow water with a depth ranging between
   6 and 21 cm. The bottom consisted of fine sediments with no or little
   vegetation or other obstructions such as stones, twigs, branches and
   roots of trees, wide and deep channels, or debris. They have a
   preference for highly turbid water, but seemed indifferent to salinity,
   which was varied between 0parts per thousand and 48parts per thousand.
   Such sites are found on flooded intertidal mudflats, and also in tidal
   lagoons, brackish pools, fishponds, and gei wai (traditional ponds for
   shrimp farming in mangrove areas). Feeding habitats have to contain
   suitable food and also be relatively safe. In contrast with the
   requirements for their feeding habitats, the choice of loafing areas is
   extensive, and includes places of relative safety: undisturbed, with an
   open view for early discovery of predators in time and the possibility
   of easy escape. Shallow ( < 15 cm) water is necessary for bathing. They
   loaf in water of a depth of 0-15 cm and also on land, in trees and on
   human-made structures. Habitat characters, other than water, are
   subordinate to those of safety. The difference in requirements is
   evident in narrow channels between high and dense vegetation where
   Black-faced Spoonbills feed, but where they never loaf.}},

   the Gulf of Khambhat (80\%). 99.6\% of the Greater Flamingos were found
   in wetlands near the coast, with only 0.4\% on inland freshwater
   wetlands. The Lesser Flamingos were exclusively found on the coastal
   wetlands. In coastal wetlands, both species showed clear habitat
   preference: 82\% of Greater Flamingos were distributed in saltpans and
   77\% of Lesser Flamingos were on coastal mudflats.}},

Abstract = {{Concomitant with increasing numbers of the Double-crested Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax auritus), catfish producers in eastern Mississippi and
   western Alabama have reported damage caused by cormorant predation. VHF
   telemetry was used to document movements of 25 cormorants from all known
   night roosts in the aquaculture producing areas of eastern Mississippi
   and western Alabama, January-April 1998. A total of 193 day locations
   and 396 night roost locations of the cormorants were obtained. Each
   cormorant was found in the study area for 57 +/- 4 (SE) days. Each
   cormorant averaged three night roosts (range: 1-8) and spent 20 (+/-2)
   days at each night roost site. Over 95\% of cormorant day locations were
   within 19 km oftheir night roosts. Catfish pond use by cormorants varied
   between roost sites. Cormorants from five of eleven night roosts had
   greater than or equal to 30\% of subsequent daytime locations on catfish
   ponds and birds from five of tire six remaining night roosts did not
   visit catfish ponds on the following day. Foraging distance and
   frequency of night roost interchange was less for birds in this study
   than those reported from other aquaculture regions. We Suggest roost
   harassment efforts should be Focused on specific roost sites and some
   roost sites should serve as unharrassed refugia front which cormorants
   are less likely to cause damage to aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding colony of the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary has grown
   dramatically over the last 13 years, in contrast to declines at other
   colonies along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Immigration from
   other colonies has Occurred and the East Sand Island colony is now the
   largest for the species on the Pacific coast of North America. Despite
   substantial increases in the size of the East Sand Island colony,
   overall numbers of the West C oast subspecies (P. a. albociliatus)
   appear to be slowly increasing relative to the interior Population (P.
   a. auritus). Based on the most recent regional population data
   available, a conservative estimate indicates that the colony on East
   Sand Island represents over 30\% of P. a. albociliatus breeding adults.
   We advocate that the subspecies P. a. albociliatus be considered a
   distinct population segment and managed according to overall Population
   size and trends for this subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) diet was Studied during three
   years (2001-2003) in an area where Arctic Kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) is
   extensively distributed off the central Norwegian coast. A total of 608
   diet samples, 378 (62.2\%) chick regurgitations, 22 (3.6\%) whole fish,
   and 208 (34.2\%) pellets were collected from the colonies at regular
   intervals during the chick-rearing period. From these samples a total of
   1,013 food items (after pairing the otoliths) were isolated,
   representing 18 fish species. Gadoids, mainly Cod (Gadus morhua) and
   Saithe (Pollachius virens) dominated the diet (75\% numerically, 86\% by
   biomass). During the first year of the Study, Cod represented nearly
   50\% of the diet, but decreased to 13\% in 2003. At the same time, the
   occurrence of Saithe in the diet increased from 23\% to 65\%. For Saithe
   age II-group fish dominated the diet in 2001, and I- and II- group
   dominated in 2002 and 2003. For Cod 0-group fish dominated the diet in
   2001 and 0- and I-group fish dominated in 2002 and 2003. The decrease in
   Cod in the diet of the Great Cormorant most probably reflected the
   decrease in the Norwegian coastal Cod population, and that the increase
   in Saithe in the diet is related to the relative increase in the
   abundance of this fish prey as the abundance of Cod decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Diets were examined and analyzed for 418 wintering Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected from January to mid-April
   2061 and October to December 2001 at an oxbow lake in southeast
   Arkansas. The fish community was also sampled to examine prey
   availability. Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Yellow Bass (Morone
   mississippiensis) were the most important species in cormorant diet.
   Other, less important, cormorant prey species included Channel Catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus), cyprinids (minnows), and sunfishes (Lepomis
   spp.). Diet varied by season and sex. Cormorants consumed higher
   proportions of cyprinids and Channel Catfish in the autumn than the
   remainder of the over-wintering period. In general, females consumed
   Gizzard Shad more than males, while males consumed Channel Catfish more
   than females. Neither genders consumed notable amounts of sport fish.
   Prey size did not differ between the sexes, but did vary by season.
   These data demonstrate the relative importance of forage and rough fish
   and the lesser relative importance of sport fish in the diet of
   cormorants over-wintering on an oxbow lake ill Southeast Arkansas.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about wetland selection by Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis)
   during any phase of the breeding cycle, particularly in the northern
   boreal forest region, where most of the North American population of
   scaup breeds. We used survey data (1989-98) for 402 wetlands near
   Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada to assess frequency of scaup
   brood occurrence. In 1999, features of 80 randomly selected wetlands (21
   used and 59 not used by scaup broods) and 27 wetlands used repeatedly by
   brood-rearing scaup were evaluated (N = 107 total). Discriminant
   function analysis using all wetland measurements was used to classify
   scaup use of 77 randomly selected wetlands; classification criteria were
   subsequently used to predict brood use of the remaining 30 hold-out
   wetlands. This randomization procedure was repeated 100 times, producing
   an average classification success of 88\% (95\% CI = 77\% to 97\%).
   Broods occurred more often on larger, deeper wetlands with water lilies
   and amphipod crustaceans, the latter being an important food for adults
   and ducklings. Wetlands created during road construction were used less
   often, possibly because these tended to be smaller, shallow, less likely
   to have amphipods, and had a different vegetation regime than natural
   wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{The 24-hour habitat use and home range of the Laysan Teal (Anas
   laysanensis), an endemic dabbling duck in Hawaii, was studied using
   radio telemetry during 1998-2000. Radios were retained for a mean of 40
   days (0123 d; 73 adult birds radio-tagged). Comparisons of daily habitat
   use were made for birds in the morning, day, evening, and night. Most
   birds showed strong evidence of selective habitat use. Adults preferred
   the terrestrial vegetation (88\%), and avoided the lake and wetlands
   during the day. At night, 63\% of the birds selected the lake and
   wetlands. Nocturnal habitat use differed significantly between the
   non-breeding and breeding seasons, while the lake and wetland habitats
   were used more frequently during the non-breeding season. Most
   individuals showed strong site fidelity during the study, but habitat
   selection varied between individuals. Mean home range size was 9.78 ha
   (SE +/- 2.6) using the fixed kernel estimator (95\% kernel; 15 birds,
   each with > 25 locations). The average minimum convex polygon size was
   24 ha (SE +/- 5.6). The mean distance traveled between tracking
   locations was 178 in (SE +/- 30.5), with travel distances between points
   ranging tip to 1,649 in. Tracking duration varied from 31-121 days per
   bird (mean tracking duration 75 days).}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution and use of feeding areas by Olrog's Gull (Larus
   atlanticus) breeding within a 34 km(2) inlet at Golfo San Jorge,
   Argentina was investigated. Radio-transmitters were deployed on eight
   breeding adult birds during the late incubation period in 2001. Feeding
   areas were identified by means of radio-telemetry on the basis of 93
   bird locations during a total of 89 foraging trips, and by direct
   observation of instrumented birds on 23 occasions. Both telemetry and
   visual data indicated that Olrog's Gull fed almost exclusively within
   the inlet. In all, 85\% of mapped locations (N = 93) were within 3 km of
   the colony, near the month of the inlet. The birds were consistent in
   the use of one particular area, and most of the tracked birds foraged
   mainly in one or two areas. Mean number of trips per day was 4.1 +/-
   0.99 (range = 1-9) and mean trip duration was 109 +/- 31.2 min (range =
   15-645 minutes). Both variables differed significantly among
   individuals. Gulls foraged at all states of the tide, although all eight
   individuals were more likely to forage during mid and low tides than
   during high tides. The small foraging range of Olrog's Gull is defined
   by the spatial extension of intertidal habitats with crabs, being their
   main prey during the breeding season. Our results confirm the relatively
   high ecological specialization of Olrog's Gulls shown in previous diet
   studies and their dependence on interticlal areas with grapsid crabs.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinas) and Herring Gulls
   (L. argentatus) along coastal New England have changed dramatically
   during the last century. In recent years, Great Black-backed Gulls have
   displaced Herring Gulls from optimal breeding sites, thus potentially
   contributing to the recent decline of the Herring Gull. Although the
   quality of foraging habitat is also a strong determinate of reproductive
   success, potential for competition and interactions between these two
   species in natural foraging habitats have been largely ignored. In this
   study, the diet and prey preference of the two species were compared. In
   addition, the spatial and temporal patterns in foraging activities were
   examined and interspecific interactions in the rocky intertidal zones
   were also described. Diet and prey preference of the two species greatly
   overlapped, with both species consuming a large percentage of marine
   invertebrates (30-60\%), especially crabs. Foraging differed, and the
   Great Black-backed Gull consumed more crabs from the shallow subtidal
   zone than the Herring Gull. In regions where numbers of gulls were
   relatively high, Great Black-backed Gulls initiated all aggressive
   interspecific interactions. In September, when some Great Black-backed
   Gulls had moved from breeding to overwintering grounds, 1) the size of
   Jonah Crab (Cancer borealis) carapaces increased in Herring Gull prey,
   and 2) the numbers of Herring Gulls consuming crabs increased. These
   findings suggest that during the breeding season, aggression by the
   Great Black-backed Gull, especially in areas of high numbers, may
   suppress the ability of the Herring Gull to forage and obtain larger
   crabs from the shallow subtidal zone at our study site.}},

Abstract = {{Leach's Storm Petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) is a difficult species to
   census because the birds nest in burrows, are nocturnal, and spend most
   of-their life at sea, only coming ashore to breed. Simply locating a
   suspected petrel burrow is inadequate for management and conservation
   purposes because it is not known if the burrow is in rise. The
   traditional method, of ``grubbing{''}, or reaching into suspected
   burrows to determine occupancy, is invasive, and of limited accuracy.
   Playback of specific calls during the nesting period may be used to
   check for burrow occupancy. I conducted a test of grubbing in comparison
   with vocal playbacks and use of a portable video camera to determine
   which methodology was most accurate, least invasive and most efficient
   in time and cost investment. The use of playbacks showed the most
   promise as a quick, low cost method for surveying these burrowing
   petrels. The camera method, though as thorough as the playbacks, was
   more expensive and time consuming, while the traditional method of
   grubbing proved to be highly inaccurate and invasive.}},

   Delta, the most important ardeid nesting area in south China according
   to this study. Although data were missing from over half of the known
   colonies, 2,300 nests of seven species were reported in Guangdong. In
   Guangxi, there were 2,365 nests of at least seven species, but little
   information was available for Hainan. Field counting of nests, and
   strengthening the protection of colonies against egg and chick
   collection, are recommended.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection by the Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus columbianus)
   was evaluated on the Colville River Delta prior to oil field development
   (1982-1989). Tundra Swan territories comprised a lake, used for refuge
   and foraging, and terrestrial habitats and ponds near the lake's
   perimeter used for foraging and nesting. Tundra swan sightings from
   early and late summer aerial surveys were used to investigate habitat
   selection at the territory and within-territory scale. At the territory
   or lake scale, swan sightings/lake increased with lake size, and
   increased from discrete to tapped (i.e., connected to a river channel)
   to drained lakes within size categories. Overall, 49\% of the variation
   in swan sightings/lake was explained by lake size and type, a
   size-x-type interaction term, and the proportion of lake perimeter
   comprised of Halophytic Ponds and Halophytic Wet Meadows. At the
   within-territory or within-lake scale, foraging swans significantly
   selected Halophytic Ponds, Halophytic Wet Meadows, and Fresh Ponds
   relative to Uplands; nesting swans significantly selected Halophytic
   Ponds and significantly avoided Fresh Wet Meadows relative to Uplands.
   Vegetation sampling indicated that sites used by Tundra Swans on river
   channels and tapped lakes were significantly more likely to have
   Sheathed Pondweed (Potamogeton vaginatus) than control sites. The three
   major components of Tundra Swan diet were Carex sedges, Sheathed
   Pondweed, and algae, together comprising 85\% of identifiable plant
   fragments in feces.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first detailed study of the diet of Glossy Ibis (Plegadis
   falcinellus) in Europe, from an expanding breeding colony in Donana,
   southwest Spain. In 2000, fecal samples, mainly from adults, were
   collected from 15 nests. In 2001, 36 regurgitates were collected, mainly
   from large chicks. Fecal contents were dominated by aquatic beetles
   (Coleoptera) and dragonfly (Odonata) larvae, which were present in 100\%
   and 93\% of samples respectively. Regurgitates contained mainly aquatic
   beetles (41\% by aggregate percent, mainly Cybister spp.), dragonfly
   larvae (29\%, mainly Sympetrum fonscolombei, Aeshna mixta and Anax
   imperator), Sharp-ribbed Salamanders (Pleurodeles waltl, 12\%) and Carp
   (Cyprinus carpio, 7\%). The absence of vertebrate and other hard remains
   from feces was presumably due to their excretion in pellets. Thus fecal
   analysis is not a suitable method to investigate the food of the Glossy
   Ibis. The results suggest that there may be no major difference in the
   diet of breeding adults and their chicks, and that the recent increase
   in numbers of this ibis in Donana is not explained by the abundance of
   introduced Red-swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the breeding
   area.}},

Abstract = {{In Heidelberg, Germany, a flock of feral Swan Geese (Anser cygnoides)
   and Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra) feed together on a lawn during winter.
   It was investigated whether the presence of geese provided benefits to
   coots in terms of reduced vigilance and whether the association incurs
   costs, e.g., by reduced foraging success. Further, the hypothesis was
   tested whether a decrease in vigilance rate is mirrored by an increase
   in feeding rate. A digital video camera was used to record behavior of
   the same individual. Head-Lip movements were considered to have vigilant
   function when the bill was raised up from the foraging position to a
   position nearly parallel with the horizontal line, or when raised to a
   position higher than the body ({''}high-cost vigilance{''}). Coot
   feeding in the presence of geese showed a significantly lower scan rate.
   Steps per minute did not differ between the coot with and without geese,
   but the time taken for 30 pecks was significantly shorter in the
   presence of geese. There was a significant negative correlation between
   feeding and scan rate, suggesting that scanning decreased peck rate.
   Further, scan rate was inversely correlated with total flock size
   (number of coot and geese), suggesting that coot recognized the geese as
   flock mates. Coot benefited from feeding in the proximity to geese by a
   lower scan rate and a higher peck rate, but they did not encounter costs
   in terms of reduced food quality as measured by step rate.}},

Abstract = {{Island-wide surveys for the endangered Mariana Subspecies of the Common
   Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus guami) were conducted on Guam and the
   Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from May through September
   2001. Based on these counts, the total adult moorhen population is
   estimated to be 287, with 154, 41, 2, and 90 adult moorhens on Saipan,
   Tinian, Rota, and Guam, respectively. Results suggest an overall
   increase in birds on Saipan and Tinian, although moorhen numbers on Guam
   may be declining. High counts of moorhens on Lake Hagoi, Tinian, during
   the wet season Suggested movement from Saipan to Tinian occurs at the
   onset of the wet season each year. Conservation efforts need to consider
   Saipan and Tinian moorhens as a single demographic unit. Further,
   monitoring of moorhens, invasive vegetation management, and predator and
   ungulate control on wetlands are critical for this small population.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the diet of nestlings and the overlap of trophic and spatial
   niches of sympatric Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and Yellow-crowned
   Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea) in a northern Brazilian mangrove swamp
   was made from 1993 to 1997. A collection of regurgitates from nestlings
   was taken and stratified samples were taken at foraging areas. Both
   species fed mainly on saltwater ocypodid crabs, the night heron being
   more stenophagous than the ibis. About 90\% of the prey of the night
   heron were Mangrove Land Crabs (Ucides cordatus) in the range 11-100 g,
   while fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) were 64\% of the diet of ibises, being
   mostly in the range 1.1-10 g. The niche of the ibis was broader than
   that of the night heron, both in trophic and spatial dimensions. The
   distribution in foraging areas of the Yellow-crowned Night Heron showed
   a significant, positive spatial correlation with its main prey. The land
   crab formed a significantly greater proportion in the bird's diet than
   its relative abundance in the field. Scarlet This distribution showed no
   significant spatial correlation with its prey. The niche overlap of the
   two birds was only moderate, and they seemed to use adjacent regions of
   the ecological space. As Mangrove Land Crabs and fiddler crabs are
   similar, the main factor of prey segregation between the two bird
   species seemed to be prey size. In relation to other geographical areas,
   both Yellow-crowned Night Heron and Scarlet This occupied more
   restricted trophic niches, which may be related to the high availability
   of prey in northern Brazilian mangroves. Prey availability is more
   stable in saltwater ecosystems than in freshwater ones, so the high
   levels of niche overlap should not be attributed to seasonally relaxed
   competition. Competition does not seem to play a significant role in
   defining guild structure. It is not clear if the Scarlet This in Brazil
   suffers physiological constraints from dietary salt, as has been
   reported from North America.}},

   Between 05.44 h and 20.19 h on 28 May, the bird engaged in eleven dive
   bouts, with a mean duration of 18.8 +/- 5.4 min. Mean dive duration was
   24.8 +/- 15.7 s; mean surface between dives was 15.2 +/- 12.7 s. No
   dives were initiated after 20.19 h. The bird spent 12.3\% of the at-sea

   and were then followed through chick-raising. The study was conducted at
   Bird Island, Massachusetts, USA, in 1996, a year when chick growth and
   survival appeared to be limited by food availability. Chick growth and
   survival were used as indirect measures of allocation of resources to
   current reproduction. Rates of change of body-mass and feather re-growth
   (ptilochronology) were used as indirect measures of allocation of
   resources to self-maintenance. The birds' mates were studied similarly,
   but were not handicapped. Experimental birds and pairs were compared to
   controls matched for laying date and clutch-size. Handicapped males
   re-grew tail-feathers pulled for ptilochronology significantly more
   slowly than controls. They and their mates raised significantly more
   young than controls. Older handicapped males lost more body-mass during
   chick-raising than their matched controls, whereas younger males lost
   less. These results conflict with the prediction of life-history theory
   that long-lived birds faced with increased costs of reproduction should
   allocate these costs to their offspring rather than to themselves.
   However, we point out several problems in using handicapping to test
   such predictions. The assumed effects of handicapping on the cost of
   flight and on foraging ability have not been verified or measured.
   Changes in reproductive effort are not measured directly, and the end
   points that have been investigated are often ambiguous. The assumption
   that older individuals consistently have lower residual reproductive
   value than younger individuals may be incorrect if there is selective
   survival of high-quality individuals within the study population.}},

Abstract = {{Colony-site tenacity commonly reflects the stability of nesting
   habitats. The match between nesting substrate and coloration pattern of
   the eggs in two reproductive groups of the Gull-billed Tern
   (Gelochelidon nilotica) in the south of Iberian Peninsula was
   investigated to tests the adaptiveness of colony-site tenacity. The
   terns showing high colony-site tenacity had 1) a closer match in color
   between the eggs and the nesting substrate and 2) a lower richness and
   diversity of egg colors and 3) a lower rate of egg loss from predation
   than the low colony-site tenacity ones. These results appear to be
   adaptive, resulting from a long-standing renesting in the same
   colony-site. However, such mimicry would be difficult to achieve for
   terns with low site-tenacity, where breeding occur in unstable habitats.
   These birds were frequently obliged to move from one location to another
   due to weather irregularity and water level in the reservoirs they bred.
   In addition, the occasional high predation pressures on both adults and
   chicks, manifested by the low-tenacity tern group studied, was also
   involved. The attainment of such egg-crypsis could be an important
   adaptive advantage favoring colony-site tenacity. In unstable habitats,
   however, there would be a trade-off between the benefits linked to
   colony-site tenacity and the negative effects of suboptimal
   reproduction. Additional experimental design and studies are, however,
   necessary to confirm these results and predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The first case of cooperative polyandry in the Common Tern (Sterna
   hirundo) is reported. During the breeding season of 2000 two males,
   originating from the same brood, bred together with a female, who was
   paired in the previous season with one of the males. Both males
   copulated with the female. All three terns incubated the eggs, brooded
   and fed the chicks, but in different proportions. Despite poor food
   supply and bad weather conditions during the breeding season 2000, this
   polyandrous trio reared two fledglings, one of which has returned to the
   native colony in 2002. In another case, a two-year old, unrelated male
   incubated a clutch belonging to a pair of terns for a few days. Possible
   reasons for this deviation from the common monogamous mating system are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the movements of flightless Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula

   Sea in Alaska. Estimates of site fidelity during the 21-day flightless
   period ranged from 1-100\%, with considerable variation among locations
   and within locations among years. There was no effect of low-level
   experimental disturbance or an underwater seismic survey on site
   fidelity of molting Long-tailed Ducks. Birds molting along a relatively
   consistent habitat gradient were more likely to move than those molting
   in a fragmented habitat. While flocks of birds are consistently observed
   in the same locations, these data suggest considerable turnover within
   these aggregations. These results, in conjunction with other studies,
   suggest that forage is relatively uniformly distributed within lagoons.
   We conclude that habitat selection by molting Long-tailed Ducks is
   likely influenced by protection from wind and associated waves.}},

Abstract = {{This study measured the summer mortality rate of breeding waterbirds
   during a period of three years (1998-2000) in the El Hondo wetland,
   Spain, an ecosystem of international importance for ornithological
   diversity. On average, 874 birds died each summer in the study period,
   but varied from 199 birds in 1998, to 1,690 in 1999. When the observed
   mortality was expressed as a percentage of the initial breeding
   populations, the death rates ranged from 1.6\% per month in 1998 to
   7.7\% in 1999. Many of the dead birds gave positive results for the
   presence of different enterocolic bacteria (30\% to 60\%). and for the
   presence of lead shot in their gizzards (30\%). These results cannot be
   however interpreted as percentages causing the ultimate death because
   many individuals could be only carriers of enterocolic infections and,
   in addition, many of our positive results for the presence of lead
   correspond to sub-lethal values. Nevertheless, our results suggest that
   a significant decrease in the summer mortality rate of waterbirds could
   be probably achieved by improving the water quality of the ponds in
   periods of low water levels and by extracting the sources of lead either
   manually or mechanically.}},

Abstract = {{Stiff-tailed ducks (Oxyurini) are reputed to be unique among waterfowl
   in having two complete wing and tail molts annually. We examined molt
   patterns in wild Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis) and in captives of
   known age. Adults of both groups underwent a complete wing molt in early
   autumn. A spring wing molt was very rare in wild Ruddy Ducks, but
   occurred more often in captives, especially in adult females. Ruddy
   Ducks replace rectrices twice annually. These molts are complete but
   unusual in that feathers are typically replaced in two waves, in which
   (1) every other rectrix is lost and largely re-grown before (2) the
   intervening feathers are molted. As a result, the molt is protracted and
   the tail plumage, at times, includes feathers of two generations. The
   pattern ensures that a functional tail is maintained at all times.}},

Abstract = {{A 28-year (1974-2002) study of the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) was
   conducted on Bird Island and Tel-fair Island at Cedar Creek Reservoir in
   northeast Texas to determine trends and dynamics of clutch/brood sizes,
   hatching success, chick mortality, and nest-site vegetation. For the
   breeding colonies on these islands, annual mean clutch size ranged from
   2.71-3.73 (overall mean = 2.98) and from 2.56-4.18 (overall mean =
   3.33); annual mean brood sizes ranged from 2.20-3.08 (overall mean =
   2.60) and from 2.38-3.67 (overall mean = 2.87). Annual mean hatching
   success on the islands was high throughout the study (78\%-94\%
   {[}overall mean = 88\%] and 71\%-96\% {[}overall mean = 86\%]). Annual
   mean chick mortality was low (0.5\%-13\% {[}overall mean = 4.5\%] and
   0\%-10\% {[}overall mean = 2.1\%]). Among marked broods on both islands,
   only 6.5\% lost chicks, for which the mean loss was 1.16 chicks/brood.
   Generally, within these broods, there was higher mortality of the
   younger chicks. In broods of more than two chicks, the mortality ratio
   between Ist- and 2nd-hatched chicks was lower than other combinations of
   sibling rank. Decline of nest density coincided with the cumulative
   adverse effects of guanotrophication on nest-site vegetation. The
   original native nest-site vegetation was replaced by Chinaberry (Melia
   azedarach), an exotic tree that provided optimal nest sites until it too
   became intolerant to guanotrophy, which resulted in a continued decline
   in nest-site vegetation. During the time of declining availability of
   nest-site vegetation, the egrets began ground nesting; by 2002, 48\% of
   nests were on the ground.}},

Pages = {{79-82}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In 2001, predator exclosures were used to protect nests of the Western
   Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) in western Alaska. During the exclosure
   experiment, nest contents in exclosures had significantly higher daily
   survival rates than control nests, however, late in the study predators
   began to cue in on exclosures and predate the nest contents. An Arctic
   Fox (Alopex lagapus) dug under one exclosure and took the newly hatched
   chicks, and Long tailed Jaegers (Stercorarius longicaudus) learned to
   associate exclosures with active nests and repeatedly visited them. The
   jaegers attempted to gain access to exclosed nests and pursued adult
   sandpipers as they emerged from the exclosures. The exclosures were
   removed to reduce potential mortality to adult and young sandpipers, but
   subsequently, post-exclosure nests had lower daily survival rates than
   controls during the same time period. Predation of post-exclosure eggs
   and chicks highlighted the lasting influence of the exclosure treatment
   on offspring survival because predators probably remembered nest
   locations. Researchers are urged to use caution when considering use of
   predator exclosures in areas where jaegers occur.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-88}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{South Carolina winters a large proportion (over 1/3) of the eastern race
   of the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), a declining
   species. During December of 1999-2002 ground surveys were conducted to
   provide baseline data on the abundance, age class partitioning and
   distribution of wintering American Oystercatchers in South Carolina. The
   number of oystercatchers in South Carolina was stable during this study
   (3,536, 95\% CI: 3,030, 4,042). A single comprehensive survey can
   estimate the number of oystercatchers with enough precision to detect
   changes in the population of 13\% and greater, but location of flocks
   and the range of tidal heights needed to concentrate flocks must be
   known prior to conducting the survey. About 89\% of the birds in 2002
   roosted on washed shell rakes and 9\% had immature bill coloration.
   Winter surveys of the proportion of immature oystercatchers may provide
   an index of regional reproductive success, an important parameter for
   conservation plans. Because South Carolina winters a large number of
   oystercatchers, future surveys could be used to verify suspected
   declines on a regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{We studied aspects of the reproduction of Kittlitz's Murrelet
   (Brachyramphus brevirostris) in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in
   1996-1998. Productivity in all bays was extremely low in all years: only
   one fledgling in 1996, none in 1997, and evidence of breeding (but no
   fledglings seen) in 1998. Other evidence suggested that these birds
   spent such short periods in two of the bays that they could not have
   bred successfully. We also observed what appeared to be mixed-species
   ``pairs{''} of Kittlitz's and Marbled Murrelets (B. marmoratus) in early
   summer 1997 and on all late-summer cruises. Although breeding failures
   may not be uncommon in Kittlitz's Murrelet, the low reproductive output
   in all three years and the occurrence of mixed-species pairs are sources
   of conservation concern and suggest that this species may be
   experiencing problems reproducing successfully in Prince William Sound.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow-eyed Penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is monomorphic but
   exhibits subtle sexual morphometric dimorphism. Information on the sexes
   of these birds is needed for informed management of the species and the
   construction of accurate population models. Using DNA analysis and
   Discriminant Function Analysis on head and foot measurements, we tested
   whether adults and fledglings of Yellow-eyed Penguin can be sexed using
   morphometry. We found that head and foot measurements can be used to
   correctly sex up to 93\% of adults. Using only foot length, 88\% of
   fledglings can be sexed accurately. As age until fledging was found to
   have an effect on morphometric variables, sexing should be conducted as
   synchronized as possible when chicks are over 90 days of age. We
   recommend that error rates inherent in sexing fledglings be taken into
   account when publishing sex-ratio data and subsequent analyses,
   particularly when age of fledglings could not be determined. The use of
   whole-skull measurements for sexing may be useful in other species in
   which bill measurements between the sexes are only slightly dimorphic or
   contains large degrees of overlap.}},

Abstract = {{In eastern Canada during the early 1990s, a shift in the distribution of
   Capelin (Mallotus villosus) resulted in a prolonged absence (at least 8
   years) of the preferred prey for the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula
   arctica) breeding at Gannet Islands, Labrador. It has been documented
   that there is no suitable alternative prey to Capelin in the northwest
   Atlantic for seabirds, thus these extreme changes in food supply may
   have negative effects on reproduction and adult survivorship. In this
   study, foraging behavior, chick growth and productivity of Atlantic
   Puffins at the Gannet Islands, Labrador during 1996-1998 were compared
   to data in a study undertaken in 1981-1983, prior to the decline in
   Capelin abundance. It was confirmed that the dramatic change in Capelin
   abundance was reflected in chick diet as Atlantic Puffin chicks received
   50-70\% (by mass) less Capelin in 1996-1998 than in 1981-1983. Hatch
   dates did not differ among decades and breeding success, chick wing
   growth and fledge mass were unaffected. The only breeding parameter
   significantly affected by the change in food supply was chick growth
   (mass gain). Taken together, our data indicated that following a decline
   in Capelin abundance, the Atlantic Puffin did not experience breeding
   failure and effectively reared young utilizing suitable alternative prey
   which included post-larval sandlance and other small fish and
   invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting chronology, habitat use, subcolony use, and hatchability were
   documented for the Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax)
   nesting at Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, California during
   1990-2002. Reproductive success was estimated using the Mayfield method
   and compared among years. Totals of monitored nests per year ranged from
   68 in 2001 to 341 in 1996, with a trend of declining numbers since 1996.
   An increase in numbers of the Western Gull (Larus occidentalis), the
   Black-crowned Night Heron's primary competitor, occurred during the same
   period. Overall reproductive success of the Black-crowned Night Heron at
   Alcatraz Island was below the 13-year average of 56.4\% since 1996.
   During the study, the average number of chicks fledged per nest each
   year ranged from 0.46 to 1.27, which is less than the two chicks per
   nest suggested as a requirement for a sustained population. Embryos in
   five of 187 failed Black-crowned Night Heron eggs were deformed. In 1990
   and 1991, eggs were analyzed for a wide range of contaminants, but none
   appeared to be sufficiently elevated to have caused the observed
   deformities. Based on these relatively low levels of contaminants, a
   high hatchability rate (94.5\%), and relatively low levels of
   embryotoxicity, contaminants did not appear to significantly affect
   Black-crowned Night Heron reproduction at Alcatraz Island. However,
   predation by the Common Raven (Corvus corax) and Western Gull,
   interspecific competition with the Western Gull, habitat deterioration,
   and possible human disturbance are likely factors contributing to the
   decline in Black-crowned Night Heron reproductive success on Alcatraz
   Island in recent years.}},

Abstract = {{We counted the heronries at two study areas in China, where important
   but unknown numbers breed. At Poyang Lake, within a 1,800 km(2) area, we
   found ten heronries with Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), Intermediate
   Egret (Egretta intermedia), Great White Egret (Ardea alba), Cattle Egret
   (Bubulcus ibis), Chinese Pond Heron (Ardeola bacchus), and Black-crowned
   Night Heron (Nycticarax nycticorax), and at Tai Lake we found five
   heronries within a 4000 km(2) area. Heronry size ranged from a few
   hundred nests to 36,400 nests. Several heronries were located within
   human settlements, in contrast with the sites used in Europe and in
   North America, where herons tend to avoid human disturbance. An
   extrapolation of the mean densities observed at the two study areas, for
   all the zones of mainland China that are cultivated mostly with rice,
   provide a first estimate of a total numbers of up to some five million
   nests of herons and egrets, which is much higher than previously
   suggested for China.}},

   the previous census of 1995/96. The number of King Penguin chicks
   decreased by 19\% from 339 to 275, which is probably a reflection of
   variable breeding success, rather than a decline in breeding pairs. The
   number of Gentoo Penguins increased by 79\%, from 64,426 breeding pairs
   in 1995/96 to 115,327 breeding pairs in 2000/01. The Rockhopper Penguin
   numbers appeared to be stable, with 286,964 breeding pairs in 2000/01
   compared to 263,590 breeding pairs in 1995/96 (the difference being

   Data were obtained for one, two and three consecutive foraging trips of
   three, one and two birds, respectively. These data showed that
   individual Little Penguins presented distinct diving depths that are
   consistent from one trip to the next. Four birds exploited shallow
   depths, around 1-5 in, but two other birds always chose to dive deeper,
   to around 8-10 in. No trends could be established between the adult mass
   or the chick mass and the preferred diving depths. The causes and
   consequences of these individual diving strategies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For most birds, it is difficult to study what life would be like without
   nest sites. In penguins, however, nesting and non-nesting species can be
   compared. We contrasted the King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus),
   which has no nest and carries its chick on its feet, with the Macaroni
   Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), which has a nest similar to other
   birds. We investigated the use of the nest site when it ceased to be
   necessary, that is, after chick emancipation during the creche period.
   When adults return to their crowded colony from foraging at sea, both
   penguin species exhibit individual recognition between parents and
   chicks via calls. Observations were made on how parents find and feed
   large chicks. We examined whether the use of the empty nest as a
   geographical meeting place was advantageous to Macaroni Penguin parents
   looking for their chicks, and whether the more sophisticated recognition
   of calls aided King Penguin parents in searching for their chicks.
   Macaroni Penguin parents found their chicks in about half a minute,
   giving two or three calls to bring chicks to the site of their previous
   nest. In contrast, King Penguin parents took longer (about three
   minutes) to find their chicks, and gave four or five calls to attract
   chicks. In addition, about a quarter of Mug Penguin parents had to walk
   an average of 11-12 m through the creche in order to find a chick to
   feed. For Macaroni chicks and their parents, the nest was used as a
   ``rendezvous{''} location that facilitated reunion.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of waterfowl becoming entangled and killed in netting
   suspended over fishponds, and the effectiveness of this technique in
   excluding birds from fishponds, was studied at two fish farms in Israel.
   A variety of physical and environmental factors of 101 netted fishponds
   with 20 net types were recorded, as were the number and species of dead
   birds entangled in the netting, and those observed alive under the
   netting. Numbers of dead birds were mainly a function of the net's
   visibility: with fewer dead birds in small mesh size, and also in thick
   or dark-colored netting. Large numbers of dead birds occurred in netting
   made of thin monofilament even though it had small mesh size. The number
   of live birds at netted ponds was mainly a function of poor net
   maintenance, rather than net type. The results Were used to formulate
   guidelines for using netting over fishponds in Israel, that include:
   fishpond netting should be made of thick, dark-colored material with
   small mesh size (<5 cm), and a total ban should be imposed on the use of
   thin monofilament nets. These guidelines will allow for better bird
   conservation, while reducing conflict between fish-farm managers and
   piscivorous birds.}},

Abstract = {{Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata) have been extirpated from some islands in
   the Seychelles through habitat modification, introduction of exotic
   predators and over-exploitation of their eggs. Recently, removal of
   exotic predators and habitat restoration have made some islands
   available for the re-introduction of or re-colonization by former
   breeding birds. Attempts will be made to encourage Sooty Terns to
   re-colonize formerly occupied islands that are now deemed suitable to
   support colonies, using decoy models and broadcasts of recorded
   vocalizations. As, a prelude to these attempts, this study measured the
   sound levels produced within a Sooty Tern colony at different times of
   day and season, in order that broadcasts can reasonably well simulate
   the sounds produced naturally. Statistically significant diurnal and
   seasonal differences in sound levels were recorded, related to differing
   activities of the adult birds during the breeding season. Our results
   suggested that broadcasting equipment Should be capable of producing
   Sooty Tern colony vocalizations at sound levels at least 85-90 dB, at a
   distance of about three m from the speakers, in the intended nesting
   area. Potential human health risks of prolonged exposure to
   vocalizations within Sooty tern colonies are highlighted.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Protected lands contain a large proportion of existing critical habitat
   for many wading bird species, but human activities in these areas have
   the potential to adversely effect these species. The effects of passing
   vehicles on the foraging behavior of wading birds was studied using
   observational and experimental methods at the Merritt Island National
   Wildlife Refuge near Titusville, Florida. Foraging wading birds were
   more likely to be disturbed when vehicles slowed or stopped adjacent to
   them, than when vehicles continued driving by. In an area with a high
   rate of human visitation, some individual wading birds responded more
   strongly to passing vehicles than did others, suggesting that some were
   habituated to disturbance. Experimental disturbance by a vehicle caused
   a significant depression in the foraging rates of the Snowy Egret
   (Egretta thula) and the Great Egret (Ardea alba) and non-significant
   reductions in foraging rates in the Tricolored Heron (E. tricolor).
   Nineteen percent of the birds flushed following disturbance. The
   proximity of the disturbance vehicle influenced the probability of
   flushing in a species-specific manner with tire Tricolored Heron being
   the most sensitive, the Great Egret intermediate, and the Snowy Egret
   the least sensitive. Recommendations to managers include concentrating
   ecotourism in certain areas and educating ecotourists about the effects
   of their behavior on wading birds.}},

Abstract = {{We exposed 13 species of waterbirds (Pelecaniformes, Cicorniformes,

   flush distances. Five lakes with different levels of airboat activity
   were visited in central Florida during April-August 1999 to 2001. We
   detected considerable variation in flush distances among, individuals
   within the same species and significant differences among species in
   response to an airboat. Average flush distances among all species ranged
   from 49 m for the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) to 172 m for the
   Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Average flush distances among
   herons ranged from 65 m for the Tricolored Heron (Egretta tiicolor) to
   113 m for the Great Egret (Ardea alba). Larger species generally
   exhibited greater average flush distances. A comparison of the flush
   distances elicited by a fast moving outboard-powered boat and an airboat
   indicated that all nine species exhibited significantly greater flush
   distances to the approach of an airboat. Recommended buffer zones that
   Would minimize disturbance of waterbirds while foraging and loafing
   ranged from about 130 in (Snail Kite) to 365 in (Bald Eagle) for raptors

   Average nest abundance for the Cattle Egret was 0.045 +/- 0.041 (95\%
   CI) nests.m(-3) of canopy volume, and 0.026 +/- 0.019 (95\% CI)
   nests(-1) volume(3) of canopy volume for the Little Egret. Total
   estimated population size was 882 nesting pairs (Cattle Egrets 550;
   Little Egrets = 332). Cattle Egrets occupied higher trees for nesting
   than Little Egrets. Both species nested above the middle of the nesting
   trees. The clutch size of Cattle Egrets averaged 3.03 eggs whereas mean
   clutch size of Little Egrets was 3.22 eggs. A higher hatching success in
   the Cattle Egret than in the Little Egret suggested a relationship
   between nest selection and hatching success.}},

Abstract = {{Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) may winter in northern areas if they have
   access to adequate food and open water. We compared individual body size
   (indexed by first principal component scores from three morphometric
   measurements) and body condition (body mass adjusted for body size) of
   male Mallard wintering in North Dakota, USA during 1996-99 with a
   baseline reference group of Mallard from Ontario, Canada measured during
   late summer. Size and condition of Mallard wintering in North Dakota was
   also compared, using a sample from a traditional wintering area in
   Arkansas, USA. Male Mallard body size and condition in North Dakota
   relative to weather severity during mid-winter was assessed. Body size
   of adult males in North Dakota was significantly greater than that of
   birds from Ontario, but Similar to those from Arkansas. Adult males
   remaining in North Dakota during the coldest winter were not larger than
   those remaining in North Dakota during milder winters. Immature males in
   North Dakota were significantly smaller than those from Arkansas, and
   the former were not larger during the coldest winter. Body condition of
   adult males in North Dakota was greater than that of those from Ontario
   and Arkansas and mean body mass of adult males in North Dakota during
   winter was greater than that of those wintering elsewhere. Further,
   adult males in North Dakota were in the best condition during the
   coldest winter. Mean body condition of immature males in North Dakota
   was similar to that of those from Arkansas. Body mass of immatures in
   North Dakota was similar to that of immatures wintering elsewhere. These
   findings indicate that maintenance of high fat reserves. not large body
   size, is the primary factor allowing adult males to winter in the
   extremely cold conditions of North Dakota. The small size of immature
   males in North Dakota, combined with the lack of evidence of their
   Superior condition as compared to those wintering elsewhere, suggests
   that immatures wintering in North Dakota are mainly late-hatched
   individuals that may not have been able to store sufficient fat reserves
   to migrate before freeze-up.}},

Abstract = {{Terns of the genus Chlidonias may be exceptional among the larids in
   laying the ultimate egg in the clutch-sequence that is not smaller than
   the earlier eggs. To investigate this, we analyzed data on egg length,
   breadth, Volume and shape in three-egg clutches of the White-winged Tern
   (Chlidonias leucopterus) breeding in NE Poland. Both length and Volume
   of the c-egg was larger than mean values the a- and b-eggs in the
   clutch. They also differed in shape. Egg breadth did not differ in Such
   a comparison. Two species of Chlidonias terns do not conform to the
   typical pattern of larids, in which the last-laid egg is the smallest in
   the clutch; this may be related to their being insectivorous rather than
   piscivorous. Chlidonias terns lay eggs of the size expected from the
   regression of mean egg size on mean female body size in all the Western
   Palearctic terns.}},

Abstract = {{A census of the Grand Manan Archipelago, New Brunswick, Canada, found
   nine seabird species nesting at 22 sites. Herring Gull (Larus
   argentatus) and Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) were the most widely
   distributed species, with a combined 89\% of all breeding seabirds in
   the region. Although fewer, the Great Blackbacked Gull (Larus marinus)
   and Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle) were widely distributed. Other
   seabirds had more limited distributions; one Common Tern (Sterna
   hirundo) colony, three Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus)
   colonies and one mixed colony of Razorbill (Alca torda) and Common Murre
   (Uria aalge). Leach's Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) numbers were
   not determined, but were found nesting on three islands and were
   suspected to be nesting on two others. Comparisons with historical data
   showed increases in gulls, Razorbill and Common Murre, whereas eiders
   had remained relatively stable over the past two decades, but had
   decreased in recent years. Insufficient data are available to assess
   trends of other seabird species nesting around Grand Manan. Fluctuations
   in cormorant numbers may be a result of moving breeding sites. The
   recent decrease in eider numbers may be a consequence of low survival
   rates of young and increasing numbers of predatory gulls. Considerable
   discrepancies were observed between recent and historical gull numbers
   which may have resulted from 1) differences in survey methodology, and
   2) survey timing. This study provides estimates of breeding seabirds,
   which can be used as baseline data for future monitoring in the Grand
   Manan Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{The European Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) breeds in a wide range of
   nest-sites depending on the locality, such as crevices under fallen
   rocks, open ground caves and open ledges on craggy cliffs. In this paper
   the habitat selection of shags breeding in cavities on the coastal
   slopes of Islas Cies (Galicia, Northwest Iberian Peninsula) are
   examined. Shags selected sites with more lateral and overhead cover,
   with better drainage and with average visibility. In addition, sites
   where breeding was successful differed from unsuccessful sites.
   Nest-site characteristics especially affected the hatching success. In
   this colony, shags showed adaptive responses to site-quality
   variability. Thus, nest-site quality declined with density and with
   seasonal occupancy. Shag colonies seem to follow an ideal despotic
   distribution, where some individuals monopolize high quality sites and
   prevented other individuals from settling in the good sites. Further
   studies are required to assess the proximal mechanisms used for
   nest-site selection in this species.}},

Abstract = {{In coastal environs during the non-breeding season, many shorebirds
   (suborder Charadrii) congregate at roosts, long considered to be
   traditional sites where flocks of individuals coalesce when high tides
   inundate feeding areas. Humboldt Bay, California was Surveyed (9.5
   months at roughly 10-d intervals) to assess temporal variation in
   incidence (proportion of 28 surveys birds used a roost), proportional
   abundance, concentrations, and repeatability (of seasonal average
   proportional abundances) of shorebird use of diurnal, high-tide roosts.
   Two hundred and forty roosting locations were identified and
   observations were made of 30 species. Fourteen species accounted for
   over 99\% of observations. Shorebirds occurred at most roosts
   infrequently (<20\% of surveys) and only 4\% of roosts had roosting
   birds present on more than 80\% of occasions. Abundant species occurred
   at more roosts (20-141 roosts per species) compared with less common
   species. Even at the most-used roosts, abundances at the species level
   varied greatly. Repeatability of roost use among seasons was high. At
   Humboldt Bay, roost use formed a continuum from ephemeral locations used
   by a few birds to sites used consistently by large numbers of
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{We identified environmental variables and grassland characteristics that
   affect the use of natural grasslands by four migratory shorebird species
   (Patagonian: Rufous-Chested Dotterel (Charadrius modestus) and
   Tawny-throated Dotterel (Oreopholus ruficollis); Nearctic: American
   Golden Plover (Pluvialis dominica) and Buff-breasted Sandpiper
   (Tryngites subruficollis)) during the non-breeding season in the
   flooding pampa region of Argentina. Birds were recorded using
   fixed-radius point Count method, every 15 days between April 1999 and
   January 2000. A stepwise forward logistic regression was used to examine
   the relationship between the presence of shorebirds and grassland
   characteristics and environmental variables. All species correlated
   positively with the variable ``previous use{''} suggesting strong site
   fidelity within years to a wintering site. All species correlated
   negatively with the percentage of high grass cover, and the American
   Golden Plover and Buff-breasted Sandpiper both correlated negatively
   with soil water content. Tawny-throated Dotterel correlated positively
   with the presence of Stipa neesiana. Previous studies have identified
   the coastal grasslands of Buenos Aires province as important sites for
   wintering ne-arctic and Patagonian grassland shorebirds. This study
   confirms the importance of this area, and highlights the important role
   that sheep management plays in maintaining suitable habitat conditions
   (short grass) for grassland shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of vigilant behavior in an urban flock of Swan Geese (Anser
   cygnoides) and their hybrids in Heidelberg in southwest Germany were
   carried out between 31 May and 22 July 2002. The habitat is
   characterized (i) vigilance is by a high rate of human disturbance and
   by artificial feeding. The following hypotheses were tested: increased
   due to disturbances on many occasions, (ii) vigilance should follow
   general patterns found in natural populations, e.g., the many-eyes
   hypothesis and (iii) vigilance may or may not differ between hybrids and
   trite Swan Geese. Time spent vigilant during a 2-minute-bout of grazing
   averaged 15.5 s, which made tip 13\% of the nine budget. This amount is
   not high compared to studies of other geese species in natural
   environments. There was no (difference between Swan Geese and their
   hybrids in the duration. Vigilance was not dependent upon the number of
   birds present as predicted by the many-eyes hypothesis, and did not
   depend on the distance to water line nor position of the bird (center
   versus edge of the flock). Therefore, vigilance may serve other
   functions such as stealing food from others, detecting human passers-by
   with food or avoid interference between conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike other alcids, laying of replacement eggs has not been well
   documented in Brachyramphus murrelets. Observations of two radio-marked
   Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in northern California
   during 2001 and 2002 Suggested that they can re-lay in the same breeding
   season. In 2001, aircraft telemetry first detected a male Marbled
   Murrelet at a forested inland location on 17 May. This bird alternated
   24h incubation bouts with 24h at sea periods until 29 May, when data
   logger recordings indicated that the bird arrived at the nest at 05.17 h
   (PDT), but left at 05.32 h. This nesting effort had apparently failed.
   Sixteen days later, on 14 June this murrelet arrived in the vicinity, of
   the first nest site at 05.19 h and remained there until 18.57 h that
   same evening and then left. We suspected that this event represented a
   second breeding effort that also failed, either near or at the site of
   the first effort. In 2002 a female Marbled Murrelet, first detected
   inland on 13 June by aircraft telemetry, alternated on the nest one day
   and at sea the next until 23 June when the breeding effort is presumed
   to have failed. This bird was again detected inland on 21 July, and
   alternated on the nest one day and at sea the following day until 3
   August, when the radio-transmitter fell off the bird. Video recordings
   at the nest site indicated this second nesting attempt continued until 1
   September, when the chick died of unknown causes. As in other alcids,
   re-laying apparently occurred 2-4 weeks after failure of the first eggs,
   either near or at the site of first eggs. Re-nesting may be frequent in
   murrelets, given the high rates of breeding failure reported.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) daily from
   small boats in Auke Bay and Fritz Cove, Alaska, from May through August
   1992 and 1993. Differences in numbers of juveniles and in the timing of
   their presence in the study area between the two years indicated that
   breeding phenology was late and productivity was low in 1992 compared to
   1993. This difference was consistent with variability in the physical
   environment. Of 99 fish identified in the bills of fish-holding adult
   murrelets, 81 (82\%) were Pacific Sand Lance (Ammodytes hexapterus).
   Counts of fish-holding adult murrelets were significantly higher in the
   evening than at any other time of day. Time of day had no significant
   effects on counts of fledglings, indicating that juveniles were moving
   into and out of the study area during the day. Murrelets were
   predominantly found in groups of two or more, even during incubation,
   suggesting that murrelets incur an appreciable benefit, such as
   increased foraging efficiency, from foraging in groups. For both
   summers, there was no correlation between counts of murrelets on the
   water and numbers of murrelet detections in the adjacent forest. We
   suggest that many behavior patterns of the Marbled Murrelet (displaying,
   choosing of mates, and pair-bonding, finding of nest sites and
   successful foraging of juveniles) may be socially facilitated.}},

Abstract = {{Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) encounter a variety of climatic
   regimes in their annual cycle. The most dramatic occur while on staging
   areas in autumn. We investigated the thermoregulatory abilities of the
   Eared Grebe to determine how they coped with these climate changes
   during staging. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) was higher than
   predicted. Mass-specific BMR was 1.212 mL O-2/g(.)h for birds averaging
   317 g. The thermoneutral zone is wide and extended from 15degreesC to
   38degreesC. Minimal thermal conductance and average body temperature
   were not unusual. We conclude that Eared Grebes live most of the year
   under thermoneutral conditions and that food availability, not
   temperature extremes, determines the timing of their winter migration.}},

Abstract = {{Avoidance of predators has long been regarded as it major benefit in
   colonial breeding. Nevertheless, field and comparative studies have not
   shown a clear relationship between predation and coloniality. In the
   present study, we examine the association between aerial egg predation
   on the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), and sub-colony size, nest
   aggregation and reproductive synchrony. Fieldwork was carried out at the
   Ebro Delta colony (north-western Mediterranean), where Common Terns
   breed syntopically with potential predators. Sub-colonies placed in a
   small area were used instead of distant colonies in an attempt to
   minimize site effects, e.g., the abundance of predators. We used
   logistic regression with random effect (i.e., sub-colony) to test
   simultaneously the effect of the studied factors on the risk of
   predation. In addition, the random effect allowed us to account for the
   extra-binomial variability due to the potential non-independence of
   nests of the same sub-colony (clustered observations). Our results
   support the contention that both breeding in large colonies and in
   aggregated territories confers protection against aerial predators. In
   addition, synchrony in relation to the whole colony had no effect on the
   risk of egg predation. However, birds breeding asynchronously earlier in
   the season than the average in their own sub-colony were more likely to
   suffer egg predation than eggs front late asynchronous nesters.}},

Abstract = {{The need to understand how wildlife responds to the broad-ranging
   impacts of development is becoming increasingly important as human
   populations around the globe continue to increase and urbanize. We
   studied waterbird behavioral associations with developed and undeveloped
   shorelines on four partially developed urban lakes in central Florida.
   Summer observations revealed that wading birds foraged significantly
   more along developed shoreline, and that ducks rested and tended young
   significantly more along developed shoreline. Winter observations
   revealed that marsh birds foraged significantly more along undeveloped
   shoreline but displayed active/swimming behavior significantly more
   along developed shoreline. Summer ducks and winter wading birds showed
   significantly greater alert/flee behavior along undeveloped shoreline.
   Ducks in both seasons showed significantly greater alert/flee behavior
   than other guilds. For all guilds, alert/flee behavior was seen 1.6
   times more often in the winter. Winter migrants did not show greater
   alert/flee behavior than resident birds. Results show that a wide range
   of waterbirds call use urban lakes during the breeding and non-breeding
   seasons, and that many birds appear to favor developed shorelines for a
   variety of behavioral patterns. However, dense stands of tall emergent
   vegetation along undeveloped shoreline may limit waterbird behavior
   along this, shoreline. The heightened alert/ flee behavior observed
   along undeveloped shorelines may warrant the use of buffer zones to
   protect birds using these shorelines from undue human disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive wading bird nesting database for the Everglades
   watershed in south Florida was compiled for the time period of 1903
   through 2001. The limitations and applications of this database were
   assessed with the purpose of ultimately strengthening wading bird
   performance measures used as an index of ecosystem integrity for the
   Everglades restoration effort. The database is limited for some
   inferences, such as comparing between individual years, because of a
   lack of standardization in sampling methodology. As such, it should be
   used as an index of wading bird numbers rather than as an absolute
   population measure. However, the database is adequate to understand
   long-term, system-wide trends and the range of variability in nesting
   effort by the wading birds. Results from the analyses indicate that
   trends in numbers of nesting wading birds differ among species. It is
   estimated that the number of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) and Wood Stork
   (Mycteria americana) nests have decreased by 87\% and 78\%,
   respectively, in the Everglades since the 1930s. There has also been a
   significant increase in the time interval between large nesting events
   for White Ibis and Wood Stork and a decrease in the magnitude of large
   nesting events for White Ibis over the past 70 years. The number of
   Great Egret (Ardea alba) nests has increased, the magnitude of large
   nesting events has increased, and the interval between large nesting
   events has decreased. There has also been a 61\% decrease in the
   percentage of wading bird nests located in the southern Everglades and a
   46\% increase in the percentage of nests located in the central northern
   Everglades since the 1980s. These types of quantitative comparisons can
   be used to refine and strengthen the proposed wading bird performance
   measures used to gauge the health of the Everglades for the Everglades
   restoration effort. The time interval between large nesting events may
   be appropriate as an additional performance measure because it may
   capture the variable nature of wading bird numbers in response to
   hydrologic fluctuations in the Everglades.}},

Abstract = {{Attempts at intraspecific kleptoparasitism by Lesser Black-backed Gulls
   (Larus fuscus) feeding at a rubbish dump in southwest Spain during the
   winter 2001-2002 were studied to measure differences in the frequency of
   attacks between the age classes, the success of the attacks and the
   existence of possible density-dependent kleptoparasitism. Significant
   age differences in the frequency of attacks initiated were not found,
   although first year birds received a higher number of attacks. The
   success of the attacks increased with the age of the kleptoparasite and
   decreased with the age of the victim. The gulls selected victims of an
   equal or younger age to their own. A correlation was found between
   density and number of attacks on most dates. The possibility exists that
   kleptoparasitism could influence the success of the recent expansion of
   the species in the Iberian Peninsula.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of distance between members of pairs of the Ruddy Shelduck
   (Tadorna ferruginea) during vigilance behavior was studied during winter
   at Lijiang Lashihai Lake Reserve, southwest China. The distance between
   the paired birds while feeding was grouped into three categories: <1 m,
   1-3 to and >3 m. Nearly 90\% of the distances recorded between paired
   males and females were within three meters. The degree of vigilance
   increased with distance apart for females, but not for males. The
   scanning rate of males was significantly, higher than that of females at
   <1 m and at 1-3 m respectively, but no significant difference occurred
   when the distance between them was >3 m. These results are discussed in
   relation to mate competition and wintering strategy; it is suggested
   that staving close together is the optimal strategy for members of Ruddy
   Shelduck pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent taxonomic revisions off the Wandering Albatross sensu lato
   resulted in four separate species, the rarest of which is the Tristan
   Albatross (Diomedea dabbenena). We present the first detailed
   morphometric measurements of the male and female of the Tristan
   Albatross. The results are used to separate this species from the more
   common nominate taxon of Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) frorn
   South Georgia. The Tristan Albatross is smaller than the Wandering
   Albatross in all measured variables, and males are larger than females
   in both species. A combination of bill measurements discriminated
   97-98\% of individuals of the two species, and tarsus and bill
   measurements allowed the sex of birds from both species to be
   determined. If the sex of the bird is known, then bill length should
   identify all individuals to species. This result is useful to allow
   fishery observers to correctly identity albatrosses killed on longlines
   in the Atlantic Ocean. However, care has to be taken outside this
   region, because the Tristan Albatross is very similar in size to
   published measurements of Gibson's Albatross (Diomedea gibsoni) and the
   Antipodes Albatross (Diomedea antipodensis), both of which breed off New
   Zealand and are thought to range across the South Pacific Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{From 1995 through 1999, 2,240 individuals of 28 species of waterbirds
   were examined in the United States for ingested lead fishing weights. A
   combination of radiography and visual examination of stomachs was used
   to search for lead weights and blood and liver samples from live birds
   and carcasses, respectively, were collected for lead analysis. Ingested
   lead weights were found most frequently in the Common Loon (Gavia immer)
   (11 of 313 = 3.5\%) and Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) (10 of
   365 = 2.7\%), but also in one of 81 (1.2\%) Double-crested Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax auritus) and one of 11 (9.1 \%) Black-crowned Night
   Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax). Birds with ingested lead fishing weights
   (including split shot, jig heads, and egg, bell, and pyramid sinkers)
   were found in California, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
   and Wisconsin. The size and mass of ingested lead weights ranged from
   split shot of 7 turn in the longest dimension, weighing less than 2 g,
   to a 22 x 39 mm pyramid sinker that weighed 78.2 g. Six ingested lead
   weights were more than 25.4 mm in the longest dimension. Lead
   concentrations in the blood and liver of birds with lead fishing weights
   in their stomachs ranged up to 13.9 ppm and 26.0 ppm (wet weight basis),
   respectively. During the study, we also noted the presence of ingested
   or entangled fishing tackle, with no associated lead weights, in eight
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Within the Murray-Darling Basin of eastern Australia there has been a
   general decline in the abundance of wading birds. Loss of wetlands
   caused by river regulation and irrigated agriculture is considered to be
   the main cause. We assessed the adequacy of irrigated rice fields as
   substitutes for natural wetlands for foraging egrets during the breeding
   season in one study area around a mixed colony of egrets in southeast
   Australia. For aerially sown rice crops, which represented 85\% of all
   rice in the general area, the densities of foraging Intermediate Egret
   (Egretta intermedia) and Great Egret (Ardea alba) tended to reach a
   maximum four to six weeks after sowing of the rice crop, and declined
   thereafter. The decline phase was correlated with decreasing prey
   capture rates and a shift from vertebrate prey to less profitable
   invertebrate prey, and coincided with the start of the egrets' main
   chick rearing period when food demands would have been high. Even at
   maximum densities it was estimated that only 5-13\% of the Intermediate
   Egrets and Great Egrets that were available to feed actually did so in
   the rice growing areas within 6.5 km of the colony. In contrast, Cattle
   Egret (Bubulcus ibis) densities in rice fields did not decline until
   after their young fledged. They fed almost exclusively on insects and
   their prey capture rates showed no seasonal decrease. Up to 60\% of the
   available Cattle Egrets were found feeding in the rice fields within 6.5
   km of the colony. It is concluded that rice fields provide a good
   foraging habitat for the Cattle Egret and may be contributing to the
   spread of this invasive species, but that they are probably not a
   preferred foraging habitat for the Intermediate Egret and the Great
   Egret.}},

Abstract = {{According to habitat selection theory, individuals selecting among
   habitat patches should either avoid or be attracted to conspecifics.
   This study examined Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) foraging around two
   grazing horses (Equus caballus), which represented two distinct habitat
   patches. The numbers of Cattle Egrets in the two patches were not
   significantly different, and the egrets were regularly distributed
   between the two patches. When settling in the two patches, 66\% of the
   egrets selected the patch occupied by fewer conspecifics. All egrets
   choosing the patch occupied by more conspecifics did so only when the
   numbers of egrets in the two patches differed by one egret. When the
   numbers of egrets in the two patches differed by two or more egrets,
   newly arriving birds always chose the patch occupied by fewer
   conspecifics. As the number of egrets within a patch increased,
   nearest-neighbor distances decreased, and rates of aggression increased.
   Thus, these results indicate that the Cattle Egrets avoided conspecifics
   when selecting among habitat patches and that this distribution was
   achieved through individual patch selection decisions and density
   dependent aggression.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the food of breeding Great White Egrets (Ardea alba) in an
   agricultural ecosystem in southern Chile, South America. Analysis of
   diet was based oil prey remains and pellets collected under the nesting
   trees during the reproductive season. Pellets indicated that insects
   were the most numerous prey items (78\%), followed by the Southern
   Crayfish (Samastacus spinifrons) (21\%). The Southern Crayfish accounted
   for 92\% of the biomass. In terms of prey remains, the Southern Crayfish
   was the primary Prey item accounting for 97\% in frequency and 98\% of
   the biomass. When pellets and prey remains were combined, the Southern
   Crayfish remained the most numerous prey item (67\%), followed by
   insects (32\%). The other prey items constituted less than 1\%
   Significant differences were found between the diets estimated by the
   two methods. We suggest that results of pellets and prey remains should
   be combined to evaluate the diet of the Great White Egret.
   Significantly, more crustaceans and fewer insects were consumed during
   file late part compared with the early part of the breeding period, and
   differences were found amongst the orders of insects taken in the same
   periods. The food of the Great White Egrets is influenced both by
   spatial availability patterns and profitability of prey type.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the stomach contents of 64 male and 43 female Common Murres
   (Uria aalge) caught in gillnets during late chick rearing/early chick
   departure period in August 2002 near breeding colonies in Witless Bay,
   Newfoundland, Canada. Twenty-six percent of stomachs contained no food.
   All others contained exclusively fish, and Capelin (Mallotus villosus)
   was the only fish positively identified. Gravid female Capelin were
   found in 82\% of murre stomachs with contents. The number of fish
   ingested by murres differed between the sexes, with a mean of 2.7 fish
   in male stomachs and 1.6 fish in female stomachs. Mean mass of stomach
   contents did not differ between the sexes (males: 27.0 g; females: 22.6
   g). Overall, results were similar to Common Murre diets recorded in the
   1980s, despite changes in Capelin distribution and biology. The sample
   of Common Murres collected as gillnet bycatch was male-biased (59\%).
   Males may have been more vulnerable to being caught in gillnets, perhaps
   because they were engaged in different activities at this late stage of
   chick rearing.}},

Abstract = {{Winter breeding by Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) in
   l'Albufera de Valencia, during three consecutive years is described.
   Winter presence in the area was recorded since 1995 and winter breeding
   was first confirmed in February 2001. Nests were built at roosts in
   wooded areas on a barrier beach, using tall pine trees (Pinus
   halepensis). The number of birds attending the roosts ranged 100-200
   individuals, but only nine to eleven nests were built each year and only
   a few chicks survived to fledging. We suggest that the abundance of the
   introduced Red Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) increased food
   availability when rice field were ploughed in early winter. and mild
   temperatures may have encouraged Black-crowned Night Herons to extend
   their presence into the winter season and to permit egg laying into the
   winter months. Nevertheless, the extra food supplied during rice field
   operations declined markedly in March and may have forced nest
   desertions that month.}},

Abstract = {{The status of the Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was
   investigated in Peru after the 199798 El Ni (n) over tildeo event, the
   strongest of the last century. Penguin numbers along the southern and
   central coast of Peru (97\% of the total) did not differ significantly
   between 1999 and 2000; the average number was 4,425 individuals. In
   1999, the proportion of juveniles (one-year-old birds) was only 0.2\%
   compared with 7\% in 2000, probably as a result of the 1997-98 El Ni (n)
   over tildeo. Penguins were found from La Foca Island (5degrees12'S) to
   Punta Coles (17degrees42'S). However, the majority (78\%) were clustered
   in five localities, Punta San Juan (36\%), San Juanito Islet (11\%),
   Hornillos Island (10\%), Pachacamac Island (12\%) and Tres Puertas
   (9\%). The size and distribution of penguin colonies have changed over
   the last 15 years. Penguins have abandoned sites at Punta Corio,
   Sombrerillo and Morro Sama, and have decreased significantly in numbers
   in Punta San Fernando and Punta La Chira, where human disturbance has
   increased, mainly due to local fisheries activities. Penguins have
   increased at Punta San Juan, San Juanito Islet and San Gallan Island,
   all of which are partially protected. Half of the penguins were located
   in guano bird reserves, primarily at Punta San Juan. Guano bird reserves
   provide some protection against terrestrial predators and human
   disturbance; however, periodical guano extraction decreases their
   breeding success. Most penguin sites were found in inaccessible and
   marginal areas, which were vulnerable to occasional and unpredictable
   flooding from ocean swells. The methodology recommended by the
   Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for a consistent
   census of penguins in Peru and Chile during the molting period was
   validated at the Punta San Juan Reserve. Continued monitoring of
   Humboldt Penguin numbers is recommended in order to more fully
   understand patterns of fluctuation and to be able to detect changes of
   conservation concern as early as possible. Collaborative efforts between
   local authorities and conservation biologists are needed to monitor and
   protect this vulnerable species.}},

Abstract = {{In South Africa's Western Cape, the main breeding season of Hartlaub's
   Gull (Larus hartlaubii) is from January or February until May. At
   southern localities, there may be a second peak in breeding in August
   and September. Primary molt of adults mostly starts between August and
   December and lasts on average 115 days. In each of nine body
   measurements, averages were higher for males than for females, but
   values overlapped. In Western Cape during 1990-2001, the species bred at
   nine localities where breeding had not previously been reported. The
   maximum number recorded breeding at all localities in this region in any
   one year was about 5,500 pairs in 1995, less than the 10,000-11,000
   pairs estimated for the region in the 1980s. Because the timing of the
   peak in breeding varies from year to year, it is considered that the
   5,500 pairs represent an under-estimate, but it is likely that numbers
   did decrease after the 1980s. There are substantial inter-annual
   fluctuations in numbers of birds breeding, suggesting that in some years
   an appreciable proportion of the adults do not breed.}},

Abstract = {{To boost productivity in the Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus)
   breeding in the northern Great Plains, predator exclosure ``cages{''}
   constructed of wire mesh fence were placed over 1,355 plover nests on
   alkali lake beaches in Alberta, Saskatchewan, North Dakota, and Montana
   during 1993-2002. Nesting plovers were killed, apparently by raptors,
   near cages at 68 (5\%) of the nests. In contrast, no losses of adult
   plovers were detected at 420 nests that were not covered by cages. The
   predation was greatest (up to 48\% of applications) when small (1-1.7 m)
   diameter cages with wire mesh tops were used at sites with low (mean,
   4\%) or moderate (15\%) tree cover within two km. In areas with low tree
   cover, predation decreased to 0.7\% of applications/year when large (3-4
   m) diameter cages with soft netting tops replaced other designs. No
   predation was recorded in 393 applications of small cages at plover
   nests along the relatively treeless North Dakota-Montana border.
   Predator exclosure cages should be used cautiously for protecting eggs
   of endangered shorebirds. In some situations, enhanced productivity from
   use of the cages is outweighed by risks to adult birds.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive success of shorebirds can be improved by placement of
   predator exclosure fences along beaches or wire-mesh exclosure
   ``cages{''} over nests. We predicted that these two types of exclosures
   used simultaneously might further improve reproductive success over that
   when cages alone are used. Field experiments were carried out on Piping
   Plovers (Charadrius melodus) on prairie alkali lakes in North Dakota and
   Montana. During 1996 and 1997, we compared success of nesting plover
   pairs provided with: (1) no protection, (2) cages that protected eggs in
   individual nests from both mammalian and avian predators, and (3) a
   combination of cages plus a temporary electric fence that excluded
   mammalian predators from the entire nesting beach where chicks were
   being reared. In 20 replicated trials, fledgling production rates were:
   no protection, 0.72 chicks/pair (95\% CI: 0.29-1.15, N = 43 pairs); cage
   only, 1.73 (1.30-2.16, N = 46); fence plus cage, 2.06 (1.63-2.49, N =
   50). Production by protected pairs was significantly greater than for
   unprotected pairs. However, no significant difference in production was
   detected between the two protection types. Temporary electric fences
   were relatively expensive to apply and added little to the effectiveness
   of cages, but may be appropriate in situations where cages cannot be
   used or where mammalian predation on chicks is a greater threat.}},

Abstract = {{Acts of aggression by Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) adults on
   conspecific chicks were examined on Aride Island, Seychelles, from 13
   June-10 July 1998. Data were used to examine two hypotheses to explain
   adult aggression towards chicks: (1) the adoption avoidance hypothesis,
   and (2) the feeding unfamiliar chicks hypothesis. Throughout the entire
   nestling development, adults pecked mostly unattended chicks (96\%). The
   intensity of pecking was higher on b-chicks than on a-chicks and 72\% of
   the pecking acts were on chicks that were on their own nests. During
   each pecking act, young chicks (0-6 days) were pecked by a greater
   number of adults than were old chicks (>6 days). When pecked, young
   chicks moved significantly greater distances away from nests than did
   old chicks (1.41 +/- 1.92 m vs. 0.18 +/- 0.42 m). Of the 23 chicks
   killed by adults, 11 were a-chicks, representing 8.5\% of the a-chicks
   in the study area. Parents sometimes rescued a-chicks, but did not
   attempt to rescue b-chicks from adult attacks. Chicks that died had
   moved significantly greater distances away from nests than chicks that
   survived (2.8 2.5 m vs. 0.3 +/- 0.67 m). This study presents evidence
   that both hypotheses may be important in explaining intraspecific adult
   aggression by Roseate Terns on chicks. In particular, the feeding
   unfamiliar chicks hypothesis may be invoked to explain the significant
   negative correlation between daily intensity of adult aggression and the
   amount of food delivered to chicks. The adoption avoidance hypothesis
   may explain why b-chicks were disproportionately involved in pecking in
   relation to a-chicks. Adult aggression is an additive factor of chick
   mortality, operating mostly on days of food shortage.}},

Abstract = {{The White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) breeds in Alaska and
   Canada, and during the non-breeding season migrates to South America.
   The reported diet of this sandpiper is principally invertebrates; seeds
   are a very rare item. This species was studied at Guamini Pond, Buenos
   Aires Province, Argentina, in December 1997. The stomach contents of 23
   adults were investigated. The analysis showed that during the sampling
   period the only food eaten by the White-rumped Sandpiper were seeds.
   Them were represented by the following families: Caryophylaceae,
   Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Polygonaceae, Ulmaceae, Cyperaceae
   and Poaceac. The seeds ranged between 0.83 and 2.25 mm in length. Stones
   and fragments of algae were found in all samples, the algae possibly
   ingested accidentally during feeding. Our findings indicate that the
   White-rumped Sandpiper forages on different items depending on the area,
   season and availability, and may be an opportunistic feeder.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 70 years, three counts have been conducted on the
   Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) population on the Falkland
   Islands during the 1932/33, 1995/96 and 2000/01 breeding seasons. The
   results indicated a population decrease of more than 90\% during this
   period, from more than three million breeding pairs in 1932/33 to less
   than 300,000 breeding pairs in the mid-1990s. However, a re-evaluation
   of these data revealed that the original population was substantially
   overestimated and the 1930s numbers were probably closer to 1.5 million
   breeding pairs. Modifications to the mid-1990s data produce a revised
   population estimate of about 263,000, rather than 297,000 breeding
   pairs. Based on these revised values, the overall decrease in the
   Rockhopper Penguin at the Falkland Islands between 1932 and 1995 still
   exceeded 80\%, at a rate of ca. 2.75\% per annum. In the most recent
   census, the population was estimated to be 272,000 breeding pairs,
   suggesting a stable population since the mid 1990s. These
   re-calculations of historical Rockhopper Penguin population trends in
   the Falkland Islands have important implications for the assessment of
   the global population size and long-term trends of this species.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the habitat requirements and nest site characteristics of
   Imperial Cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) and Rock Shags (P.
   magellanicus) in northern Golfo San Jorge, Argentina. Colonies of both
   species were only located on islands. We characterized nesting habitat
   at 15 and 31 islands with and without Imperial Cormorant colonies, and
   19 and 27 islands with and without Rock Shag colonies, respectively. The
   probability of finding nesting cormorants and shags was independent of
   island size. Both cormorants and shags nested on only 18\% of islands or
   islets closer than one km to the mainland, but nested in between 35\%
   and 52\% of islands located further offshore. All Imperial Cormorant and
   Rock Shag colonies were located on bare, rocky substrate. All colonies
   of both species were located more than 50 m from shrubs. The mean slope
   of the substrate where colonies were located was significantly greater
   for Rock Shags than for Imperial Cormorants (73degrees vs. 3degrees).
   Orientation of cliffs and steep slopes where Rock Shags nested was
   mostly to the east. Over 86\% of Imperial Cormorant colonies were
   located on the side of the island facing the open sea. Both height and
   depth of the nest were significantly larger for the Rock Shag, while
   internal diameter was significantly larger for Imperial Cormorant nests.
   The distribution patterns of cormorants and shags at the northern sector
   of Golfo San Jorge appears to be largely determined by the presence of
   islands, with availability of open rocky substrate and low shrub
   vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{Although there have been several studies of the foraging behavior of the
   Imperial Cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps) and the Rock Shag
   (Phalacrocorax magellanicus), none document the feeding performance and
   the use of feeding areas by these birds breeding in mixed or adjacent
   colonies. We studied birds nesting sympatrically in two colonies at
   Malaspina Inlet, Patagonia, Argentina. Both colonies were located on
   islands separated by 2.2 km: Vernacci Oeste, inside Malaspina Inlet and
   Vernacci Este at the mouth of the inlet. Rock Shags from both islands
   and Imperial Cormorants from Vernacci Oeste fed inside the inlet, and
   showed similar dive duration, surface interval and foraging range.
   Imperial Cormorants from Vernacci Este foraged outside the inlet and
   showed longer dive duration, surface interval and foraging range.
   Imperial Cormorants made longer foraging trips than Rock Shags (4.9 +/-
   1.9 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.7 h) regardless of its colony. There was no overlap
   between the foraging areas used by Imperial Cormorants from the two
   colonies. Despite Rock Shags from both islands feeding inside the inlet,
   there was a little overlap in their foraging locations (3-22\%). Rock
   Shags and Imperial Cormorants breeding in the same colony showed an
   overlap in their foraging areas, being lower at Vernacci Este than at
   Vernacci Oeste. Although both species are usually described as having
   different diving capacities, we found that their diving behavior was
   similar when feeding in areas of similar environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Food intake (fish biomass), during the winters of 1997-98 and 1998-99,
   by Great Crested Grebes (Podiceps cristatus) on a 47 km(2) area of the
   western basin of Lake Como, North Italy, was estimated by analyzing
   recognizable remains of the fish prey in the stomach contents of birds
   found dead. Using the size of otoliths and pharyngeal bones, we showed
   that grebes mainly ate the younger age-classes (2-yr. old and younger)
   of Bleak (Alburnus alburnus), 80\% of all fish prey. Monthly rates of
   Bleak consumption by wintering grebes were estimated by multiplying
   daily food intake, extrapolated from the relationship between food
   biomass intake and water temperature in the different winter months,
   with the proportion of Bleak in the diet and with the number of
   wintering grebes present each month. Great Crested Grebes were most
   numerous in the study area in January-February and there were no
   significant differences in numbers between the two winters. Size of
   Bleak eaten increased from November to February and the biomass of Bleak
   consumed was highest at the end of winter, when water temperature was
   lowest. Overall in the western basin, grebes consumed between 640 kg
   (conservative estimate) and 1,000 kg (maximum estimate) of Bleak per
   winter, which corresponded to 10\% to 20\% of the annual commercial
   Bleak harvest in that area. We suggest that grebe predation on Bleak
   might increase the mortality rates in the younger age-classes of the
   fish, and thus contribute to a decrease in the stock, but that economic
   impact of grebe predation on gross annual income from the local fishery
   is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland use was studied in the Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps)
   and Horned Grebe (Podiceps auritus) in southwestern Manitoba during
   April to August of 1997. Of the 180 wetlands surveyed, 74 had no grebe
   use, six were sporadically used by either grebe species, 19 were
   consistently used by Horned Grebe, nine switched from Horned Grebe to
   Pied-billed Grebe use, none switched from Pied-billed Grebe to Horned
   Grebe use, 68 were consistently used by Pied-billed Grebe, one was
   regularly used by both species but at different times, and three were
   concurrently used by both species throughout the breeding season.
   Wetlands used by grebes were larger, deeper, and had more vegetated area
   than wetlands not used by grebes, wetlands where occupancy changed were
   larger, deeper, and had more vegetated area than wetlands consistently
   used by one species, and wetlands that were concurrently used by both
   species were larger, deeper, and had more vegetated area than wetlands
   used by only one species at a time. Five logistic regression models were
   used to model the probability of observing a grebe brood as a function
   of the habitat characteristics of the wetland, grebe species, and their
   interaction. The three best models all contained a parameter describing
   the habitat characteristics of the wetlands. In two of the three best
   models, the probability of observing a grebe brood increased with
   increased wetland size, depth, and vegetated area. These results
   indicate that habitat characteristics influence breeding quality of a
   wetland and that grebes may be competing for high quality wetlands in
   this study area.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the basic biology of the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its
   interactions with the waterbird colonies in the Ebro Delta natural park,
   Spain. Dens (earths) were found in areas characterized by sandy dune
   vegetation, a few buildings, areas where human entry was prohibited, and
   areas where hunting of waterfowl was banned. Regression associated the
   presence of dens to the abundance of dunes, halophytic vegetation and
   prohibited entry. Birds constituted 96\% of the prey found at dens,
   mainly waterfowl (68\%), gulls (16\%) and rails (10\%), but this
   differed markedly between areas. During the breeding season, foxes
   obtained their food from a reduced number of sources in the area
   surrounding their dens, and impacted the nearest breeding birds. We
   propose changes in the management of foxes in the natural park to
   safeguard internationally threatened bird species and to prevent them
   from decreasing, or even disappearing, as a result of fox predation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are increasingly occupying the margins of estuarine
   wetlands. Consequently, it becomes important to understand how the
   presence of these urban areas influences the use of adjacent intertidal
   habitats by waterbirds. Wintering waterbirds were regularly counted on
   28 mudflat sectors along the northern margin of the river Tagus estuary,
   Portugal, which includes large urbanized extensions. Sectors were
   characterized using 16 variables related to its physical characteristics
   and human influence and related to bird density and diversity using
   multiple linear regression. Species richness was positively influenced
   by wider mudflats and a margin covered with saltmarsh. The individual
   response of seven of the most abundant bird species to these variables
   differed between species, but the abundance of half of these species was
   significantly influenced by variables potentially related to the
   presence of urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relationship between number of wetlands and occurrence
   of five waterbird and one waterfowl species in the Prairie Pothole
   Region of North Dakota, USA, from 1980-2000. Data from 13 Breeding Bird
   Survey routes provided an index to regional density and distribution of
   Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Black Tern (Chlidonias niger),
   American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta),
   Sora (Porzana carolina), and American Coot (Fulica. americana), while 69
   segments from annual Waterfowl Breeding Ground Population and Habitat
   Surveys provided an index to regional wetland availability. Numbers of
   wetlands and birds varied among years, and density and distribution of
   all six species showed a strong positive correlation with number of
   wetlands. Correlations were weaker when the number of wetlands was
   lagged one year, suggesting that waterbird distributions shift in
   response to water availability rather than respond locally. Spatial and
   temporal variation of waterbird habitat and numbers should be considered
   in monitoring and management of waterbirds in the Prairie Pothole
   Region.}},

Abstract = {{Wading bird nesting colonies were surveyed in the Upper St. Johns River
   Basin, east central Florida, USA in 1993-1995 and 1998-2000 using aerial
   survey methods. A total of 62 colony locations were found over six
   years, with a maximum of 35 sites active in each of two years. Borrow
   pits and managed impoundments were the most important nesting locations
   based on size and persistence. Most of these sites were in or adjacent
   to the Upper St. Johns River Basin Project, a wetland restoration
   project. Higher numbers of nests were counted during nesting seasons
   preceded by above average rainfall than during seasons characterized by
   drought. Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) were the most common nesting
   species in all years, however, the proportion of the total nests that
   were Cattle Egrets decreased over the study period. Wood Storks
   (Mycteria americana), a federally endangered species, nested in
   increasing numbers within three borrow pits adjacent to the Upper St.
   Johns River Basin Project. This study reveals the importance of borrow
   pits, most of which are on private land where sites are unprotected, to
   wading bird nesting in east central Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Many birds with colored dorsal plumage have white underparts and among
   waterbirds extensive white plumage is common. Feathers are made of
   keratin, which is naturally transparent and colorless. They appear white
   because keratin foam or fibers scatter all frequencies of the visible
   spectrum. Colored feathers have keratin structures that reflect light
   selectively or mechanisms for depositing pigment within feathers. Color
   is not essential for flight, streamlining, insulation or waterproofing;
   some of the largest birds fly and breed successfully with all-white
   plumage. Adaptive scenarios concerned with camouflage, communication and
   thermoregulation have been based upon the visual properties of white
   feathers. These are discussed, but few examples are convincing enough to
   falsify the hypothesis that feathers may be white by default. Arctic
   land birds provide evidence for cryptic white plumage, but some white
   feathers are retained after they cease to be cryptic. White plumage also
   occurs in some tropical land birds.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed the shoreline of a large terminal lake in southern
   Saskatchewan (Old Wives Lake) for sick or dead birds and estimated
   shorebird numbers during avian botulism outbreaks. Nearly double the
   number of shorebirds were present in 1999 compared with 1998. The most
   commonly observed shorebirds in both years were the Short-billed
   Dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus) and Long-billed Dowitcher (L.
   scolopaceus). Water levels were monitored, revealing a greater drawdown
   effect in 1998. Small species (e.g. Least Sandpiper (Calidris
   minutilla), Semipalmated Sandpiper (C. pusilla), and Sanderling (C.
   alba)) were much more common in 1998. Much of the data that exist on
   shorebird mortality during botulism kills is in the form of unpublished
   annual agency clean-up reports. These reports suggest that the American
   Avocet (Recurvirostra americana), yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca and T.
   flavipes), and the small Calidris sandpipers are the most commonly
   affected species. We suggest some biases inherent in these cleanup
   efforts that may unintentionally underestimate mortality due to botulism
   in some species of shorebirds. At Old Wives Lake, the most frequently
   affected shorebird was the Semipalmated Sandpiper (14) in 1998, and the
   American Avocet (5) in 1999. This study suggests that feeding habits may
   influence a species' susceptibility to botulism, namely those species
   that feed near the surface of the substrate are more prone to ingesting
   the botulinal toxin than those species which probe deeply in the
   sediment. There is also evidence suggesting that the intensity of the
   avian botulism outbreak affecting waterfowl may dictate the intensity of
   the shorebird botulism die-off.}},

Abstract = {{Social foraging in waterbirds in Ghanaian coastal lagoons was studied
   during October and November 1994. Two types of foraging were social:
   directionally synchronized flocks (often involving distinctive feeding
   methods used in unison) and dense pecking aggregations. Social flocks
   were typically larger and denser than non-social flocks, and primarily
   involved piscivorous birds, especially the longer-legged shorebirds and
   egrets. It is probable that the flocks concentrate fish into temporarily
   high densities through herding or confusing escape reactions. We suggest
   that these flocks, rather than simply forming in areas of existing high
   prey density, may actively enhance their foraging success. There may be
   a true social element to either the initiation of persistence of
   waterbird social foraging flocks in coastal Ghana.}},

   examined at four nesting colonies along the Lower Mississippi River

   productivity and evaluate reproductive status. Nesting colonies varied
   in size from 172 to 550 nests, with average clutch sizes ranging from
   1.9-2.7 eggs/nest. Both nest success, the proportion of nests from which
   at minimum one egg hatched, and hatching success, the proportion of eggs
   that hatched, were significantly higher in 1995 (97\% and 94\%
   respectively) as compared to 1996 and 1997 (similar to40\%).
   Reproductive success averaged between 0.28-1.27 fledglings/clutch.
   Predation and untimely flooding were the largest negative impacts upon

Abstract = {{During 1987-2000, the numbers of Swift Terns (Sterna bergii) breeding in
   South Africa's Western Cape varied between 1,449 and 5,668 pairs,
   distributed at 13 localities. Numbers were significantly related to the
   combined biomass of Anchovy (Engraulis capensis) and Sardine (Sardinops
   sagax), two of the main food items. In years when food was scarce,
   numbers breeding decreased by up to 67\%. The sizes of breeding
   aggregations of Swift Terns were significantly related to the combined
   biomass of Anchovy and Sardine. Numbers of Swift Terns breeding at a
   locality ranged from 1-4,192 pairs, with an average of 750. Numbers
   breeding in discrete colonies ranged from 13,000 pairs, with an average
   of 513. Swift Terns showed low fidelity to breeding areas, 61\% of which
   were used just once. This is attributed to their requirement to breed
   near to fish prey, and its variable distribution front year to year.
   Breeding by other seabirds probably often indicated safe sites for
   nesting. Swift Terns bred by themselves in 17\%, with Hartlaub's Gulls
   (Lams hartlaubii) in 77\%, and with Crowned Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   coronatus) in 18\% of breeding attempts.}},

   northern Italy, are often inaccessible. We describe an easy-to-build,
   cheap and efficient technique to collect pellets at inaccessible roosts,
   which enabled us to study the diet of cormorants without causing
   disturbance, or killing birds. A floating platform was built using iron
   bars, sea-plywood panels and plastic tanks which was placed on the
   lake's surface, to collect pellets ejected by cormorants rising a roost
   on the eastern shore of the western basin of Lake Como. During two
   winter periods (February 2001-March 2001 and December 2001-March 2002)
   106 samples were retrieved from the platform, measuring 17.5 m(2).}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We assessed reliability of plumage as an indicator of age class in the
   Surf Scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) for demographic and behavioral
   studies. Three age classes were distinguished among finale Surf Scoters,
   based on the degree of concordance between plumage characteristics and
   known age-related features (bursal depth and tail feather notching).
   Males in their first year (1Y) were distinguishable from older males
   (>1Y) with nearly total accuracy. Discriminating between second year
   (2Y) and after second year (>2Y) males had an error rate of 11\%. Female
   Surf Scoters could not be reliably aged using plumage characteristics.
   Field observations suggested the timing of feather changes is an
   important variable affecting accurate age class determination. First
   year male Surf Scoter plumage is brown and female-like at the tune of
   fledging, and gradually becomes more adult male-like during the first
   year. Observations of plumage changes throughout the annual cycle on
   wild birds suggested that females and 1Y males may be confused in early
   autumn, and that 1Y males and 2Y males may be misidentified during late
   spring and summer. Further, variation in tuning and speed of pre- and
   post-breeding molt among 2Y and older males is uncertain. Therefore,
   mid-January until the end of March is the period when age class
   determinations based on plumage are most reliable.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-71}},

Abstract = {{We studied nightly movement rates, behavior, flight directions, and
   flight altitudes of Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and
   possibly Newell's Shearwater (Puffinus auricularis) at 75 sites on Maui,
   Hawaiian Islands, in June 2001. W e observed no Newell's Shear waters
   visually, but saw Hawaiian Petrels at all of the nine sites around
   eastern Maui and at two of the six sites around western Maui. Mean
   nightly movement rates on radar generally were higher in eastern Maui
   than western Main, although movement rates in the northeastern part of
   western Maui were comparable to those at several sites in eastern Maui.
   file highest movement rates occurred at the Ke'anae Valley, Mokuia
   Point, Nu'u Bay, and Kanpo sites, all of which are located on the
   northeastern or southeastern slopes of Haleakala in eastern Maui.
   Hawaiian Petrels (identified visually) flew inland primarily between 10
   min after sunset and the point of complete darkness (about 30 min after
   sunset), with do movements observed beyond 50 nun after sunset. Radar
   movements peaked just before the point of complete darkness, but a
   substantial number of radar targets also flew inland at 30-50 min after
   sunset, with some movement occurring even after that period. These later
   movements suggest that small numbers of Newell's Shearwaters are flying
   inland at several locations. Further, there was a higher proportion of
   these late flights in western Maui than in eastern Maui, suggesting that
   Newell's Shearwaters, if present, form a higher proportion of the two
   species in western Maui than in eastern Maui. Mean flight directions at
   all sites were in an inland direction, with little variation in flight
   directions at most sites. Mean flight altitudes of the Hawaiian Petrel
   were 190 to above ground level, similar to those at Kaua'i Island. The
   data suggest that the number of Hawaiian Petrels on Maui may be higher
   than the current estimate of 1,800 birds.}},

Abstract = {{A voluntary waterfowl avoidance area (VWAA) was established on Lake
   Onalaska in Navigation Pool 7 of the Upper Mississippi River, Wisconsin,
   USA, in 1986, to reduce boating disturbance to migratory waterfowl. We
   monitored boater compliance with the VWAA program in 1993 and 1997. Of
   1,664 ``boating events{''} observed on Lake Onalaska, boats intruded
   into the VWAA on 127 occasions. Boating events have increased from 1.82
   boating events/h in 1986-88 to 1.97 in 1993 and 2.58 in 1997. Despite a
   60\% increase in boating traffic, the lake-wide disturbance rates in
   1997 were comparable to that in 1981. We attribute this to a significant
   reduction in the proportion of lake-wide boating events that resulted in
   disturbance, a direct consequence of the VWAA program. Rate of intrusion
   into the VWAA was 0.11 per boating event in 1997 compared to 0.18 per
   boating event in 1986-88. Boating disturbances to waterfowl within the
   VWAA occurred at about half the rate (0.24 to 0.28 disturbances (.)
   hr(-1)) observed prior to establishment of the program (0.48
   disturbances (.) hr(-1)). We also identified access points used by
   boaters and boating activities that were most likely to result in
   intrusion into the VWAA and associated disturbance to waterfowl. Results
   of these analyses have provided useful information to resource managers
   for targeting public education efforts. The VWAA program has contributed
   to the value of Lake Onalaska as a waterfowl refuge and demonstrates an
   effective collaboration among government agencies and non-governmental
   organizations.}},

Abstract = {{We document timing and location of wing molt in the Horned Grebe
   (Podiceps auritus), Red-necked Grebe (Podiceps grisegena), and Western
   Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis). Horned Grebes left breeding ponds in
   late May to August and were observed on large ponds and lakes (near
   breeding locations) where they replaced remiges before progressing to
   wintering areas in September and October. Red-necked Grebes moved to
   much larger bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the coast
   following breeding and prior to molt. On the Pacific Coast, Boundary
   Bay, British Columbia was identified as a major molt site. Freshwater
   molting areas were identified around Manitoulin Island in northern Lake
   Huron. On the Atlantic coast, molt sites were located in the Gulf of St.
   Lawrence. Western Grebes were found in wing molt at both large
   freshwater lakes and coastal locations (including Boundary Bay, British
   Columbia). Like the Great Crested Grebe (P. cristatus) and Eared Grebe
   (P. nigicollis), Horned, Red-necked and Western Grebes move to special
   molt locations following breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The Red-necked Grebe (Podiceps grisegena) is a species in which breeding
   pairs use both overt aggression and ritualistic behavior to defend
   territories for breeding and feeding. However in some areas, they also
   breed in colonial groups. The behavior of grebes breeding on a single
   large lake (2,537 ha), where some breed solitarily and others breed in
   colonies, was examined. Specifically, I compared the frequency and
   spatial distribution of behavioral interactions between pairs that had
   dispersed nests with those breeding in close proximity. Grebes breeding
   in a colony engaged in more overt behavioral interactions and spent more
   time conducting platform behavior during pre-nesting than their solitary
   counterparts. In addition, the locations of ritualized and overt
   interactions from the nest were greater for solitary breeders. However,
   grebes breeding in the colony tolerated conspecifics at closer distances
   which, suggests that those breeding in higher aggregations may expend
   more energy when dealing with conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998 and 1999, the costs of experimentally extending incubation among
   female Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) were examined in relation to
   changes in female body mass. Clutches were switched between nests to
   extend incubation by an average of five days to compare with control
   clutches. In the four days prior to hatch, females with manipulated
   clutches incubated less per day, and lost more body mass than control
   females. The probability of nest failure was similar for control and
   manipulated females. Manipulated females who lost their clutches to
   predation or abandonment appeared to have greater body mass than those
   who hatched their eggs successfully. Manipulated females who were
   unsuccessful also took more frequent incubation recesses than those who
   hatched eggs successfully. The probability of return to the colony in
   the following year did not differ significantly between control (66\%)
   and manipulated females (57\%). These results suggest that some female
   Common Eiders breeding in the arctic can physically increase their
   incubation effort and decrease their body condition at the end of the
   breeding season with no major consequences to long-term survival.}},

Abstract = {{The assumption that brood patches identify incubating birds is a
   pervasive one in avian literature, and its a result, brood patches are
   often used to infer breeding status. Although the developmental stages
   of the brood patch with specific: reproductive stages in passerines have
   been described, this information for seabirds is not often reported.
   Thus, for birds whose breeding activities are not easily observed, it is
   difficult to confirm (1) that it is valid to assume that a bird which
   has some stage of brood patch is a nester or putative nester, and (2)
   whether specific stages of brood patch development reflect specific
   stages of the breeding cycle. We tested the utility oh brood patch
   scores to infer breeding status in a non-colonial seabird, the Marbled
   Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), a species always captured away from
   the nest site. We confirmed the breeding status of murrelets with brood
   patches, and assessed the specific stages of brood patch development to
   the timing of egg-production (using a physiological analysis) and the
   onset of incubation (rising radio telemetry). Murrelets with brood
   patches were not always nesters or putative nesters (58\% of birds with
   brood patches were producing eggs, and 56\% of radio-tagged birds with
   brood patches began incubation), and brood patch score did not predict
   which birds were more likely to become egg-producers or incubators.
   Specific brood patch stages did not always correlate with specific
   breeding stages (e.g., the brood patch of egg-producers ranged from
   absent to fully-developed). Birds with fully developed brood patches
   took from 3-30 days to start incubation. Brood patch development
   accurately depicted the average population incubation time, but we
   caution against rising brood patches to predict the timing of an
   individual breeding attempt, and suggest that when possible, researchers
   should try to confirm breeding activities using other methods.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of anthropogenically-caused salinization on wildlife is a
   conservation issue of global concern. Increasing salinization of inland
   wetlands is especially problematic for breeding and migrating birds. In
   the arid American west, inland wetlands are centers of avian
   biodiversity, providing habitat for millions of birds. We experimentally
   examined the effects of different salinity levels on the growth, health
   and behavior of American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) chicks. Birds
   raised in highly saline conditions exhibited significant changes in
   behavior, including increased activity and decreased feeding and
   preening. High salinity resulted in significant weight loss of 4.4 g by
   day 3. Blood measures of chick health indicated that hypersaline-raised
   chicks suffered from dehydration (e.g., osmolality of chicks reared in
   brackish water was 305, compared with 381 among chicks reared in
   hypersaline water). Results of this study, and similar studies on ducks,
   geese and egrets, indicate that waterbirds in general suffer adverse
   effects when living in highly saline environments, without access to
   freshwater. We recommend that water managers ensure the maintenance of
   freshwater inflows to wetlands throughout the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding and vigilance behavior of the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa
   limosa) were studied in an intertidal area of the Ria de Huelva, Spain,
   during the autumn migration. During diurnal low-tide periods, feeding
   was the predominant activity (80-85\% of birds sampled). No significant
   negative relationship was observed between conspecific density and
   vigilance variables, and this may be related to the increases observed
   with group size in the intraspecific aggression and probe rates. The
   godwits showed greater vigilance in the presence of Black-headed Gulls
   (Larus ridibundus), possibly because of the kleptoparasitic activity of
   this species. The godwits ingested more worms during the period around
   low tide and fewer prey items when the air temperature was rising. The
   feeding rate did not decrease with the conspecific density.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines predatory threats to Piping Plovers (Charadrius
   melodus) nesting at Breezy Point, Gateway National Recreation Area, New
   York. Several methods used include: 1) an evaluation of reproductive
   success data with documentation of predation to eggs and chicks, 2)
   predator surveys, and 3) an artificial nest study. The range of breeding
   pairs nesting from 1988-1996 was 11-19, with an average of 15.8 (SE +/-
   0.79) pairs/season. The average number of eggs hatched and chicks
   fledged per year for pairs was 2.2 +/- 0.23 and 0.8 +/- 0,16
   respectively. Reasons for egg losses often went undetected (68\%) but
   known sources included: tidal flooding (2\%), human disturbance (4\%),
   and predation (26\%). Reasons for chick loss were generally not detected
   (99\%). For eggs in artificial nests, overall egg removal was 84\% and
   the two main predators based on visible footprints in sand were avian:
   gulls and crows. Results suggested that gulls predated significantly
   fewer eggs at artificial nests than crows, although they were more
   numerous in the area. With artificial nests, the highest egg removal
   occurred at a gull colony (100\%), although losses were similarly high
   on adjacent beaches and at interior locations (greater than 90\%).
   During the nesting season, highest removal occurred early in the field
   season (April-93\%) when nesting Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), which
   mob potential predators, had yet to arrive. Once terns arrived, rates of
   egg loss at artificial nests in their colony were significantly lower
   than that at other habitats. It is suggested that crow control,
   including nest removal, be added to the existing management plan that
   already involves gull control.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial surveys of American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos)
   were conducted over coastal Louisiana and the delta region of
   Mississippi on 1-2 days during December, February, and April each year
   from 1997 to 1999. Additional surveys were conducted in coastal Texas
   and Mexico during January, v 1998 and 1999. The numbers, location, and
   habitat of all pelicans observed were recorded. The coastal zone of
   Louisiana consistently had higher numbers of pelicans (18,000 to 35,000
   birds) than other areas surveyed (3,000 to 8,000 birds), indicating that
   Louisiana may be the most important wintering area for American White
   Pelicans east of the Rocky Mountains. Among the four regions surveyed,
   the average size of pelican flocks was largest in Mississippi during
   January-February, particularly in 1999 ((x) over bar - 245 birds/flock).
   Pelican numbers in Mississippi peaked in February but in Louisiana they
   were more variable. Pelicans in the delta region of Mississippi were
   found most often in fresh water and sand bar habitats during December,
   flooded field habitats during February, and catfish ponds in April. In
   Louisiana, pelicans used fresh, intermediate, and brackish marshes
   during Deccmber, but showed a preference for brackish and saline marshes
   in February and April.}},

Abstract = {{The food of immature White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) feeding in meadows

   However, by biomass, 58\% of food consisted of small mammals, mainly
   voles Microtus sp. Insects (22\%) and earthworms (11.5\%) were secondary
   resources. Literature on White Stork diet in Europe also showed that
   voles, insects and earthworms were the dominant food of breeding White
   Storks. Their roles changed with latitude, habitat, time, as well as
   method of data analysis. Generally, the diet of non-breeding storks was
   similar to breeding birds, but more of the prey was obtained in dry

Abstract = {{We documented roosting and foraging habitat use by Wood Storks during
   the post-breeding season in the coastal zone of Georgia from 1994-1998.
   Larger, more persistent aggregations of roosting storks typically
   occurred in enclosed wetlands on large estuarine islands. Smaller, more
   ephemeral aggregations tended to occur on salt marsh/upland ecotones,
   where storks appeared to be waiting for local conditions (tide levels)
   to become suitable for foraging. Examination of habitat types within a
   2-km radius of the larger (mean > 10 storks/survey) vs. smaller (mean
   <10 storks/survey) roosts showed that surrounding habitat structure,
   including those used for foraging, were similar. Foraging storks
   typically fed in close proximity (median = 0.5 km) to large roosts, much
   closer than storks using coastal wetlands during the breeding season.
   Tidal creeks were used almost exclusively as foraging habitat (92\%).
   Storks and other wading birds were almost always present when the study
   bird arrived. The foraging patterns of study birds and four storks
   carrying radios suggested that storks often used the same foraging sites
   and/ or marsh systems in the non-breeding season. Coastal Wood Storks
   apparently selected roosting sites based on the presence of
   conspecifics, abundant local prey, or possibly as shelter from adverse
   weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the kleptoparasitic behavior of ten adult Roseate Terns
   (Sterna dougathi) breeding at a colony at Falkner Island, Connecticut,
   USA between 1995 and 1998. These birds were considered habitual
   kleptoparasites because they stole fish repeatedly from other terns in
   every year they were observed at the site. No other breeding individuals
   were observed attempting to steal fish during our study. Kleptoparasitic
   techniques included aerial piracy, ground-based attacks, and deceptive
   behavior, but with one exception, each individual used one method
   exclusively. Success varied among individuals, but overall,
   kleptoparasites obtained prey at a significantly higher rate than did
   ``honest{''} foragers. Eight of the ten kleptoparasites were females,
   suggesting a sex-biased tendency in Roseate Terns to engage in this
   behavior. Our observations indicate that kleptoparasitism by Roseate
   Terns is a specialized behavior, used regularly by only a few
   individuals at this breeding colony. This conclusion is consistent with
   a recent theoretical prediction regarding kleptoparasitism in birds.}},

Abstract = {{In the east Atlantic during the latter part of the 20th century, small
   colonies of Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) grew at a faster rate than
   big ones. In this species, colony growth occurs largely at the
   perimeter. Hence, the relative growth rate of a colony should be
   inversely proportional to the square root of its size. Data from 34
   colonies confirmed this expectation. Modelling based on observed
   population parameters suggested that small colonies could sustain their
   faster growth rate only by recruiting birds from other colonies.
   Conversely, while large colonies grew more slowly, they reared more
   young than they could recruit. This implied net movement of young birds
   from big colonies to small ones, and showed how a population of gannets
   could sustain fast growth by founding new colonies.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a satellite transmitter attachment technique for adult
   Common Loons (Gavia immer) that would help in identifying important
   migration routes, staging areas, and the location of wintering grounds
   of birds that breed in the north central United States. During the
   autumn and winter of 1998, the migration of six adult loons that were
   radio marked in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota was monitored. The
   results of this work offer insight into autumn movement patterns of
   Common Loons. Timing of autumn staging and migration to wintering
   grounds appeared to be related to low pressure systems that delivered
   winter weather to the Upper Midwest. Most of the radiomarked birds
   staged on the Great Lakes and then followed one of two distinct
   migration routes to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. Several of
   the birds used lakes and reservoirs in the southeastern United States
   during migration. This study provides a basis for more extensive studies
   of Common Loon migration.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between wetland water conditions and breeding numbers
   of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta),
   Blue-winged Teal (A. discors), and Northern Shoveler (A. clypeata)
   during May of 1992-1995, were examined on twelve study areas in the
   eastern Prairie Pothole Region. Data were collected on water levels (by
   wetland class {[}temporary, seasonal, semipermanent]), pond density
   (density of wet basins), and numbers of indicated pairs for each species
   from weekly roadside transect surveys. Comparison of models relating
   duck numbers to wetlands using Akaike's Information Criterion indicated
   that measures of water condition generally were of similar value for
   explaining duck numbers. The model containing effects of semipermanent
   wetland water levels was among the best in explaining duck numbers for
   all species. Inclusion of temporary and seasonal wetland water levels in
   models for Mallard and Northern Pintail was not strongly supported by
   the data. Variation in duck numbers was much higher among areas than
   among years. Water conditions accounted for nearly all among-year
   variation for individual sites, but a large proportion of residual
   variation remained unexplained. Water condition measures (excluding
   spatial and temporal factors) explained 9-49\% of variation in duck
   numbers, leaving 51-91\% unexplained. Comparisons of these results to
   those of studies conducted at local or regional scale indicated that the
   relationship between duck numbers and pond numbers varied with scale,
   and suggested that other area-related factors should be considered at
   smaller landscape scales.}},

Abstract = {{The Port of Long Beach is currently developing the former U.S. Naval
   Station Long Beach into a marine container terminal. When the Naval
   Station was operational, a large Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) colony (tip to 500 pairs) occupied mature Indian Laurel
   (Ficus microcarpa) and Olive (Olea europaea) trees that lined the
   Station streets. Although Black-crowned Night Herons are abundant
   throughout southern California, a nesting colony of this size is
   unusual. As part of air agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Port agreed to relocate
   the colony prior to construction of the terminal. In 1999, 50 mature
   Indian Laurel, Olive, and Paperbark (Melaleuca sp.) trees were boxed and
   transported to a location in the port approximately, two kin from the
   original site. The relocated trees supplemented approximately 70 trees
   and bushes already at the location, formerly a park. Black-crowned Night
   Heron decoys were placed in the trees, heron vocalizations recorded from
   the original colony site were played twice per day, an public access to
   the site was eliminated. Three years of monitoring have shown that
   nesting has been successful and has increased at the relocation site; in
   2000, 1,128 voting were produced from 423 nests. Three years remain in
   the monitoring plan. No other documented relocation of an entire
   Black-crowned Night Heron colony of this size is recorded.}},

Abstract = {{Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) show little sexual
   dimorphism, and although males are usually larger than females, sexing
   by direct observation may be difficult, especially in the case of
   chicks. In this paper we evaluate the utility of four different
   PCR-based sex determination techniques using genomic DNA for sexing
   Magellanic Penguins. We found that the primer set designed for sex
   determination in Collared Flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) also provided
   a reliable, simple and convenient sexing procedure for Magellanic
   Penguins. Additionally, we obtained discriminant functions for sexing
   adults and chicks, sampled at six colonies differing in size and other
   ecological characteristics. Discriminant function for adults used two
   variables, bill length and bill depth that correctly classified 97\% of
   the birds. Discriminant function for chicks included bill length and
   flipper length and correctly classified 78\% of the individuals.
   Although molecular and biometric approaches could be useful for sexing
   adult Magellanic Penguins, only molecular procedures proved appropriate
   for accurately sexing chicks.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturized temperature loggers placed in Red-necked Grebe (Podiceps
   grisegina) nests revealed that 16 of the 32 monitored pairs abandoned
   their nests for extended periods lasting 3-9 h during at least two of
   the three nights that they were monitored. When incubating pairs left
   their nests unattended, temperatures of the thermistored egg usually
   dropped precipitously to below 30degreesC within 15-25 min. Duration of
   a pair's incubation period was positively associated with the number of
   minutes that the thermistored egg was below 30degreesC in our 3-day
   samples, yet nesting success remained high. Embryos appeared to be
   tolerant of this cooling; 26 of the 32 monitored nests hatched young,
   and there was no detectable increase in the failure of eggs to hatch for
   pairs neglecting their clutches more than 3 h per night. We suggest
   Red-necked Grebes preemptively leave their nests at night to avoid
   predation on their eggs or themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The richness and abundance of waterbird species were compared in active
   and abandoned saltpans in southeastern Spain. The effects of traditional
   methods of salt extraction in Mediterranean wetlands on the avian
   community were evaluated, as well as the effects of the abandonment of
   coastal salinas in Europe due to their present low profitability. Major
   changes in the waterbird community were found in disused saltpans, which
   were mainly due to environmental changes after salt production ceased.
   The diversity of bird species and the abundance of the diving species
   increased following abandonment, but the number of Greater Flamingo
   (Phoenicopterus ruber) and some shorebirds declined. Management measures
   required to improve the ornithological diversity in abandoned saltpans
   are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Capture techniques were developed to study the American Bittern
   (Botaurus lentiginosus). Mirror traps, mist nets, landing nets, night
   capture, funnel traps and net gun techniques were evaluated. Mirror
   traps and mist nets were used with a tape recording of the pumping call
   of the male bittern. Mist nets were also used to capture females at nest
   sites. Long-handled fish landing nets were used to capture molting birds
   and females on nests. Funnel traps were set at feeding sites. Mirror
   traps had a 50\% success rate and were the most efficient means of
   capturing males. Mist nets were versatile with success rates of 40\% on
   males and 50\% on females. Landing net success was 76\% on males and
   70\% on females but restricted to specific situations. Night capture was
   successful 33\% of the time and only on molting birds. Net guns had
   limited success (6\%) due to lack of skill and difficult to get close to
   birds. Funnel traps were not fully tested.}},

Abstract = {{The response of Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias), Great Egrets
   (Casmerodius albus), Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), and White Ibises
   (Eudocimus albus) to water level (index of depth) and vegetation in the
   northern Everglades of Florida was studied in two years, each with
   dissimilar water levels. A regression model was constructed for each
   species in an average year (1988) and a dry year (1989) to examine the
   relationship of bird abundance to water depth and area of eight
   vegetation classes. The analyses showed that bird abundance is related
   to both water level and the vegetation community, but water level
   generally had the greatest effect. Models showed that in the average
   year (1988), there was a water level threshold, above which bird
   abundance was predicted to decline. The level threshold varied among
   species and may have reflected species-specific foraging constraints.
   However, in the dry year (1989), the relationship between bird abundance
   and water level was positive and linear, indicating that few places had
   water deeper than the thresholds observed in the average year. Overall,
   the area of slough vegetation appeared to have the second greatest
   effect on bird abundance. Generally, all models had low coefficients of
   determination (R(2) range 0.06-0.42) suggesting that factors other than
   water level and vegetation were important, or birds were responding to
   variables in the model, but at different spatial scales than that which
   the data were collected. Models for Great Blue Herons and Great Egrets
   had higher coefficients of determination than models for Wood Storks and
   White Ibises. The more solitary feeding behavior of the herons and
   egrets resulted in a more even distribution across the marsh than for
   storks and ibiscs, which were usually found in flocks. Our study
   suggests that if restoration of the Everglades results in more natural
   hydrologic cycles, an increase in the amount of slough habitat, and a
   decrease in the proportion of cattails, foraging conditions for wading
   birds may improve.}},

Abstract = {{Nest defense theory interprets the behavior of animals faced with the
   threat of predation within an optimality framework in which risks to
   parents are balanced against risks to offspring. We conducted
   ``flights{''} of a model Peregrine (Falco peregrinus) towards nesting
   Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). Nesting parameters such as laying date,
   clutch-size (one to four eggs), and offspring age (fresh eggs to
   newly-hatched chicks) were known for 57 individual parents, while egg
   mass (16.5-24.6 g) was known for 50 parents. Age (three to 23 yr) and
   sex were known for 27 and 41 parents, respectively. We defined nest
   attentiveness as the number of outflights performed by each bird in the
   first 15 min after the Peregrine flight. Multivariate analysis showed
   that high attentiveness was associated with early laying and large eggs,
   but not with sex of the parents, distance from the predator, nor with
   clutch-size. Age of parents and age of offspring were less strongly
   correlated with nest attentiveness, but could not be excluded as
   explanatory variables. Among existing hypotheses, our results are most
   consistent with the hypothesis that nest attentiveness should increase
   with increasing value or quality of offspring. Given that previous
   studies have shown early laying and large eggs to be indicators of high
   parental quality in terns, we propose a new hypothesis that the
   intensity of nest attentiveness also increases with parental quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the hypothesis that parental quality, expressed in
   terms of nest location, determines differences in breeding parameters
   between colonies and colony areas. I compared hatching date, egg size,
   egg shape, clutch size, breeding Success and chick growth of Roseate
   Terns (Sterna dougallii) on the tropical Aride Island, Seychelles
   between: a) central pairs of an old colony, b) peripheral pairs of the
   same colony, c) pairs of old small sub-colonies and c) pairs of a
   recently formed colony. The breeding parameters at the small, old
   colonies were similar to those of the large, old colony and
   significantly different from those of the new colony, suggesting that
   parental quality is more closely related to sub-colony age than to
   sub-colony size. In 1998, a good breeding season, egg size was similar
   between all study areas, but clutch size in the new colony was
   significantly larger than that in the center of the old colony and the
   small sub-colonies. However, breeding success was significantly higher
   in the last two areas. In 1999, a poor breeding season, center-eggs were
   smaller than both edge-eggs and new-colony eggs. These patterns at the
   center of the old and the new colony are the opposite to those described
   for seabirds in temperate areas. The shape index of eggs in the new
   colony was lower than that of eggs in the old colony, suggesting that
   the new colony was formed mainly by young birds. Parameters of early
   growth and linear growth rate showed only minor differences between
   study colonies. The earliest breeding birds laid in the center of the
   old colony, so these results agree with a proposed hypothesis that
   tropical Roseate Terns trade egg and clutch size for earliness of
   laying. Therefore, the positive effect of larger egg size on the growth
   parameters of chicks from the new colony was probably annulled by the
   opposing effect of other factors such as low parental quality and
   declining foraging conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Because migration routes and stopover sites of the endangered Palearctic
   migratory Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) are poorly known,
   satellite tracking was used to map spring and autumn migration routes,
   stopover sites and ranging areas in Europe, Israel and Africa. Four
   immature and one adult individual were equipped with transmitters in
   Israel. Three of these pelicans did not migrate from Israel during the
   tracking period. One immature male pelican accomplished two spring
   migrations to Europe and an autumn migration back to Israel, where it
   over-wintered. Its northward routes passed through Lebanon, Syria,
   Turkey and Bulgaria and it arrived at the River Danube after three
   weeks. This individual's vast ranging areas in Europe during two
   consecutive summers included the Aegean Sea, Bulgaria, Greece and
   Romania, but excluded the Danube River breeding colony. One individual
   continued its migration to Africa. It reached the Sudd area in southern
   Sudan after two stops at Lake Nasser and in Jebel Aulia Dam on the White
   Nile. Its range in Africa included the Sudd, Lake Roseires on the Blue
   Nile, the lakes of the Ethiopian Great Valley and Lake Rudolf in Kenya.
   Although this information was obtained from a small number of
   individuals it is an essential addition to the body of knowledge
   required in order to establish a protection policy for this migratory
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is a predator on
   Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) in
   Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. This two-year study examined the
   biotic and abiotic factors that influenced the spatial patterns and
   temporal trends in pelican foraging on the 25-km segment of the
   Yellowstone River, immediately downstream from Yellowstone Lake. During
   May-August, 1994 and 1995, 81\% of the 1,581 pelicans counted during 62
   searches were between the lake outlet and 6 kin downstream. That river
   region may provide an efficient foraging site for pelicans because many
   Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout spawn there and the trout from the lake that
   spawn in river areas farther downstream pass through the region on both
   legs of their annual spawning migration. Most temporal variation
   (54-65\%) in pelican abundance within years was explained by multiple
   linear regression models that had river discharge and the counts of
   trout or their redds (i.e., spawning ``nests{''}) at one or the other of
   two major spawning areas as predictor variables. This study indicated
   that American White Pelican foraging on the Yellowstone River was
   associated, both spatially and temporally, with the spawning-related
   abundance of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in the Yellowstone River.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the distribution and behavior of 21 species of diving
   birds wintering in tidally active nearshore ocean off southern Vancouver
   Island, British Columbia, Canada. Using vessel surveys in one site and
   land-based observations at a second site, we found significant
   differences in the use of tidally affected water types among and within
   three foraging guilds (piscivores, plankton feeders and benthic
   invertebrate predators) and five families (Gaviidae, Podicipedidae,
   Phalacrocoracidae, Anatidae, Alcidae). The only abundant plankton
   feeder, Ancient Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), foraged more
   frequently than other birds in areas of deeper water (>10 m) with fast
   tidal flow and turbulence. Their abundance and diving activity were
   significantly higher at maximum tide flow than at slack tides.
   Piscivores used both slack water and moderate currents in a wide range
   of depths but, apart from alcids and Pelagic Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   pelagicus), avoided areas of high current and turbulence. Pigeon
   Guillemots (Cepphus columba) had higher abundance at tide phases with
   maximum current, and within a channel with strong tidal flow they showed
   repetitive upstream flights interspersed with downstream diving bouts.
   Fish-eating mergansers and most diving ducks taking benthic
   invertebrates foraged in relatively shallow (<10 m) and slack water, and
   avoided turbulence. Six species representing all three guilds showed
   changes in the use of depth categories as tides changed between slack
   and maximum current, and four species changed their behavior in
   different depth categories. Although there was considerable overlap in
   foraging niches, the differences in distribution and behavior of guilds,
   families, and species of diving birds indicate a degree of resource
   partitioning within tidally-driven water categories during winter.}},

Abstract = {{An aerial survey of post-breeding molting Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus) was carried out in late July 1999 along the southern half
   of the West Greenland coast. About 3,500 birds were located, which at
   this time of the year almost exclusively are males. Based on this
   observation a total of 5,000-10,000 Harlequin Duck males were estimated
   to molt in West Greenland. About 98\% of the surveyed birds were found
   in the southern half of the study area. This distribution pattern may be
   linked to the presence of Atlantic Canadian males, which probably
   account for an appreciable proportion of the molting males in Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, very little was known about the basic ecology of the
   Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) in eastern North America,
   including molting locations. A combination of aerial, ground and boat
   surveys were initiated in 1989 (Quebec) and 1994 (Newfoundland and
   Labrador), and continued through 1999, to locate their molting areas.
   Molting Harlequin Ducks were found in Labrador, Newfoundland and the
   Gaspe Peninsula and Anticosti Island, Quebec. Coastal areas of southern
   Labrador, Grey Islands, northern Newfoundland, and Bonaventure and
   Anticosti Islands, southern Quebec, were the most important sites. The
   tip of northern Labrador and possibly sites along the Quebec North Shore
   and Greenland are the most likely sites where the rest of the eastern
   population molts. Molting chronology for the ducks in Quebec is similar
   to those on the east and west coast of North America. Now that these
   sites are known, monitoring and, if necessary, protection of these sites
   can be considered.}},

Abstract = {{In waterfowl, the male costs and female benefits hypothesis considers
   that the timing of pairing will depend on the balance between the costs
   and benefits for each sex. Females may benefit by increasing their
   access to food and social status, and by decreasing harassment from
   conspecifics, while maintaining a pair bond for a long period should be
   costly to males. To investigate costs and benefits of early pairing in
   the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), we compared time budgets
   and frequency of interactions (agonistic, courtship, and mate guarding
   behavior) from paired and impaired males and females. A total of 400
   thirty-minute focal-animal sampling sessions were used for the analysis.
   Overall, feeding time did not differ between paired and impaired birds
   of both sexes. However, regardless of their reproductive status, females
   spent about 15\% more time feeding than males throughout the winter.
   While diving, paired males spent 4\% less time underwater than impaired
   males, but no difference was found between paired and impaired females.
   Males spent more time on the surface between dives than females, yet the
   differences between paired and impaired birds were not significant.
   Paired males were engaged in more interactions (mainly mate guarding)
   than impaired males. Interactions received by paired and unpaired
   females did not differ overall, however, from late October to early May,
   interactions with paired females decreased, while interactions directed
   to impaired females increased. Thus the pair bond, though being
   apparently costly to males, did not obviously benefit females by
   increasing feeding time. Early pairing in the Harlequin Duck may result
   from other factors, such as the advantages that pair reunion may confer.}},

Abstract = {{Nearshore counts of birds on the water and time-lapse photography were
   used to monitor seasonal activity patterns and interannual variation in
   numbers of Horned Puffins (Fratercula corniculata) and Parakeet Auklets
   (Aethia psittacula) at the Semidi Islands, Alaska. The best period for
   over-water counts was mid egg-laying through hatching in auklets and
   late prelaying through early hatching in puffins. Daily counts (07.00
   h-09.30 h) varied widely, with peak numbers and days with few or no
   birds present occurring throughout the census period. Variation among
   annual means in four years amounted to 26\% and 72\% of total count
   variation in puffins and auklets, respectively. Time-lapse photography
   of nesting habitat in early incubation revealed a morning (08.00 h-12.00
   h) peak in the number of puffins loitering on study plots. Birds
   recorded in time-lapse images never comprised more than a third of the
   estimated breeding population on a plot. Components of variance in the
   time-lapse study were 29\% within hours, 9\% among hours (08.00 h-12.00
   h), and 62\% among days (8-29 June). Variability of over-water and
   land-based counts is reduced by standardizing the time of day when
   counts are made, but weather conditions had little influence on either
   type of count. High interannual variation of population indices implies
   low power to detect numerical trends in crevice-nesting auklets and
   puffins.}},

Abstract = {{Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), Andean Flamingo
   (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James' Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi)
   occur in the high Andes water bodies of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and
   Peru. The objectives of this study were to analyze seasonal variations
   in flamingo abundance and movements related to climatic conditions, and
   to identify the physical characteristics of water bodies determining the
   seasonal distribution and abundance. Flamingo numbers reached a peak in
   summer and diminished in winter. Within the high Andes region, the
   Andean Flamingo was mainly found in the Dry and Dry-cold climatic
   sub-regions during summer. This species moved into the Dry sub-region in
   winter. In summerjames' Flamingo primarily occurred in water bodies of
   the Dry-cold sub-region. During winter, some individuals remained in the
   Dry-cold sub-region, and others moved to the Wet, Dry and Desert
   sub-regions. In summer, Chilean Flamingo occurred principally in the Dry
   sub-region. In winter, few remained in the Dry sub-region, and most
   birds moved to the Wet sub-region. These seasonal changes in flamingo
   numbers within the high Andes show that in winter, these birds move from
   sub-regions with extreme climatic conditions (Desert and Dry-cold
   sub-regions) to those with more suitable conditions (Wet and Dry
   sub-regions). The seasonal fluctuation in abundance might be explained
   by intra- and inter-regional movements in response to adverse climatic
   conditions. The relationships between water body physical
   characteristics and flamingo species show that the Chilean Flamingo
   mainly used lakes, both in summer and winter. James' Flamingo usually
   used saline playa-lakes at high altitudes in summer and winter. Andean
   Flamingo selected salt-flats during summer and lakes in winter. It is
   suggested that Chilean and James' Flamingos are habitat-specialists and
   the Andean Flamingo is a habitat-generalist.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the Sanderling (Calidris alba) was studied using 105
   droppings, 34 pellets and direct observations of feeding behavior. This
   study was carried out during the non-reproductive seasons of 1996 to
   2000 in Monte Hermoso, SW of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A total of eleven
   prey items were identified, with beetles (Coleoptera), Mussels
   (Brachydontes rodriguezi), clams (Corbula sp.), amphipods (Carophium
   sp.) and Diptera being the most frequent. The consumption of
   polychaetes, algae, ants and small fish was also recorded. Sanderlings
   followed foraging American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) and
   cleaned out the valves of mussels and clams (Mesodesma mactroides) left
   by them. Mussels and beetles were the most constant and dominant prey
   during the study period. The association of Sanderlings with sandy
   coasts with rocky patches or restingas is probably due to the rich and
   diverse invertebrate communities present in this kind of environment,
   which allow birds to change feeding techniques between different
   substrates.}},

Abstract = {{During 20 years, numbers of Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser
   albifrons) wintering in Japan have increased 5.6 times (ca. 46,000 in
   1999), with over 80\% of the geese concentrated around Lake
   Izunuma-Uchinuma, in northern Japan. Detailed information on the
   wintering ecology of the geese had not been investigated in Japan and
   the daily activity pattern and habitat use of the geese were studied
   around the lake in three winters (October-February), 1996/97, 1997/98
   and 1998/99. The daily activity pattern, i.e., flight timing and
   behavior relating to environmental factors (light intensity, snowfall,
   temperature and wind speed), was similar to that for several other geese
   species in temperate areas. The geese wintering in Japan depended
   exclusively on rice in fields; they foraged in stubble fields, where the
   density of rice grains was much higher than that in plowed fields.
   However, the area of stubble fields around the lake has decreased from
   1980 to 2000, while combine harvesters replaced machinery, which only
   cut the rice plants (reapers). The amount of rice grains left in the
   fields by the combine harvesters was 8.7 times than the reapers. The
   replaced cropping machinery increased the abundance of food and might
   facilitate an increase in geese numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Colony attendance by the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) was
   examined to investigate daily and seasonal patterns of variation, and to
   determine the biological or environmental factors, if any, which serve
   as useful predictors of such variation. Observations were made during
   the pre-laying and incubation stages of the breeding season on a study
   plot at a colony on Gull Island, Witless Bay Seabird Ecological Reserve,
   Newfoundland, Canada. The number of birds on the surface of the colony
   increased through the day, but the peak number differed between
   consecutive days. Colony attendance showed a possible cyclical trend
   across days with a periodicity ranging from two to six days. Residency
   time of individual birds was associated with the extent of colony
   attendance, suggesting a positive feedback loop between individual
   short-term turnover and numbers present on the breeding slope. Neither
   weather nor presence of large gulls was related to puffin attendance.
   The correlation between residency time and colony attendance suggests
   that puffins may be more confident on land when surrounded by other
   conspecifics. With the high variability and no obvious factors that
   influence attendance, the use of colony surface counts of individuals to
   infer population parameters is likely limited in this species.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes qualitatively and quantitatively the
   kleptoparasitic behavior of the Brown-hooded Gull (Larus maculipennis)
   and Grey-hooded Gull (Laras cirrocephalus) on the American Oystercatcher
   (Haematopus palliatus), and considers the influence of environmental
   variables on the occurrence and Success of the kleptoparasitism. Focal
   and scan samplings were performed, recording a total of 358
   kleptoparasitic attempts. The overall occurrence rate was 1.2 +/- 1.3
   attempts per 5 min., of which 42\% of attempts were successful. All
   kleptoparasitic attempts were performed when oystercatchers were feeding
   on Stout Razor Clams (Tagellus plebeius). Gulls stole food from
   Oystercatchers by two kleptoparasitic tactics; running (used in 40\% of
   cases) and flying (used in 60\% of cases). A significant difference in
   the rate of success of kleptoparasitism and an increase in the use of
   flying kleptoparasitism were observed under windy conditions. Gulls
   showed limited ability to open clams by themselves, and never swallowed
   whole clams. Kleptoparasitic attacks Occurred within three seconds of
   the clam being ingested by the host, indicating the accurate
   kleptoparasitic skills of hooded gulls. Possible factors that affected
   the decisions taken by gulls about when and how to start the robbing
   behavior are discussed. Features of the kleptoparasitic behavior
   performed by hooded gulls on oystercatchers provide some relevant
   questions regarding the ``generalist{''} or ``specialist{''} character
   of these parasites.}},

Abstract = {{The delta(18)C, delta(15)N, and delta(31)S stable isotopic values of
   feathers from pre-fledged Laughing Gulls (Larus articilla) in coastal
   Virginia and Jamaica Bay, New York were used to examine dietary
   variation during the nestling period. The tip portions of the feathers
   were used to indicate diet during the initiation of primary feather
   growth, whereas the base portions indicated diet during the period
   immediately prior to fledging. The results indicate that diets of the
   nestlings in Virginia moved to a higher trophic level during the period
   prior to fledging, however the New York nestlings did not appear to
   undergo any appreciable dietary change during this period. Overall,
   nestlings from both colonies consumed proportionately more foods of
   marine origin than freshwater or terrestrial. Therefore, the results do
   not support those of earlier studies that suggested that partially
   developed salt glands in young gulls might restrict the diet to more
   terrestrial or freshwater prey in the early stages of nestling growth.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the diet of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in several
   islands of the Azores during 1994, based on the analysis of 777 food
   pellets. The diet of Common Terns was based on a few species of small
   pelagic fish. Trumpet Fish (Macroramphosus spp.) dominated the. diet in
   terms of both frequency of occurrence (84\%) and numerical frequency
   (69\%). This species, together with Boarfish (Capros aper), Blue Jack
   Mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) and lantern fish (Families Myctophidae,
   Sternoptychidae, Diretmidae), accounted for more than 96\% of the prey
   taken by Common Terns on all the islands. Insects occurred in 10\% of
   all pellets analyzed and were present in almost 15\% of the pellets from
   Corvo. Lantern fish represented an important fraction of the diet of
   Common Terns in the Azores and included several species previously
   undescribed as prey of seabirds in the region. Comparisons with dietary
   data obtained in subsequent years showed little inter-annual variability
   in the frequency of abundance of the main prey species, except for the
   lantern fish, which exhibited a higher frequency Of Occurrence in 1995.}},

Abstract = {{Social stimulation in concert with environmental factors may influence
   the degree of reproductive synchrony among colonial breeders.
   Synchronous breeding has been shown to enhance reproductive Success by
   decreasing predation. Although Common Murres (Uria aalge) typically have
   a cyclic pre-lay attendance pattern, during one of four consecutive
   breeding seasons we observed one acyclic pre-lay period (1999). The
   present study, Investigated how differences in pre-lay attendance
   patterns may influence breeding synchrony and reproductive success in a
   Common Murre sub-colony on Great Island, Newfoundland. Compared to the
   cyclic pre-lay period (2000). the acyclic pre-lay period showed: i) less
   synchronous egg-laying, ii) pairs spent less time together at their site
   due to the overall lower attendance by both sexes, but particularly by
   females, and iii) higher predation during early and first half of peak
   egg-laying, although overall reproductive success did not differ between
   years due to high re-laying rates. These results suggest that cyclic
   attendance (hiring the pre-lay period of Common Murres may influence
   breeding synchrony within a sub-colony, which may reduce predation
   during early incubation and late chick rearing.}},

Abstract = {{We studied tire way, timing and diurnal rhythm of young Atlantic Puffins
   (Fratercula aretica) leaving colonies in NW Norway and Faeroes. The
   colonies differed in nesting habitat and predatory pressure. Both adult
   and young Puffins from Bleiksoy were significantly larger and heavier
   than those front Nolsoy. Young birds, left the Bleiksoy colony about ten
   days later in the season, but considerably earlier during the night
   (22.00-04.00 h; peak: 00.00-01.00 h) than those on Nolsoy (24.00-0600 h;
   peak: 02.00-03.00 h). The fledging period was more synchronized on
   Bleiksoy, both within the season and on particular nights. Body mass and
   size of young puffins leaving the colony tended to decrease through the
   fledging period. Well-developed voting birds from sloping parts of the
   Bleik colony flew down to the sea, while those from the lower-lying,
   flatter parts of the colony and those in poor condition walked to the
   sea. Fledglings which left on the wing reached the sea about one hour
   earlier and could fly beyond the inshore waters before daybreak, thus
   avoiding the risk Of gull predation. They were more numerous during the
   first six days of the 10-day fledging period and were larger than those,
   which left on foot. The latter lost much time and energy overcoming
   dense vegetation, boulders and the tidal zone on their way to the open
   sea. As a result, the, were still near the shore at dawn, in the zone
   intensively penetrated by predators. We suggest that predatory pressure
   of the big gulls, which are numerous on Bleiksoy but almost absent from
   Nolsoy, could have a significant impact on timing of fledging of their
   prey.}},

   habitat for shorebirds}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{173-183}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to result in an acceleration in Current rates
   of sea level rise, inundating many low-lying coastal arid intertidal
   areas. This could have important implications for organisms that depend
   on these sites, including shorebirds that rely on them for feeding
   habitat during their migrations and in winter. We modeled the potential
   changes in the extent of intertidal foraging habitat for shorebirds at
   five sites in the United States that currently-support internationally
   important numbers of migrating and wintering birds. Even assuming a
   conservative global warming scenario of 2degreesC within the next
   century (the most recent projections range between 1.4degreesC and
   5.8degreesC), we project major intertidal habitat loss at four of the
   sites (Willapa Bay, Humboldt Bay, San Francisco Bay, arid Delaware Bay).
   Projected losses range between 20\% and 70\% of current intertidal
   habitat. Such losses might jeopardize the ability of these sites to
   continue to support their current shorebird numbers. The most Severe
   losses are likely to occur at sitcom where the coastline is unable to
   move inland because of steep topography or seawalls. The effects of sea
   level rise may be exacerbated by additional anthropogenic factors. In
   southern San Francisco Bay, for example, sea level rise may interact
   with land subsidence due to aquifer depletion, and the constraints
   imposed by existing seawalls on the landward migration of habitat,
   resulting in the greatest habitat loss. At the fifth site (Bolivar
   Flats) we project smaller losses as the intertidal habitat: are
   unconstrained by sea walls and will be able to migrate inland in
   response to rising sea level. Installation of additional coastal
   protection barriers at this site and others is likely to exacerbate the
   rate and extent of intertidal habitat loss.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{High levels of egg predation by numerous vertebrates has been implicated
   as a limiting factor in many avian populations. In response,
   ornithologists often attempt to control potential egg predators through
   lethal methods or large scale fencing of breeding habitat. More
   recently, individual nest exclosures have been employed to deter egg
   predators. During 1999 and 2000, we experimentally tested nest exclosure
   effectiveness at enhancing Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) nest success
   in the Great Basin, USA. We demonstrated that nests with exclosures had
   significantly lower daily mortality rates compared to nests without
   exclosures. Although nest exclosures increased Killdeer nest success in
   this study, it is necessary to identify predators impacting nest success
   prior to the exclosure design. Nest exclosures are unlikely to be
   equally successful among sites, and variation in exclosure design may be
   required across both the range of a species and/or breeding seasons at a
   single site. The exclosure design we used did not deter small mammals
   and birds, or reptiles; and we observed small mustelids killing
   incubating birds. However, these exclosures were effective at increasing
   hatching success by deterring larger predators, (ravens, gulls, canids).
   Any benefit derived from the nest exclosure used may potentially be
   offset by increased predation oil incubating adults. Nest exclosures are
   not a means of preserving biological diversity over geologic time, but
   rather a potential temporary site-specific tool that increases nest
   success while long-term conservation plans are developed.}},

   Elmenteita, Nakuru (counted since 1991) and Bogoria are close to each
   other in the southern Rift Valley and hold the bulk of both resident and
   migrant waterbirds counted each year. Levels of the four lakes fluctuate
   substantially and all but Naivasha are saline. By contrast, Dandora
   Ponds near Nairobi is a site with stable water levels. We compared
   trends in numbers of birds, categorized by family and by migratory
   status, with an earlier analysis in 1996 and between tire fluctuating
   Rift Valley lakes and Dandora Ponds. Flamingo numbers remained highly
   variable at all sites, showing no long-term trends. In 1996, significant
   declines were found in many piscivorous waterbird groups, including
   grebes, pelicans, cormorants, storks, terns and gulls, mainly associated
   with falling lake levels at Lake Nakuru; by 2000, numbers had recovered.
   Consistent declines in rallids, birds of prey and kingfishers were
   evident in 1996, mainly due to falling numbers at Lake Naivasha. By
   2000, kingfisher numbers had fully, and raptor numbers had partially,
   recovered. Rallids, mainly Red-knobbed Coot (Fulica cristata), continued
   to decline sharply through 1998, but recovered slightly to 1996 levels
   by 2000. After notably high numbers in 19961999, Palaearctic ducks
   declined dramatically in 2000 to a ten-year low. With the exception of
   rallids, none of the groups that had declined from 1991-1996 showed any
   trend in numbers over the extended time period. At Dandora, numbers of
   most waterbird groups fluctuated substantially despite constant
   conditions. The fluctuations showed little synchrony with between
   species or with those at the southern Rift Valley lakes, suggesting
   waterbirds were responding to the availability of suitable wetlands over
   a large area. The declines from 1991-1996 in the southern Rift Valley
   were temporary; recoveries in waterbird numbers were not attributable to
   improved environmental management (human pressures on these wetlands
   intensified front 1997-2000), but to higher lake levels in 1997/98. The
   ten-year data set covers it full cycle of low and high lake levels,
   which the six-year dataset did not, and may now form an adequate
   baseline for monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first detailed information on breeding marine birds from
   the southern Lagoon of New Caledonia, southwest Pacific. The area under
   consideration, 5,000 km(2), hosts 74 islets varying in size from ca.
   0.05 to 30 ha. We found 13 breeding seabird species, of the 23 known to
   breed in the New Caledonian region. The most significant seabird numbers
   included large colonies of Black Noddy (Anous minutus, 50,000-100,000
   pairs) and especially Wed.-e-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus);
   the latter species totaling half a million pairs and probably the
   largest colony in the world. About 5,000 pairs of Roseate Tern (Sterna
   dougalli) have been found. Several species of conservation concern are
   also breeding in appreciable numbers, e.g., Fain. Tern (Sterna nereis)
   and Tahiti Petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata); both New Caledonian endemic
   subspecies. However. sonic species are now very rare (e.g., Red-footed
   Booby Sula sula), and others have appreciably declined over the last
   eight years (Fain. Tern, Black-naped Tern Sterna sumatrana and Crested
   Tern S. bergii). The recent increase in the frequency of visits to
   islets, by people from Noumea (ca. 100,000 inhabitants), resulting from
   the increase in the number of leisure boats, may be the principal factor
   responsible for the current trends and threats. Human disturbance seems
   to be a major threat that may lead to desertion of seabirds on islets,
   or reduced breeding success.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting ecology of the Greater Adjutant Stork (Leptoptilos dubius),
   the rarest stork in the world, was studied in the Brahmaputra Valley,
   Assam, India during 1994-97. We made a study of nine colonies in the
   valley during the 1994-95 nesting season, followed by a more intensive
   studs in two subsequent nesting seasons (1995-96 and 1996-97) of two
   colonies at Nagaon, in central Assam. We measured the dimensions of both
   nest and non-nest trees, nearest distance between nest trees, and
   nearest house, nearest forest, nearest road, nearest water source and
   nearest foraging ground from each colony. All of the colonies were near
   human settlements. The Structure of nest trees differed significantly
   from non-nest trees in both the overall and the intensive studies.
   Number of nests was highly correlated with tree height, diameter at
   breast height (DBH) and canopy area. About 90\% of nests were built on
   the top of the canopy. Storks preferred to nest in compact colonies on
   large, widely branched Lives with thin foliage cover and nearby food
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the distribution and estimate the density of the Flightless
   Steamer Duck (Tachyeres pteneres) and the Kelp Goose (Chloephaga
   hybrida) along the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego, during the summer
   season (February and March) 1997. Using a 10-min transects method front
   a vessel; we estimated density and evaluated its relation with different
   characteristics of habitats. The Study area was divided a priori into
   six zones. Due to the scarcity of information about these species, we
   reviewed previous literature to evaluate seasonal movements and made
   comparisons with other regions of Tierra del Fuego. Differences in
   habitat distribution compared with the previous studies in the same area
   are reported. In tire Beagle Channel, the Flightless Steamer Duck was
   more abundant than the Kelp Goose. The observed distribution seems to be
   a result of a preference for the inner waters of the Beagle Channel, at
   the western sector of the study area. In spite of the difference in the
   distribution of the two water fowl, both preferred similar habitats. The
   preferred habitat was protected coasts such as small bays, inlets, or
   sectors of the islands sheltered front tire prevailing winds and
   currents. The geese moved during autumn and winter from the Beagle
   Channel and Staten Island to the Atlantic coast. In terms of difference
   in density between areas, the Kelp Geese were twenty times more frequent
   in Staten Island than around the Beagle Channel, while Flightless
   Steamer Duck were twice as dense in Staten Island than the Beagle
   Channel.}},

Abstract = {{In keeping with many species of waterbirds, there is little difference
   in the body size or external appearance of adult male and female
   Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus). Previous work has indicated that some
   morphological characteristics and behavioral patterns differ on average
   between sexes but there has yet to be a quantitative evaluation of the
   accuracy or applicability of these different criteria in determining
   sex. The aim of this Study was to use DNA-based techniques to determine
   the sexes of adults and to use this information to evaluate a range of
   behavioral and morphological criteria for sex determination. Nape-biting
   behavior was frequently Observed, was performed almost exclusively
   (>99\% of observations) by males and was completely accurate in
   assigning sexes on the basis of multiple observations at each nest: this
   confirms previous results which indicated that nape-biting is highly
   sex-specific. Collection of nest material was also performed primarily
   by males, but this seldom occurred and so despite over 500 h of
   observations at each nest, fewer than 30\% of pairs were sexed correctly
   using this criterion. Only two-thirds of birds were sexed correctly from
   head plumage color and fewer than 30\% from foot web-line color.
   Behavioral observations were as accurate as DNA-based sexing and more
   effective dian morphology for sexing adult birds at all stages of chick
   rearing.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting in association with species that aggressively attack predators
   may reduce nest predation in some birds. For example, nesting ducks
   sometimes benefit from aggressive defence by nesting Canada Geese
   (Branta canadensis). Although Common Elders (Somateria mollissima)
   commonly nest with gulls (Larus spp.), the costs and benefits for elders
   of this association remain uncertain. Over two years, 32 instances of
   kleptoparasitism of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) by Canada Geese
   were recorded in arctic Canada. The Canada Geese nested amongst Common
   Elders and interrupted Herring Gulls while taking eider eggs. The geese
   displaced Herring Gulls from approximately ten percent of all cider eggs
   taken front nests, and ate egg contents themselves. Kleptoparasitism may
   provide Canada Geese with an important exogenous food resource, but the
   small overall number of eggs stolen from gulls (less than five percent
   of all cider eggs laid) limits the potential consequences of additive
   compensatory predation pressure by gulls within the eider colony.}},

   mainly occurred in October, November, and April, and they stayed longer
   at the lake during their autumn migration than during the spring
   migration. The seasonal distribution pattern of total numbers of all
   waterbirds was bimodal. One peak occurred between late December and
   early January, and the other in middle March. The seasonal distribution
   patterns of 15 common species have been classified a. bimodal, unimodal,
   or irregular. The numbers of five common species were variable in middle
   winter, and their numerical Change in contiguous weeks were more than
   30\%, suggesting that local movements might be frequent.}},

Abstract = {{Early attempts to identify sex in sexually monomorphic birds were based

   DNA sequences were identified, their PCR amplification has become
   commonly used molecular sexing method. We report here a DNA technique
   that amplifies an intrinsic CHD region without a DNA extraction. This
   test was applied to twelve species belonging to three waterbird orders,
   Ciconiiformes, Pelecaniformes and Phoenicopteriformes. All birds were
   sexed Successfully with high reproducibility. There was complete
   agreement between our results and sex diagnosis by parallel Methods.
   Because the proposed method eliminates the DNA extraction step, this
   protocol is more efficient and simple. It demands only minute amounts of
   DNA and reduces both time and the quantities of reagents Consumed.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermal conductance (C-m),
   and lower critical temperature (T-lc) of Leach's Storm-petrel
   (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) using open-flow respirometry. Measurements were
   taken from six adult collected at their nests at Great Island, Witless
   Bay Ecological Reserve, Ne Newfoundland, Canada. In order to establish
   T, and C,,,, we determined rates of oxygen consumption after exposing
   birds to different ambient temperatures (10degreesC, 20degreesC,
   26degreesC, and 30degreesC). Storm-petrels had a minimal C-m of 0.122
   +/- 0.019 ml O-2/g.degreesC.h and T-lc was 24degreesC. The basal rate of
   oxygen consumption was 1.85 +/- 0.24 ml O-2/.hg. Incubating Leach's
   Storm-petrels had a basal rate of metabolism lower than previously
   reported for this species. Possible explanations for this discrepancy
   include the use of different techniques to measure metabolic rates, and
   the physiological state of the birds being measured. In this respect,
   our results Coupled with those from Previous Studies, suggest decreased
   metabolic rates in incubating Procellariformes compared to those of
   non-reproducing birds measured at the same temperature. This decline in
   metabolism is possibly related to metabolic depression due to fasting.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Incubatory Reserves Constancy{''} hypothesis asserts that
   incubation could be a departure from breeding stress that allows for the
   maintenance or recovery, of body reserves after laying effort (females)
   or territory, defense (males) in those species with bi-parental
   incubation such as gulls. The plasma composition and bodymass of
   incubating Yellow-leggcd Gulls (Larus cachinnans) were analyzed and
   related to the number of days after egg-laying. Female gulls showed an
   increase in uric acid and cholesterol levels, whereas males showed only
   an increase in uric acid values throughout this period. Moreover,
   females increased while males maintained their body masses. These
   results could i eflect a recovery process after the laying effort
   supporting the Incubatory Reserves Constancy hypothesis in females. Uric
   acid and Urea levels are positively correlated to body condition in
   Yellow-legged Gulls, which could be the result of a Change in diet
   composition. This disagrees with recent findings on body Composition in
   incubating gulls and could be related to variations in food availability
   among populations or years, and could reflect flexibility in the
   investment devoted by each sex.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the feeding patterns of Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus) and
   Snowy Egrets (Egretta thulea) in flowing and still aquatic habitats of
   coastal (New York City) and interior (Wichita, Kansas) locations. These
   included strike rate, prey capture rate, strike success, ``idle time{''}
   and diet. We tested the hypothesis that widtAy-distributed species of
   wading birds that face different ecological conditions across their
   geographic range modify their feeding behavior to match local
   conditions. If this hypothesis is correct, then the feeding patterns of
   egrets at the coastal site will differ front those in the interior.
   Great Egrets in coastal habitats had higher capture rates and strike
   rates than interior birds, but strike success was similar in both areas.
   The diets of coastal and interior Great Egrets were broadly similar.
   Great Egrets also spent less ``idle time{''} while foraging at coastal
   sites than at interior sites. Snowy Egrets had higher capture rates at
   interior sites, but strike rates did not differ between study areas.
   Snowy regrets also had higher strike success at interior sites, but also
   more ``idle time{''}. Their diets also were similar in both areas.

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of Red-legged Cormorants (Phalacarorax
   gaimardi) were assessed by visiting 42 localities on the mainland and
   Surveying Most of the islands along Peru's 2.500 km coastline between
   October 1999 and December 2000. Cormorants were distributed in small
   discrete groups (Mode = 5 birds, range 1-69) from Isla Foca
   (5degrees12'S) to Morro Santa (18degrees0'S). The southern (56\%, of the
   total numbers) and central (34\%) coast field a larger proportion of
   cormorants than did the northern region (10\%). Birds were mainly
   located in unptotected areas, either on islands (6\%) or on the mainland
   (51 \%). The remainder was found in protected areas, either guano bird
   islands (27\%). guano bird headlands (3\%) or within the Paracas Reserve
   (13\%,). We Counted 658 bird, (95\% adults, 5\% juveniles), but based on
   bird density. availability of suitable habitats and cliff lengths we
   predictcd a total of 1,803 282 birds in Peru. Red-legged Cormorants
   built their nests on narrow ledges on vertical rocky walls falling sheer
   to the sea, located on average, 17.8 m (range = 3-50, N = 56) above the
   sea level on open Cliffs. high-up in sea cave entrances m on small
   islets. They have undergone a spectacular decline over, the last 30
   years. Between 1968 and 1999-2000. the numbers at ten localities in the
   northern and central coast decreased from 3,229 to 69 birds, It is
   likely that low numbers recorded in this study reflect the devastating
   effects of the strong El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of 1997-98. as
   numbers prior and after this event at eight southern localities
   decreased by 73 \%. Because of the inaccessibility of their nesting and
   roosting sites and the lack of natural predators, Red-legged Cormorants
   are apparently not in danger at Such sites. However, entanglement in
   fishing nets. competition for food in inshore waters. pollution, human
   disturbance and harvesting of kelp banks are potential threats at sea
   and Could affect the population recovery. Received 24 September 2001,

Abstract = {{Killdeer (Charadirus vociferus) is a common and widespread North
   American species for which there are few studies of residency patterns
   and movements. We quantified fidelity and movement patterns of 24
   radio-tagged Killdeer in the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the
   winter of 1999-2000. Results from telemetry surveys and census efforts
   repealed that the group monitored was composed of winter residents
   (63\%), winter transient, (26\%), and year-round residents (11\%).
   Movements were localized with birds detected at an average distance of
   5.15 +/- 0.91 (SE) km front the site of capture. Mean home range size
   (95\% kernel) was 7.73 +/- 3.19 km(2). However. results also indicated
   periodic exploratory movements. with some birds detected Lip to 30 kin
   from marking Sites. Overall, individuals exhibited a low degree of
   fidelity to specific sites and were detected at an average of 11.9 +/-
   1.1 sites. No differences were found in monthly movement patterns. In
   almost all cases, year-round residents were more sedentary than winter
   residents and winter transients. Results indicate a complex regional
   population structure and highlight the need to consider both migrant and
   resident birds, as well as seasonal differences in habitat needs and
   space use requirements, in future conservation planning efforts.

   of the ten breeding species remained relatively stable during the
   period, while those fit one species, the White-tailed Tropicbird
   (Phaethon lepturus) underwent a 60\% decline. Roseate Tern (Sterna

   followed by a significant increase between 1994 and 2000. Current Count
   data for Audubon's Shearwater (Puffinus Therminieri) and the
   Wedge-tailed Shearwater (P.Pacificus) are insufficient to establish
   trends. The maximum annual count of roosting non-breeding frigatebirds
   (Fregata spp.) increased steadily throughout the period. The island has
   internationally important numbers of breeding seabirds (330,000-720,000
   pairs per annum), including the largest known colony of Audubon's

Abstract = {{Rubbish dumps provide an extra and constant food source for manybirds.
   The White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) is one of the species that have taken
   advantage of these new foraging areas both during breeding season and
   during the winter. This study analyzes data collected in the Spanish
   province, of Cordoba throughout the years between 1992 and 1998 on the
   biology and breeding success of the White Stork and the influence of
   rubbish dumps, Breeding success varied significantly between years and
   areas in two of the study years. A banding program from 1990 to 1998
   resulted in 145 storks being marked as nestlings. Of these, 49 were
   resighted at least once by May 2001 (34\% resighting rate) and 16 of
   these birds were resighted as breeders at a mean age of 2.87 years. 75\%
   of them were breeding close to rubbish dumps. Fifteen birds were
   resighted during wintering time, of which twelve were at rubbish dumps.

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacvocorax auritis) predation on Channel
   Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) at commercial farms has been estimated to
   cost the Mississippi aquaculture industry approximately \$5 million
   annually to replace consumed fingerlings. In 1997. catfish producers
   assumed responsibility for the dispersal of corininants in flight roosts
   in Life eastern if (interior) delta region of Mississippi, where catfish
   tariffs are concentrated. We documented movements of 50 cormorants
   marked with radio transmitters in the delta region from january through
   March 1997. We obtained 161 post-capture day locations and 176
   post-capture flight roost locations. Cormorants that were harassed at
   their night roost flew farther to their next day's location than birds
   that were not harassed thee previous flight. Of the cormorants for which
   we had more than one flight roost location, only, 11\% of cormorants
   that were harassed returned to the same roost within 48 hours. compared
   with an 81\% return of cormorants to a previonsly un-harassed night
   roost. Moreover, cormorants in the eastern portion of the delta (where
   all harassment was conducted) changed night roosts more frequently than
   cormorants in the western (non-harassed) delta. Since cormorants ill our
   study foraged relatively close to their flight roosts and only 11\% of
   the birds that we observed roosting in the western delta traveled to the
   eastern delta to forage the following clav. coordinated and intensive
   dispersal of cormorants from the interior delta may, temporarily, limit
   cormorant impacts to Mississippi aquaculture. Received 10 July 2001,

Abstract = {{Nesting adult Sevchelles Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata) were banded in
   five colonies, Searches for banded birds were made annually during the
   incubation phase of the breeding cycle, within the colonies on Bird
   Island (largely protected from human intrusion) and Desnoeufs Island
   (from half of which eggs are harvested annually), differences in the
   tendency to return to nest sites used in earlier years were attributed
   to the effects of human disturbance, especially egg collecting. On Bird
   Island, the only colony that was searched intensively for banded birds
   each year between 1994 and 2001, eighteen birds were found that had
   formerly nested in other colonies. These inter-colony movements of
   breeding adults were also attributed to human disturbance in soul-cc
   colonies, but Changes in food distribution may have stimulated birds to
   move from a colony that was protected from human interference. The
   finding that breeding adult Sooty Terns sometimes switch colonies
   suggests that these Sevchelles colonies should be regarded as units
   within a metapopulation, with genetic exchange between units. This must
   be taken into account when estimating the allowable harvest of eggs. for

Abstract = {{The distribution of the Whiskered Tern (Chlidonias hybridus) is
   scattered, numbers fluctuate and they are threatened in many regions.
   Its breeding ecology has only occasionally been studied so far. It is
   relatively common in some North African wetlands. This study was carried
   out on Lake Tonga, northern Algeria, south of El-Kala (36degrees51'N:
   08degrees20'E) in 1996 and 1997, with 169 and 215 initiated Clutches
   studied. respectively. Basic characteristics of the Whiskered Tern
   Weeding ecology studied were: laying date, clutch size, hatchling
   number, nest size and shape and egg size. Hatching success differed
   significantly between 1996 and 1997, probably due to weather. Laying
   date did not influence breeding parameters. Clutch size and hatching
   success were correlated with size and shape of nests. Hatchability was
   also correlated with egg length (negatively) and mass (positively).
   Relationships between breeding characteristic in relation to weather are
   discussed. Received 12 October 2001. accepted 14November 2001.}},

Abstract = {{Post-hatch brood amalgamation is common in many waterfowl species and
   especially prevalent in the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima). Studies
   in the temperate region have shown that brood abandonment is influenced
   both by female body condition and brood size. In this study we tested
   how these two factors influenced the probability of brood desertion in
   ciders breeding under harsh conditions in the high Arctic (78degreesN).
   We found that females in poor body condition were less likely, to care
   for their young, but there was no effects of brood size. We speculate
   that the differences between southern and northern populations of ciders
   may be due to different environmental conditions. Received 10 October

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the Slender-billed Gull (Larus genei) is poorly
   known. Several reproductive parameters have been recorded during tell
   years (from 1992 to 2001) at the Ebro Delta (northwestern
   Mediterranean), such as Clutch size, egg size and breeding success, as
   well as the number of breeders during the study and their population
   dynamics, Average clutch size during the Study was 2.57 eggs per nest,
   with three eggs being the modal size. Slender-billed Gulls can lay a
   second clutch after egg loss, although clutch size is decreased. Mean
   egg size for the period 1998-2001 was 38.50 ml (SE +/- 0.11). Although
   breeding is highly synchronous, females laying first were probably those
   in best body condition. Average breeding success for the whole period
   was 0.71 chicks per nest (24\% of eggs laid). Compared with other
   Colonies, results suggest that oil average, the site may be a high
   quality colony in terms of availability of food, nest sited and
   predation rates. However, most of the breeding parameters analyzed
   showed statistically significant differences between years, and also
   between breeding areas and sub-colonies within the delta. The number of
   breeding pairs increased slightly front 388 in 1992 to 468 in 2001 (mean
   annual growth rate was 1.02 per year), although the rate fluctuated
   greatly between years, these changes were probably related to
   emigration-immigration processes at a metapopulation level. Received 1

   North America. About 74\%, of these birds nest at a single colony, East
   Sand Island, near the mouth of the Columbia River between Washington and
   Oregon. It is estimated by others that When the terns nested in 1998 on
   Rice Island. 26 km further east in the Columbia River estuary, they
   consumed Steelhead smolts (Oncorhynchas mykiss), Coho smolts (O.
   ksutch), and spring/summer Chinook smolts (O. tshawytscha) that reached
   the Columbia River estuary, thus involving species listed under the
   United States Endangered Species Act. In addition, because such a large
   percentage of the west coast population breeds at a single colony there
   is concern that a natural or anthropogenic event at this colony may
   adversely impact the entire Population. As a result, many federal,
   state, tribal and private natural resource managers are trying to
   develop a management plan to disperse a fraction of these terns front
   East Sand Island to other historic and/or newly created nesting sites
   throughout western North America. Among factors to be considered,
   managers must assess the potential impact that terns Would have on
   fisheries, especially salmonids, at potential relocation sites before
   attempts are made to relocate the birds. This study documents the diet
   of terns in one prospective relevation area. Commencement Bay,
   Washington, Relative abundance of prey species, including salmonids,
   delivered to the colony by adults differed significantly front month to
   month during the breeding season, but overall terns brought all average
   of 52\% juvenile salmonids back to the colony, a higher percentage of
   salmonids than are consumed by terns on East Sand Island. Therefore, we
   conclude that Commencement Bay may not be an appropriate relocation site
   for Caspian Terns. Received 2 October 2001, accepted 2 December 2001.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of Spain and Portugal within the European Community has
   brought about a change tit the traditional farming practices in the
   dehesas of Iberia to intensive cereal and to irrigated crops. Here we
   use seven year counts of Common cranes in 38 wintering sites to evaluate
   whether habitat structure modified by farming practices in the Holm Oak
   (Quercus Hex)dehesas is an important determinant of variability in
   winter crane numbers, We extracted. front a Set of nine variables that
   express different Ievels Of human management in the Holm Oak dehesas two
   factors,that accounted for the 66\% of the variance. The first factor
   was related to livestock utilization of the dehesas, while the second
   one reflected Holm Oak presence. We ran a general linear model to
   analyse the influence of farming practices (PC1 and PC2), landscape
   heterogeneity and roost site stability on inter- and intra-season
   variability in numbers of winter cranes. Livestock presence, Holm Oak
   presence, landscape heterogenieity and roost type stability did not
   explain intra- and inter- season variability in crane numbers wintering

Abstract = {{The present wintering range of the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis
   fulva) includes the northeastern Lip of Africa, southern Asia, to
   Australia and New Zealand and much of the Pacific Ocean. We summarize
   evidence from the oral history of ``Wilsternetters{''} (artisanal
   hunters using air ancient, specialized netting device to capture
   grassland-shorebirds in daytime), as well as written records, to suggest
   that, Until quite recently the wintering range of the Pacific Golden
   Plover may even have included the southern North Sea coast, mainly in
   the north of The Netherlands. Near the Zuiderzee (a large Dutch estuary,
   that was closed off front the sea in 1932 and is now known as Lake
   Ijsselmeer). the birds came inland to roost during spring tides, often
   in the company of Dunlin (Calidris alpina). However, Pacific Golden
   Plover were usually captured much further inland after the onset of
   severe winter weather, apparently after the birds had started moving
   away from their normal coastal winter habitat. Uniquely, Pacific Golden
   Plover wintering so far west and north appeared to show adaptations to
   cold (a thick and rather downy plumage) and unpredictable feeding
   conditions (a large fat store in midwinter). These special life-history
   features may have made it a distinct subspecies. Whether Dutch
   engineering, i.e. the loss of the Zuiderzee, played a role in their
   disappearance is probably beyond investigation. Received 17 October

   offshore of contiguous old-growth forest adjacent to relatively abundant
   offshore was strongly related to the prescence of large Clustered and
   unfragmented old-growth forests on nearby inland areas. Murrelets were
   most abundant offshore of contiguous old-growth forest adjacent to
   relatively abundant medium-sized, second-growth coniferous forests.
   Compared to the forest habitat, marine habitat was relatively,
   unimportant in determining murrelet abundance offshore high marine
   primary productivity and nutrients were not associated with high
   murrelet numbers, Tidal flat shorelines were weakly associated with more

Abstract = {{Data on the occurrence and frequency of adoption of chicks by adult Pied
   Avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta) were collected by monitoring
   individually color-banded chicks oil alkaline lakes in the Kiskunsdg
   National Park in central Hungary between 1998 and 2000. Fifty-three
   adoptions were observed. and 22\% of the resighted broods (N = 244)
   contained on average 1.7 (range 1-6) adopted chicks. Ninety-two chicks,
   or 13\% of the color-banded chicks (N = 697) were adopted. The frequency
   of adoption was similar among years and was positively related to the
   number of pairs within a colony. At least 60\% of the adoptions occurred
   in the nesting colonies, whereas adoptions during brood movements or in
   the brood-rearing areas, as well as brood amalgamations, were rare. More
   than two-thirds (68\%) of the adopted chicks in the colony left the
   natal brood and joined other bloods voluntarily. The remaining adopted
   chicks were the last to hatch in their own brood and were adopted into
   another brood after being left behind by their parents. Adults did not
   behave aggressively toward young alien chicks and always accepted them.
   Adoption appears to he initiated by chicks, in Pied Avocets, and it may
   be associated with small fitness costs, or may even provide benefits,
   for the adoptees or the adopting adults. Received 18 September 2001,

Abstract = {{Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) and Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus)
   partitioned feeding habitat based on wetland size at Peltier Lake
   rookery in cast central Minnesota. Great Blue Herons preferred large
   water-bodies ( greater than or equal to350 ha), whereas Great Egrets fed
   most often at small ponds (<25 ha). Forty-nine percent of Great Blue
   Herons used wetlands 301 - 400 hectares in size and 83\% of Great Egrets
   fed in wetlands <100 ha in size. Great Blue Herons selected large
   wetlands more often than expected both at the regional (30-km radius)
   and local (4-km radius) scales. Habitat use by Great Egrets was in
   proportion to availability at the regional scale, but they selected
   smaller wetlands for feeding more often than expected at a local scale.
   The median flight distance of Great Blue Herons was 2.7 km, similar to
   distances reported elsewhere. Great Egrets flew farther to feeding sites
   than Great Blue Herons, and flew farther (median = 13.5 km) than
   reported in other geographic areas. Received 22 September 2001, accepted

   (Cygnus buccinator) habitat (range 46,729 km(2) in 1968 to 123,857 km(2)
   in 2000). The total number of adult Trumpeter Swans increased from 1,924
   to 13,934 between 1968 and 2000, a 624\% increase. Population trends
   varied among eleven distinct geographical areas. Swan numbers increased
   in both high quality core habitat as well as in peripheral habitat added
   during the survey period. Although the Trumpeter Swan population
   summering in Alaska continues to grow, a comprehensive Alaska Trumpeter
   Swan Management Plan is needed to ensure that swans remain well

Organization = {{Waterbird Soc}},
Abstract = {{Integrated waterbird management over the past few decade has implicitly
   referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to
   enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading
   birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I
   describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial,
   temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management
   objectives. Spatial integration Simply expands the Scale of management
   concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of
   impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas,
   the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger
   landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on
   daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal
   integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management
   for waterbirds and commercial ``crops{''} (e.g., crawfish and rice) or
   for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in
   spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields
   in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with
   habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade.
   Identifying which wetlands are ``sources{''} or ``sinks{''} for specific
   populations provides managers with critical information about effective
   management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population
   models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for
   breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class.
   Population viability analysis models require much the same information.
   Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to
   optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may
   include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary
   land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and,, or
   water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an ``easy sell{''} (e.g.,
   public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands
   are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter
   case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder
   participation and education.}},

Abstract = {{During the period 1970-2000, substantial efforts were made to document
   the distribution and number of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) in
   western Canada. Breeding surveys have expanded from covering less than
   20,000 km(2) in the Grande Prairie region of Alberta to cover 780,000
   km(2), perhaps one-third of northwestern Canada. Aerial surveys
   involving total or partial counts have been used in most areas. Since
   1995, sample-based surveys have been used in Yukon Territory and extreme
   northern British Columbia. Between 1970 and 2000, breeding surveys have
   documented a dramatic increase in both breeding distribution and numbers
   in western Canada (100 to more than 3,700). Winter surveys in British
   Columbia have corroborated an increase in numbers on the southern coast
   (from 1,000 to at least 7,100) and in the southern interior (from 0 to
   504), and also documented changes in the wintering distribution. Most,
   if not all, the increase in wintering numbers on the southern coast has
   been in agricultural areas on Vancouver Island and in the delta and
   lower valley of the Fraser River.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relationship between water levels and accessible
   habitat, and how accessible habitat influenced Dunlin (Calidris alpina)
   and Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) numbers in managed
   wetlands at Pea Island (North Carolina) and Merritt Island (Florida)
   National Wildlife Refuges in 1998 and 1999. At Pea Island we
   experimentally manipulated water levels, which also allowed us to
   examine the effects of water level fluctuations on prey base. We
   examined these relationships because access to foraging habitat by
   shorebirds is positively related to the length of their tarsometatarsus,
   and in the southeastern United States, small calidrids are a numerically
   important component of the two million migrants using inland and managed
   wetlands. We confirmed the importance of shallow waters for Dunlin and
   Semipalmated Sandpiper-numbers increased with increasing availability of
   0-4 cm habitat, At Merritt Island, Dunlin use was inversely related to
   variability in water depth of 0-4 cm. Minimizing the frequency and
   amplitude of water level fluctuations associated with single-capped
   culverts is necessary to improve habitat quality. After adjusting for
   accessibility, spring habitat requirements for Dunlin and Semipalmated
   Sandpiper at Pea Island were met under nearly all abundance scenarios.
   We identified water level targets that maximize accessible habitat at
   Pea Island. In contrast, winter habitat requirements for Dunlin at
   Merritt Island were not met except in one scenario. Seasonally low prey
   density contributed to the shortfall, suggesting that allocating more
   habitat is the primary management option. Manipulating water levels at
   Pea Island did not adversely affect the density of eight shorebird prey
   species. Estimates of accessible habitat and other parameters (e.g.,
   turnover rates, prey biomass) are essential to set and implement
   realistic shorebird habitat conservation goals.}},

   columbianus) were monitored by two annual aerial surveys June and
   August) in the Kuparuk Oilfield and adjacent areas on the Arctic Coastal
   Plain of Alaska during 1989-2000. Tundra Swan numbers increased
   significantly at an annual rate of 4.8\% based on June counts of adults,
   and at 2.9\% based on August counts of adults. Individuals in pairs
   composed 81\% and 72\% of adults in June and August, respectively. Young
   swans composed 25\% of all swans recorded in August. Numbers of nests
   varied substantially among years ((x) over bar = 79, range = 44-116),
   and did not increase significantly over the study period. The density of
   nests was low ((x) over bar = 0.04 nests km(-2)), but except for higher
   densities on deltas, was comparable to other sections of the Arctic
   Coastal Plain. Mean annual nesting success (i.e., total broods per total
   nests) was 83\% (range 64\%-100\%) and mean brood size was 2.5 young per
   brood. The number of nests was positively correlated with cumulative
   thaw degree-days (cumulative number of degrees per day above freezing)
   during spring (15 May-15 June). No similar relationship was found for
   the total number of adults present in June or brood size in August.
   Abundance and productivity are compared to other Tundra Swan surveys in
   northern and western Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Most streams in the Upper Delaware Bay U.S.A. drainage have been
   impounded either historically or at present to accommodate a variety of
   wetland management objectives. Long-term impoundment has resulted in
   loss of wetland function and biodiversity. Nevertheless, extensive
   wetlands in Salem County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware
   provide habitat for many important waterbirds, including breeding wading
   birds, migratory shorebirds, and waterfowl. Public and private agencies
   in both states have initiated wetland restoration programs to improve
   habitat values for multiple waterbird groups. I conducted wetland
   studies in nine streams to examine patterns of waterbird use to 1)
   identify water level management practices that promote waterbird
   utilization, and 2) develop guidelines for resource managers to meet
   integrated wetland management objectives. A total of 62 species (32,100
   individuals) of wading birds, waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds,
   marshbirds, and raptors was recorded April-July, 1993-1996 and 2000
   during weekly observations. Most waterbird groups were more abundant at
   impounded sites than at tidal sites in streams. In addition, the use of
   streams within the region varied for all waterbird groups indicating
   that some streams were highly utilized while at others, relatively few
   waterbirds were present. Water level management regime vas an important
   factor in determining waterbird use. Wading birds were most abundant at
   wetlands undergoing a mid-season drawdown at which time many
   locally-breeding species were meeting adult and nestling food
   requirements. Waterfowl were more abundant at wetlands with relatively
   high water levels in early spring compared to levels later in the
   season. which coincided with duck migration. Migratory shorebirds were
   most abundant on wetlands with relatively low water levels during May.
   Results 1) confirm the need for variably-managed wetland mosaics which
   provide habitat at a variety of beater levels and 2) identify the
   importance of timing of drawdown in meeting the foraging needs of
   multiple waterbird groups.}},

Abstract = {{Population indices from the Midwinter Waterfowl Survey show that the
   number of Eastern Population Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus
   columbianus) has more than doubled since 1955 and currently exceeds
   100,000. Numbers of swans wintering in Maryland, in the vicinity of
   Chesapeake Bay, continue to decline while numbers wintering further
   south along coastal North Carolina steadily increase. North Carolina
   winters an average of about 70\% of the Eastern Population, while
   Maryland has 20\%, Virginia 6\%, NewJersey 3\% and elsewhere 1\%. No
   long term productivity trends are evident in the observed age-ratios and
   numbers of young per family. Currently, Montana, North Carolina, North
   Dakota, South Dakota, and Virginia issue up to a total of 9,600 swan
   hunting permits annually (one swan per permit). The percentage of the
   population harvested was lowered in 1996 from 10\% to 5\% to stimulate
   population growth. Presently, nearly 4,000 birds are taken by hunters
   annually (40\% success rate). Although population growth has slowed
   since the initiation of hunting in 1984, the trend remains positive and
   appears to be increasing after lowering the harvest rate. Thus, at
   current population levels, we believe that the Eastern Population is
   capable of sustaining a limited harvest while still ensuring future
   growth, ecological integrity, and other recreational opportunities to
   benefit society.}},

Abstract = {{The Icelandic-breeding Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) population winters
   almost exclusively in Ireland, Britain and Iceland. A coordinated census
   of Whooper Swans in these countries was undertaken in January 2000,
   following previous coordinated censuses in 1986, 1991 and 1995. Of the
   20,856 birds recorded, 43\% were in the Republic of Ireland, 18\% in
   Northern Ireland, 19\% in England, 14\% in Scotland and 6\% Iceland,
   with the combined totals for Wales and the Isle of Man accounting for
   <1\%. Age assessments revealed 16.8\% cygnets, with a mean brood size of
   2.3; cygnet distribution was highly consistent between countries and
   regions in Britain and Ireland, but the proportion of young was lower
   and more variable between regions in Iceland. The census total was the
   highest to date, and represents an increase in numbers of 32\% since
   1995. There is little evidence that immigration of birds from the
   population wintering in continental northwest Europe is sufficient to
   explain the increase. The increase of 32\% in population size between
   1995 and 2000, together with productivity levels of 18.1\% cygnets per
   annum, suggests an average annual mortality rate of 11.8\% over the
   period. The increase in numbers occurred mainly in Ireland and England.
   This resulted in an increase in the number of flocks, and also in flock
   size, in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In England,
   birds appear to have become concentrated at traditional sites, and
   particularly at the two principal sites, Martin Mere and the Ouse
   Washes. Most birds were found on grassland habitats (although the
   proportion varied between countries) and on permanent water. As in
   previous censuses, the proportion recorded on arable habitats was low
   and, although higher in Britain, is localized there.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland and grassland habitats of the northern Great Plains are a
   primary breeding ground for waterbirds in North America. Native mixed
   grass prairies that were historically used for cattle grazing have met
   with changing social and economic pressures that put the remaining 40\%
   of this resource at high risk of tillage. In this paper, we describe the
   current state of our waning rural societies, characterize impacts of
   land use change on waterbird habitats, and discuss conservation actions
   to benefit waterbirds. Recent population statistics indicate that a
   record number of farmers facing low commodity prices are selling their
   farms and moving to urban centers for employment. Other farmers are
   shifting from diversified agriculture to monoculture grain farming to
   take advantage of farm programs that provide incentives to bring
   marginal land into production. Additional data indicate that concurrent
   changes in crop types have decreased quality of farmland wildlife
   habitat while bigger and faster farm equipment and genetically modified
   crops continue to make farming marginal land less risky. Legislators and
   administrators should be advised that waterbird habitat loss continues
   to expand westward. The last chance to sustain the unique
   grassland-wetland character of the northern Great Plains is to
   accelerate grassland conservation with short- and long-term stewardship
   programs and incentives to family ranches. This philosophy is of vital
   importance because it also protects wetland habitats that otherwise are
   vulnerable to drainage when native prairie is converted to cropland.
   Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, this would conserve our prairie
   heritage for future generations while preserving the private property
   rights of landowners.}},

Abstract = {{The number of Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) molting at Lake Myvatn,
   Iceland, was monitored for 27 years, from 1974 to 2000. For most of this
   period, Lake Myvatn held the largest concentration of Whooper Swans
   molting on freshwater in Iceland, although larger numbers are found on
   coastal bays and brackish lagoons. Two lakes less than 50 km from Myvatn
   that also receive molting Whooper Swans have been monitored since 1989.
   The numbers of Whooper Swans molting in the general region (4,500 km(2))
   were probably stable from 1974 to 1998. On Lake Myvatn, molting numbers
   averaged 470 21 (SE) in the period 1974-2000. There was considerable
   short-term variation in numbers between years, perhaps for demographic
   reasons or because of changes in food availability. At Lake Myvatn,
   molting swans occurred mainly in two bays, with different bottom
   vegetation, and numbers on each bay varied inversely from year to year.
   Numbers molting on Lake Myvatn showed a linear declining trend, with an
   average loss of 10.5 individuals per year. This decline correlated
   significantly with a reduction in the size of the available habitat due
   to underwater strip-mining (diatomite extraction), which increased the
   depth of the macrophyte zone to a level that no longer supported the
   plant species mainly eaten by molting Whooper Swans.}},

   wetland birds. In 1999-2000, we surveyed 196 stock ponds within
   grassland (>95\% grass) and cropland (>75\% tillage) landscapes to
   evaluate effects of land use on nongame wetland bird densities in
   western South Dakota. Land use and wetlands were delineated from Landsat
   TM imagery and National Wetlands Inventory maps. Sixteen nongame wetland
   bird species used stock ponds in western South Dakota. of which nine
   species were obligate wetland-nesting species. Although densities of
   seven nongame obligate wetland bird species were similar between
   landscape types, abundance of Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor)
   was greater in grassland study areas where cattle grazing limited growth
   of thick-stemmed emergent vegetation and reduced overall vegetative
   cover in stock ponds. In contrast, the Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius
   phoeniceus) and Yellow-headed Blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus)
   were more abundant in cropland landscapes where stock ponds provide
   abundant over-water nesting habitat (e.g., cattail). If grasslands
   continue to be converted to cropland, Wilson's Phalarope numbers will
   likely decrease as blackbird densities increase in stock ponds dominated
   by monotypic stands of cattail. To circumvent such changes, we recommend
   that resource managers conserve large tracts of grassland through
   aggressive easement programs in landscapes at highest risk of
   agricultural tillage.}},

   the results of the country-wide surveys is attributable to the birds
   using more terrestrial habitats since the early 1980s, which are less
   well covered by the IWC. In 1995, 33\% of the swans were found on land,
   compared to 43\% in January 2000. For the Mute Swan, the midwinter

   shorebirds, waterfowl, marshbirds, and seabirds utilize rice fields for
   foraging and to a lesser extent as bleeding sites. In some areas,
   especially Asia, waterbirds have come to rely upon rice fields as

Abstract = {{A large proportion of the Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) that winter in
   continental northwest Europe stage in Estonia during migration. Spring
   staging areas often overlap with those of the Bewick's Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus bewickii) migrating to arctic Russia. Whooper Swans occur in
   internationally important numbers (>600 birds) at seven wetland sites in
   spring, and eight sites are of national importance (100-600 birds).
   During the 1990s, up to 5,700 and 3,900 swans were counted at the key
   staging sites of Matsalu Bay and Haapsalu Bay respectively. Flocks are
   smaller (often <50 birds) and more scattered during autumn migration but
   two wetlands, Haapsalu Bay and Matsalu Bay, again hold internationally
   important numbers, with tip to 3,900 and 1,200 individuals at this time.
   The Whooper Swan is a regular but innumerous wintering species,
   occurring in low numbers in coastal areas. In hard winters up to 300
   birds and in mild winters up to 1,000 birds have been recorded in
   Estonia. There is no clear trend in the number of swans present in
   winter. The first breeding attempt by Whooper Swans in Estonia was
   recorded in 1979, a steady increase in the number of breeding pairs was
   recorded during the 1990s and the number currently breeding is estimated
   at 30-40 pairs. Breeding habitats are natural and artificial pools
   (dyseutrophic lakes), raised bogs (43\% of breeding attempts), eutrophic
   inland lakes (31\%) and coastal lakes and bays (26\%). Flocks of molting
   swans (mainly non-breeding birds) have been observed in western Estonia
   since 1993.}},

Abstract = {{Rice and/or crawfish are cultivated in over 225,000 ha of shallow
   earthen impoundments within 160 km of the Gulf of Mexico along the coast
   of Louisiana. The region includes both the Gulf Coastal Plain and
   Prairie and the Lower Mississippi River Valley. Annual loss of 4.475 ha
   of coastal wetlands in Louisiana due to subsidence, erosion, and rising
   sea level has significantly reduced desirable freshwater habitat in the
   region. The suite of resident, migrant, bleeding, and wintering
   waterbirds depending on this region includes grebes, pelicans,
   cormorants, anhingas, wading birds, waterfowl, coots, rails, gallinules,
   shorebirds, gulls, terns, and kingfishers. These taxa utilize the
   artificial freshwater wetland habitat provided by the agricultural
   wetlands. Numerous other birds utilize riparian areas associated with
   these artificial wetlands. Crawfish ponds are especially valuable cool
   season habitat for predaceous waterbirds because they provide shallow
   water systems rich in invertebrate and small vertebrate prey during the
   period from mid-autumn through mid-spring when most rice fields are
   drained. Because most crawfish ponds are not drained until late spring
   or early summer, predictable, food-rich, shallow water waterbird habitat
   is available throughout the region when rice fields are being cultivated
   for rice production. Incorporation of crawfish management into
   government-sponsored land conservation programs should encourage land
   owners to sustain standing water habitat outside of program mandated
   fill/drain requirements. Farmers could adjust the times when their
   impoundments are filled or drained to maximize benefits to many species,
   especially migrating shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews current and historical literature, and also
   original data, with a view to describing changes in the southern limit
   for Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) breeding in northwest Russia. The
   swans were more numerous in the region, and their distribution more
   widespread, in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century than
   they are today. In the mid 20th century, increased human activity
   resulted in a substantial decline in numbers, with breeding pairs no
   longer occurring in parts of central Karelia, nor in the Leningrad
   region in southern Karelia. A gradual increase in numbers began in the
   1980s, and their breeding distribution shifted southwards. The
   southernmost sites where Whooper Swans breed regularly are now at
   62degrees10'N in west Karelia (on the Russian-Finnish border), much
   further north (at 63degrees20'N) in central Karelia, but further south
   again (at around 62degreesN) where Karelia meets the Arkhangelsk region.
   Further east, regular breeding occurs across the Kargopol district of
   Arkhangelsk, from 61degrees45'N in the west to 61degrees20'N at its
   southeast border with the Vologda region (at Lake Lacha). Irregular
   breeding occurs across southern Karelia and the northern part of the
   Leningrad region. The change in the southern limit of the swans'
   breeding distribution cannot, however, be considered an expansion of the
   breeding range because the swans have not yet fully returned to the
   range occupied in the first half of the 20th century.}},

Abstract = {{The numbers of Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) and Bewick's Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus bewickii) wintering in Japan have increased in recent
   decades. Annual winter counts show a steady growth in the last twenty
   years. Swans arrive in Japan from mid-October onwards, and up to 32,000
   Whooper Swans and 31,000 Bewick's Swans have been recorded in mid-winter
   in the late 1990s. This is more than 50\% of the East Asian populations
   of these two species. In addition, 150 feral Mute Swans (Cygnus olor)
   reside in Japan throughout the year. There is a long tradition of
   providing rice and bread for swans in Japan, and the number of
   supplementary feeding sites has increased since 1980. Food for swans and
   other waterfowl is now distributed at nearly 300 locations; about 55\%
   of the wintering swans are found at these sites. Unlike in Europe and
   North America, no conflicts with farming interests have been reported.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the world, coastal salt ponds provide habitat for large
   numbers and diversities of waterbirds. San Francisco Bay contains the
   most important coastal salt pond complexes for waterbirds in the United
   States, supporting more than a million waterbirds through the year. As
   an initial step in attempting to understand how the anticipated
   conversion of salt ponds to tidal marsh might affect the Bay's bird
   populations, the number of birds using salt ponds on high and low tides
   was counted during the winter months of 1999/00 and 2000/01. Behavior
   and habitat use of birds in these ponds were assessed, and the effects
   of tide cycle, pond salinity, and pond area on bird use were examined.
   We recorded 75 species of waterbirds in surveys of salt ponds in the
   South Bay from September 1999 to February 2001 totaling over a million
   bird use days on high tide. Shorebirds and dabbling ducks were the most
   abundant groups of birds using the salt ponds. Waterbird numbers and
   diversity were significantly affected by the salinity of ponds in a
   non-linear fashion with lower numbers and diversity on the highest
   salinity ponds. With the exception of ducks and Eared Grebe (Podiceps
   nigricollis), tide height at the Bay significantly affected bird numbers
   in the salt ponds with ponds at high tides having higher numbers of
   birds than the same ponds on low tides, Considerable numbers of birds
   fed in the salt ponds on high and low tides, although this varied
   greatly by species. Habitat use varied by tide. Management
   recommendations include maintaining ponds of varying salinities and
   depths. Restoring salt ponds to tidal marsh should proceed with caution
   to avoid loss of waterbird diversity and numbers in San Francisco Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial surveys of breeding and non-breeding Bewick's Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus bewickii) and Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) were made in
   north European Russia in 1980, 1981, 1991 and from 1996 to 2000. There
   was a significant increase in the density of territorial Whooper Swan
   pairs on the Pechora Delta over this period, whereas the density of
   Bewick's Swan pairs on open tundra on the Russkiy Zavorot Peninsula,
   some 50 km further north, was stable. Additional surveys of Whooper
   Swans breeding in forest tundra to the south of the main study areas
   showed that nesting density in this region was much lower than for the
   Pechora Delta. The proportion of territorial pairs with nests varied
   substantially between years for both species. In Whooper Swans, the
   ratio of territorial breeding pairs to non-breeding pairs also changed
   substantially between June and July, particularly in 1998 and 1999, but
   there was little seasonal variation in the proportion of territorial
   pairs breeding recorded for Bewick's Swans during the study. Extensive
   surveys conducted in 1980, 1981, 1991 and 1999-2000 indicated that
   56\%-73\% of Whooper Swans and 54\%-62\% of Bewick's Swans in the region

Abstract = {{The San Francisco Bay estuary is a migration and wintering area for more
   than 1.5 million waterbirds on the west coast of North America. Because
   the estuary is located in a metropolitan area, development and diking of
   baylands (the region between the edge of the bay and the historical high
   tide line) have greatly altered the wetland landscape. Recently,
   conservation interests have promoted restoration of diked baylands to
   tidal salt marshes for the benefit of endangered native species.
   However, effects of tidal marsh conversion Oil the existing community of
   waterbirds in the baylands are largely unknown, especially, in muted
   tidal marshes with restricted inflows and in artificial salt evaporation
   ponds where high waterbird densities are found The first radio-marking
   study of the Long-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus) was
   conducted in November-December 2000 to examine their use of baylands. We
   captured 32 birds by rocket netting in a muted tidal marsh on the North
   Bay and radio-marked them with 1.2 g transmitters affixed With glue.
   Individuals Were tracked for all average of 20.3 d (+/- 8.5 SD) and
   obtained 217 high tide and 195 low tide locations. Movements between
   tides ( x = 1.29 +/- 1.48 SD km) and home range sizes ((x) over bar =
   17.7 +/- 16.0 SD km(2)) were highly variable. Long-billed Dowitchers
   preferred open habitats Such as muted tidal marshes during the high
   tide, but the majority (78.5\%) also remained ill these wetlands during
   low tide rather than feeding at nearby Fund flats. Their avoidance of
   mud flats contrasted sharply with Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri)
   but was similar to Black-necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus). Seven
   Long-billed Dowitchers flew 110 km inland to Central Valley wetlands in
   mid-December, a regional movement documented earlier for Dunlin
   (Calidris alpina) wintering on the coast. However, unlike Dunhill, their
   Movements were not in response to rainfall but may have been in response
   to a low pressure front or possibly predictable flooding of Fields in
   the Central Valley. Although the estuary is a major wintering area
   supporting large numbers of waterbuds, some birds such as Long-billed
   Dowitchers move inland to freshwater wetlands in the Central Valley.}},

Abstract = {{The Lena Delta is one of the key areas for Bewick's Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus bewickii) breeding in northern Asia. Aerial censuses,
   carried out during the period 1963-1994, showed that swan abundance
   decreased from 4,200 to 700 individuals between 1963-1983, then
   increased again to 6,000 individuals. The negative correlation between
   swan abundance and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) numbers over this period
   was not significant, but further monitoring of the possible effects of
   Reindeer numbers is warranted. During 1994-2000, swan distribution,
   numbers and breeding biology were studied on foot and by boat. The
   phenology of spring and autumn migration, seasonal distribution of
   breeding and non-breeding birds within the Lena Delta, breeding dates,
   features of nest biology and the potential relationship between breeding
   Success and environmental factors are described. Mean brood size
   correlated with mean temperature during the pre-breeding period.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of swan species in the Siberian Arctic, from the Gydan

   (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) numbers increased in all areas from the
   Yamal Peninsula to Chukotka, and its previously fragmented range is now
   continuous. A total of about 66,200 Bewick's Swans spend the summer on
   Eurasian tundra, of which about 60\% are in Siberia. The Whooper Swan
   (Cygnus cygnus) has expanded its range northwards and eastwards during
   the last ten years. Breeding concentrations occur further north than
   30-40 years ago, and the species now nests on open tundra as well as in
   forest-tundra and taiga zones. The Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus
   columbianus) has expanded its breeding range to both west and south in
   Asia. They now occupy an area extending along 500 km of the north coast
   of Chukotka, and total numbers in Russia are estimated at 600-1,000
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{The North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) supports the
   conservation of significant amounts of wetland in the Northern Atlantic
   region. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture, which uses Act funds to
   implement wetland habitat protection in the region, has expanded its
   goals to include conservation of all wetland birds. We conducted field
   surveys at all 30 completed NAWCA project sites between Virginia and
   Maine, its well as at comparable wetland sites on other publicly owned
   land, to determine the waterbird species using the sites during the
   spring migration and breeding season. We compared species diversity and
   abundance at NAWCA sites and comparable reference wetlands. In addition,
   we compared the species found on each NAWCA sit to the list of species
   predicted for the site in the project application, corrected for the
   season of the survey. In general, NAWCA sites had comparable numbers of
   species and individuals relative to the reference sites, although some
   species occurred more frequently at NAWCA sites. Lists of species
   predicted to occur on the site had very low similarity with species
   actually recorded, so additional approaches are needed to predict which
   potential future projects would make the highest contribution to
   waterbird diversity. However, most waterbird species identified as high
   priority in bird conservation plans for the region did not occur at
   either the NAWCA or reference sites. Inclusion of additional habitat
   types that were uncommon at NAWCA sites, particularly including shallow
   mudflat and coastal shoreline, would likely improve the success of the
   program in providing habitat for high-priority waterbird species.}},

   impacts oil waterbirds. Degradation of wetlands and associated upland
   habitats, and associated impacts oil several duck and rail species are
   ell documented. Wetland restoration and management are essential for
   wildlife diversity because of the magnitude of wetland destruction and
   hydrological modification that has occurred in most of the United
   States. Half of threatened and endangered species rely, upon wetlands
   for some portion of their life cycle, underscoring the importance of
   wetlands to all wildlife. Ducks Unlimited, during its 65-year history of
   conservation programs, has restored, protected, and enhanced nearly 4.05
   million hectares of wetlands and associated uplands in North America.
   Despite the accomplishments of Ducks Unlimited and its private, state,
   provincial and federal partners, the perception remains that our efforts
   benefit only water fowl. However, wildlife inventories oil Ducks
   Unlimited projects indicate benefits to more than 900 species, Herein,
   we promote an integrated, habitat-based landscape approach to wetland
   restoration and management, lather than individual species management,
   to achieve biodiversity and sustainable ecosystem objectives. We discuss
   the development of wetland restoration and management strategies for
   quality wetland complexes needed for waterbirds during their annual life
   cycles. Further, We underscore the importance of wetland management by
   our state, federal and private land partners to manage wetland complexes
   to provide high quality habitat for a wide array of wetland wildlife.}},

   America have made unprecedented progress in the last 15 years.
   Integrated bird conservation is a process that maximizes effectiveness
   and efficiency of conservation delivery for all migratory and resident
   birds. Beginning with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service has a history of supporting geographic
   integration of management programs. Modern Northern American
   perspectives must broaden to include larger geographic scales, novel
   private-public partnerships, stronger inter-governmental relationships,
   greater development of a conservation culture, and consideration of all
   resident and migratory bird species. The North American Bird
   Conservation Initiative provides a mechanism for developing new
   resources and optimizing existing resources. Full integration of bird
   conservation efforts in North America, and beyond, is our best hope of
   achieving conservation of migratory bird resources in future decades.}},

   the effect of increased rainfall associated with an El Nino event on
   Black-necked Swans (Cygnus melancoryphus) at El Yali National Reserve,
   an important coastal wetland of the Mediterranean region of Chile. The
   Black-necked Swan is a regular winter visitor to the El Yali wetland
   but, during and after El Nino years, it increases markedly in number,
   stays longer (throughout the summer) and breeds. During and after El
   Nino years, El Yali has more swans and higher breeding productivity than
   at other known breeding sites in central Chile. Consequently, after El
   Nino events, the El Yali wetland may be a source from which swans
   colonize other wetlands in the Mediterranean and Austral regions of
   Chile.}},

Abstract = {{The Bewick's Swan's (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) spring migration route
   from Lake Nakaumi, southern Japan, was studied using satellite telemetry
   in 1994 and 1997. Of four birds tracked in 1994, one crossed the Sea of
   Japan and covered 900 km in 13 h on 31 March. It reached the mainland
   near Vladivostock, then headed north via Khanka Lake and the Saujiang
   Plain in China to the mouth of the Amur River in northern Russia. The
   distance from the wintering site to its summer site was about 2,000 km.
   The three other swans, followed for shorter periods in 1994, were
   recorded at various points along the Japanese Islands. Of a further four
   swans fitted with satellite transmitters in 1997, two crossed the Sea of
   Japan. One of these then headed north to the mouth of the Amur River,
   following a very similar route to the bird tracked in 1994. The other
   two swans followed a route along the islands of Japan, heading north
   until mid April when their transmitters failed. These observations
   suggest that Bewick's Swans wintering at Lake Nakaumi follow at least
   two migration routes in spring, one along Japanese islands, and the
   other directly across the Sea of Japan.}},

   Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) and Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator)
   pre-selected migration routes using ultralight aircraft. When Canada
   Geese were trained to follow an ultralight aircraft for southward autumn
   migrations of 680 or 1,320 km, 81\% (83/103) returned on their own in
   the next spring to near their place of training. In contrast, none
   returned of 21 similarly raised geese that were transported south in a
   closed truck over a route of 680 km. Trumpeter Swans have proven more
   difficult to train. However, in two experiments in which Trumpeter Swans
   followed an ultralight for the entire pre-selected route, one of three
   and two of four returned close to their training area. A stage-by-stage
   method, in which swans were transported in trucks between stops, flown
   in the vicinity and penned with a view of the night sky, has shown some
   promise. So far an established migration route (north and south twice)
   has been confirmed in only two geese.}},

Abstract = {{During 1990-1996, Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) were translocated
   from high-risk wintering sites in the Greater Yellowstone Region of
   Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to potential new wintering areas in Idaho,
   Wyoming, Oregon, and Utah in an attempt to broaden winter distribution
   and reduce the vulnerability of the Western Canada and Greater
   Yellowstone breeding populations, which winter primarily in Greater
   Yellowstone. Survival and movements of 1,127 neck-banded swans
   translocated in 1990-1995 were monitored to determine their use of new
   wintering areas in years after translocation. Survival estimates were
   hindered by uneven resighting effort and lack of data on neck-band loss,
   however, at least 683 swans, including 71\% of adults and 50\% of
   cygnets, survived at least one year after translocation. Of these 683
   swans, 62\% subsequently wintered away from the monitored Greater
   Yellowstone winter habitats. By 1997, persistent use by >50 wintering
   swans existed at only two of eight release sites. We conclude that
   Trumpeter Swans would establish greater use of new wintering sites if
   winter translocations, primarily of juveniles, were made to sites (1)
   that have adequate ice-free food and low human disturbance, (2) that are
   situated directly south of currently occupied winter habitat, and (3) at
   which obvious mortality factors, such as shooting and power lines, are
   minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Long Point, Lake Erie, is an important spring and autumn staging area
   for Eastern Population Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus).
   Habitat use and trend in numbers of Tundra Swans at Long Point were
   assessed using data from twelve Tundra Swans fitted with satellite
   transmitters and tracked locally, aerial surveys of swans on water
   (1971-1999), and roadside surveys of swans in fields (1998-2000). Mean
   peak autumn aquatic counts at Long Point increased from 442 Tundra Swans
   in the 1970s to 7,177 in the 1990s. The proportion of the Eastern
   Population of Tundra Swans rising Long Point during peak one-day autumn
   counts increased from <1\% in the 1970s to nearly 8\% in the 1990s. In
   contrast, there was no change in peak spring aquatic counts. Tundra
   Swans were located in agricultural fields more often in spring (74\% of
   diurnal satellite locations) than in autumn (9\%). During spring, most
   (65\%) swans using terrestrial habitats were observed in corn (Zea mays)
   fields, whereas during autumn, most (67\%) were in winter wheat
   (Triticum duriem) fields. Seasonal differences in use of fields appeared
   to influence wetland habitat use; during spring, when agricultural
   fields were used extensively, Tundra Swans were located in those aquatic
   habitats that were closest to fields. However, during autumn, when
   aquatic plants were their primary forage, swans tended to use aquatic
   habitats closer to the tip of Long Point. Given the potential for Tundra
   Swans to influence the structure of waterfowl communities and aquatic
   habitats, and the overall lack of information about staging Tundra
   Swans, further research into the ecological importance and use of spring
   and autumn stopover sites is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The Upper Mississippi River is an autumn stopover site for the Eastern
   Population of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus). A total of
   37 aerial surveys and ten video surveys were conducted along 180 km of
   this river in the autumn of 1998 and 1999 to estimate swan numbers,
   percentage of young and brood sizes. Numbers peaked during late November
   and swans were present on the river in substantial numbers (>5,000) for
   nearly two months. Calculations suggest that 52\% of the Eastern
   Population cygnets and about 25\% of all Eastern Population swans used
   the study area during autumn migration. Video surveys indicated that
   breeders arrived later than non-breeders in autumn migration and that
   average brood size was 1.9 in 1999. Based on 43 radio-marked swans
   tracked every two to three days, the average length of stay was 33.6
   days. The turnover rate (swans using the study area/peak number recorded
   in the study area) was low, 1.29 in 1998 and 0.94 in 1999. These
   findings suggest that the Upper Mississippi River is an important autumn
   stopover site for the Eastern Population of Tundra Swans, and may be
   especially important for cygnets.}},

Abstract = {{Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) grazing on winter wheat
   (Triticum duriem) were studied using 61 sets of paired plots (one
   exclosure, one subject to grazing) in fields near a major wintering area
   in North Carolina during 1995-1996. Aboveground biomass, number of seed
   heads, and seed head mass were determined for each plot and used as
   measures of grain yield; plant height and leaf damage on each plot were
   used to assess grazing intensity. Tundra Swans reduced aboveground
   biomass by 12\% and seed head mass by 11\% in grazed plots compared to
   exclosure plots. More blades were grazed and plant height was reduced in
   grazed plots compared to exclosure plots in each month after plot
   deployment, with the greatest reduction in plant height (28\%) occurring
   in February, and a final reduction of 6\% at the time of harvest in
   June. However, these differences in crop yield and plant height occurred
   only in plots on sanctuary fields, in which swans can feed without
   disturbance from farmers or hunters, but not in plots on non-sanctuary
   fields.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of grazing by Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) on agricultural
   grasslands in winter were investigated in northwest Ireland. Exclosure
   cages were used to compare aboveground biomass in ungrazed plots with
   those grazed by swans. Grazing intensity was measured by recording
   cumulative dropping densities in fixed plots. Measurements of
   aboveground biomass were made on three occasions: midwinter (January),
   early spring (late March) and late spring (late May) at two different
   study sites in different years. There were significant yield losses
   between grazed and ungrazed plots for each sampling period. These were
   highest in spring when losses of up to 65\% were recorded. Swan grazing
   intensity was positively correlated with yield losses and aboveground
   biomass and the correlation was especially strong in late. spring. Geese
   were also present in fields at one of the study sites and, while they
   also had a significant effect on biomass, swan grazing had a
   proportionately stronger effect. While the results illustrate the
   potential severity of grazing by swans, they should be interpreted with
   caution as previous studies have shown the interactive effects of a
   range of variables, including weather conditions, which make it
   difficult to predict the response of a sward to grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat availability and usage by Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) and Whooper
   Swans (Cygnus cygnus) was studied in the valley of the River Tweed in
   Scotland from 1996-1999. Monthly surveys were undertaken to describe the
   seasonal variation in numbers of swans and their choice of habitat, with
   particular reference to potential factors affecting choice of individual
   agricultural fields. Mute Swans were present throughout the year, with
   highest numbers in winter, and lowest numbers during April-August.
   Whooper Swans were present from October-April. Both species fed on
   agricultural crops during winter, with Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus)
   fields the favored habitat from December-March. Whooper Swans also
   showed some preference for winter cereals when in single species flocks,
   while river vegetation was also important for Mute Swans. Analysis of
   field choice showed that, although crop type (Oilseed Rape) was the
   dominant factor, swans also chose larger fields and those closer to
   water. Neither boundary features nor potential sources of disturbance
   were significant in influencing field selection. Implications for the
   management of conflict between swans and farmers include the potential
   to reduce the likelihood of damage by swans through planting Oilseed
   Rape in smaller fields away from water. An alternative approach would be
   to set aside sacrificial fields, the location and size of which could be
   chosen to be the most attractive combination for grazing swans.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variation in the numbers, distribution and behavior of Mute
   Swans (Cygnus olor) between two Danish brackish lagoons, Agger Fjord (a
   molting site) and Harboor Fjord (a wintering site), was investigated
   each year from 1994-1999 to determine factors influencing feeding
   activity and site selection. Water depth, water level fluctuations and
   biomass of aquatic macrophytes differed between sites, with macrophyte
   composition and food quality, measured as the proportion of carbohydrate
   and protein in the vegetation, also differing widely between sites.
   Rising water levels and declining food availability during autumn
   affected feeding intensity and foraging methods. Feeding depth on
   Harboor Fjord influenced spatial distribution of swans, whereas the
   distribution was influenced by distance to the shore on the shallower
   Agger Fjord. Distance to areas open to hunting had no influence on
   distribution. Several factors appeared to affect the swans' selection of
   Agger Fjord as a molting site. The macrophyte community was dominated by
   highly nutritious Stoneworts (Chara spp.) and average water depth was
   very low, making more food available within reach of the birds.
   Furthermore, human disturbance was low and undisturbed islands provided
   escape routes for flightless birds and refuges suitable for preening and
   roosting. During autumn, swans left the molting ground as the food stock
   was depleted, and moved to Harboor Fjord, which offered the best
   foraging opportunities in winter. Here the macrophyte community
   consisted of Spiral Tasselweed (Ruppia cirrhosa) and, although of low
   food quality, the food stock was abundant. It is suggested that water
   levels at Harboor Fjord be managed so that submerged macrophytes are
   more readily available for Mute Swans.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes factors affecting the size of the Mute Swan (Cygnus
   olor) colony breeding at Abbotsbury, Dorset, a site free from most of
   the common causes of mortality encountered by swans occurring elsewhere

   of the breeding adults, which varies with year and has increased with
   time. The proportion of birds known to have bred, but which fail to
   breed in any year, varies from 2\% to 28\%. The number of new breeders
   in any year is dependent on cygnet survival in their first year,
   together with the age at which they start to breed. New breeders tend to
   start breeding at a younger age in years when conditions for breeding
   seem good (as judged by an increase in the breeding population over the
   previous year); the reasons for the differences between good and poor
   years are not known. Despite the site being apparently ideal for the
   swans, the overall survival and longevity does not differ greatly from
   Mute Swans studied elsewhere in the UK.}},

Abstract = {{The occupancy of territories, and the breeding success of pairs on these
   territories, was recorded for Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) nesting at
   Skagafjordur, northern Iceland, from 1988 to 2000 inclusive. Complete
   information on occupancy was obtained for 83 (66\%) of 125 territories
   located during the 13-year study. Territories were occupied (by one or
   more pairs) for an average of 7.4 years; 31\% were occupied for three
   years or less and 31\% for most of the study (12 or 13 years). The
   number of years that Whooper Swans occupied territories was influenced
   by the area of open water on the territory, but not by the proximity of
   the nearest nesting pair. There was also a positive correlation between
   the number of years in which a territory was occupied and annual
   breeding success (measured as clutch size) for pairs on the territories.
   Monitoring of individuals showed that only one territory was occupied by
   the same pair throughout the study, and that 35\% of pairs were present
   for only one season. Territories occupied for most years not only
   received more pairs, but the average duration of occupancy (in years) by
   the same pair was also higher for these sites. Further information on
   habitat quality is needed to determine the reasons underlying variation
   in frequency of occupancy and breeding success.}},

   categories: peatlands, oligotrophic lakes and eutrophic lakes. Cygnets
   reared in peatlands and oligotrophic lakes were significantly lighter
   (35\% and 20\% respectively) and had shorter skull lengths (12\% and 6\%
   respectively) than cygnets from cutrophic lakes, when measurements were
   adjusted for differences due to age. The estimated age at fledging for
   cygnets from peatlands and oligotrophic lakes were, on average, 18 days
   and 10 days later respectively than for cygnets from eutrophic lakes. It
   is suggested that differences in growth rates and age at fledging can be
   explained by differences in the availability and nutritional quality of
   food in the three types of habitat. Survival differed significantly
   between habitats; 52\% of cygnets from peatlands were recorded on the
   wintering grounds, compared with 77\% and 76\% from oligotrophic and
   eutrophic lakes. Cygnets resighted on the wintering grounds were, on
   average, 640 g heavier when banded in August than cygnets not resighted.
   This suggests that differences in the survival of cygnets from the three
   habitat categories were attributable to territory quality influencing
   the cygnets' growth, which in turn may affect their survival into the
   first winter.}},

   breeding on Vaygach Island (70degrees15'N, 58degrees46'E), Russia was
   studied in 1986-1988 and 1995-1997. In particular, the effects of spring
   weather conditions on the rise of old nests, breeding density and clutch
   size were considered. A total of 127 nests were found over the six-year
   period. All nests were mapped, clutch size was recorded and the eggs
   were weighed and measured. Bewick's Swan nests occurred across the
   island in different types of habitat. Nest density varied from 0.12 to
   0.36 nests km(-2). Mean clutch size, which varied from 2.4 to 3.3 eggs,
   was significantly smaller than clutch sizes recorded in mainland Russia
   and negatively correlated with the date of clutch initiation. Calculated
   fresh egg mass varied depending on the timing of spring and the cold
   snaps. Nest failure was mostly due to abandonment of nests in cold
   weather rather then to predation. Climatic conditions in spring are the
   main determinants of nesting success for swans on Vaygach Island.}},

Abstract = {{Annual aerial surveys of nesting Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus
   columbianus) were conducted during 1989-2000 on the Kuparuk and Milne
   Point oilfields and adjacent areas of the central Arctic Coastal Plain
   of northern Alaska. Spatial analysis indicated that swans selected nest
   sites close (less than or equal to100 m) to large lakes (20-33 ha) and
   that nests were clumped in distribution each year, although nests on
   average were greater than 2.5 km apart. The clumped distribution of
   nests suggests that suitable habitats for nesting swans are not randomly
   distributed in the study area. Mean distance of nests to the Beaufort
   Sea coastline ranged annually from 11.1-14.5 km. Waterbodies near nests
   had significantly higher shoreline complexity each year than the closest
   waterbodies to random locations. Complex shorelines (i.e., small coves
   or sheltered areas) provide areas suitable for emergent vegetation such
   as Pendant Grass (Arctophila fulva), a dominant species in preferred
   foraging habitat in northern Alaska. Photographs of Tundra Swan nests,
   taken over a seven-year period, were used to characterize nest-site
   habitats at both macrotype and microtype scales. Nests primarily were
   located on the driest microtypes and on macrosites associated with
   lakes, usually within 20 m of the lake shore. Nest sites afforded good
   visibility and early exposure during spring thaw. Among the 89 swan
   territories that had at least three years of use, swans used the same
   mound each year in 36\% of territories and used a different mound each
   year in 12\%; swans in remaining territories used the same mound in some
   years and new mounds in others. Studies such as cuts may be useful for
   evaluating the impacts of oil development, and for planning and
   permitting future developments in new regions on the Arctic Coastal
   Plain of Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting ecology of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) was
   studied along the Kashunuk River near Old Chevak (61degrees26'N,
   165degrees27'W), on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska from
   1988-2000. Annual variation in snow-melt chronology, nesting phenology,
   nesting density, clutch size and nest success was examined. The same
   area (approximately 23 km(2)) was searched each year and nests were
   found as early as possible in the laying period. Laying initiation dates
   ranged from 1-27 May and hatch dates from 12 June-4 July among pairs and
   years of study. The peak arrival of Tundra Swans and the phenology of
   nest initiation and hatch were highly correlated with the progression of
   ice and snow melt in spring. Nest density averaged 0.71 km(-2) and 89\%
   of nesting pairs hatched at least one egg. Incubation period ranged from
   26 to 33 days with a median of 30 days. Clutch size varied significantly
   among years, driven by a low mean value of 3.4 eggs in 1999. Clutch
   sizes were generally larger than found in previous investigations on the
   Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and nearly one egg larger than reported for
   clutches from Alaska's North Slope (approximate to70degreesN). There was
   no indication of reduced clutch size in years of late spring snow melt,
   although nesting density tended to be lower.}},

Abstract = {{Migratory behavior and abundance of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus
   columbianus) were studied from 1977 to 1996 at two adjacent sites on the
   lower Alaska Peninsula. Winter re-sightings of swans captured and neck
   banded during molt revealed that swans from one site (Pavlof) were
   consistently migratory while those from the other (Izembek) were
   essentially resident during 17 of 20 years when they wintered at nearby
   Unimak Island. Large emigrations occurred from Izembek in three
   consecutive years to winter sites in the U.S. Pacific Northwest where
   swans from Pavlof and elsewhere also wintered. There was no indication
   of mixing between swans from Izembek and Pavlof on the breeding grounds
   or Alaskan wintering grounds. The average number of swans on Izembek and
   Pavlof breeding grounds was 212 +/- 34 (0.20 +/- 0.03 swans per km(2))
   and 586 +/- 77 (0.31 +/- 0.05 swans per km(2)), respectively. Breeding
   habitats appeared similar, however, densities of total swans and
   breeding pairs were 35\% and 48\% higher at Pavlof. Emigrations from
   Izembek resulted in 37\% and 94\% declines in numbers of swans on the
   breeding grounds and Alaskan wintering grounds. The number of swans at
   Izembek recovered at 19\% per year following emigrations to near normal
   numbers. At Pavlof, where swans were consistently migratory, densities
   did not show the same patterns of variation as those at Izembek.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes variation of egg size in Mute Swans (Cygnus olor)
   nesting on fishponds in the Barycz valley, Poland, determines
   repeatability in mean egg volume of the same females nesting in
   consecutive breeding seasons, and determines if egg size influences
   hatchability, chick body size, mass and survival. Within a clutch, the
   smallest egg was laid first or last in the laying sequence. Differences
   in volume between eggs within a clutch were significant for all
   categories of clutch size. Mean egg volume in a clutch did not vary
   significantly between years for the same females nesting in consecutive
   breeding seasons, and was not related to female body size. Repeatability
   of mean egg dimensions in the next breeding seasons was 0.69-0.75. Later
   onset of laying was correlated with laying smaller eggs. On average, a
   delay in laying the first egg corresponded with a reduction in mean egg
   size of 1.8\% per each 10 days. Unhatched eggs were not significantly
   smaller than eggs that produced chicks. Large eggs produced larger and
   heavier cygnets. Egg volume explained about 70\% of the variation in
   cygnet body mass and 18-38\% of the variation in body size measured at
   one day of age. Mean egg volume in a clutch influenced cygnet survival
   to age 100 days.}},

Abstract = {{Non-energetic and energetic constraints have been used to explain
   asynchronous molt in breeding pairs of waterfowl. This study of Mute
   Swans (Cygnus olor) in the Barycz valley of Poland during 1990-1995
   describes the timing of female molt in relation to timing of hatch,
   clutch size, body weight and condition at the end of incubation, and the
   timing of her mate's molt. Females (N = 89) initiated molt from 20 June
   to mid-August. Female date of molt initiation was significantly related
   to hatch date and body condition at the end of incubation. Females
   started molt on average 46 days after the hatching of her eggs. The
   hatch-to-molt interval was positively related to body condition at
   hatch. Males (N = 102) initiated molt from mid-July to the first of
   September. Males in poorer body condition initiated molt later. There
   was a positive correlation between female and male molt dates within a
   pair. Males began molt on average 28 days later than their mates (N =
   52). In addition to energetic constraints of reproduction and molt, the
   delay of molt by breeding females is likely to be influenced by the need
   to brood cygnets and protect them from predators. The delay of molt by
   breeding males is likely to be influenced by the need to protect cygnets
   from predators and the need to protect mates and territories from
   conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Among studies that have quantified the care of precocial young, few have
   investigated forms of parental care other than vigilance. During the
   pre-fledging period, Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus columbianus)
   parents provided simultaneous biparental care by foraging near each
   other and their cygnets, and cygnets spent more time foraging during
   bouts in which both parents were foraging nearby than when only one
   parent was foraging nearby. Parents spent nearly twice as much foraging
   time on land than did non-parents, a habitat in which cygnets foraged
   more intensely than parents (i.e., spent more time foraging during
   foraging bouts) and could graze on protein-rich sedges rather than use
   more difficult below-water foraging methods. Parents also spent more
   than twice as much time being vigilant and more than three times as much
   time defending their territory than non-parents, behaviors that
   presumably benefited cygnets by decreasing predation risk and indirect
   foraging competition, respectively. Parents therefore incurred the costs
   of foraging less intensely during foraging bouts, spending more time
   interacting, more time in vigilance, and less time sleeping/preening
   than non-parents.}},

   200 km south of Santiago, Chile. In all families, both parents were
   vigilant and aggressive toward conspecifics and, in one location,
   territories were defended throughout the season. In most cases, both
   parents still accompanied their first broods until the end of the study
   period, when the oldest broods were four to five months old and flying.
   Males spent less time feeding than cygnets, and spent more time in
   aggressive activities than females. Two females began incubating a
   second clutch 40-50 days after hatching broods of eight and seven
   cygnets, with second broods containing seven and three cygnets,
   respectively. In both of these families, the male accompanied the first
   brood while the female incubated the second clutch. In the first case,
   both parents were aggressive towards the first brood and preferentially
   accompanied the second brood, whereas in the other case, the first and
   second broods formed one large family accompanied by both parents. These
   two families, especially the male parents, differed in the percentage of
   time spent in a number of activities. The overall activity pattern of
   one pair differed depending on whether they were attending one or two
   broods. Further study is needed to document the frequency of
   double-brooding, the ecological and social factors that favor it, and
   parental care of first broods.}},

Abstract = {{Activity budgets of wild Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) nesting in
   interior Alaska were recorded in 1982 and 1983. Analysis of these time
   budgets were used to quantify and compare the behavior of females, mates
   and broods during incubation, hatching and brood-rearing. Male behavior
   changed little during the breeding season; however, they fed less and
   were alert more during hatching than during either incubation or
   brood-rearing. Females interrupted incubation sessions only to feed and
   occasionally to assist males in chasing intruding swans. Females
   initiated recesses during incubation usually when males were near the
   nest. Males attended nests during their mates' absence, but were never
   observed to sit on the eggs. During brood-rearing, behavior of females
   and males was similar, but cygnets spent more time feeding and resting,
   and less time preening and being alert, than did parents. Activity
   budgets are compared to those from other studies of wild Trumpeter Swans
   and Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) in Alaska.}},

   eggs. In addition, two instances of egg-laying were witnessed at close

   final emergence took just over two minutes. Trumpeter Swans lay very
   small eggs in proportion to their body size, and their large feet can

Abstract = {{By the beginning of the 20th Century, North America's once widespread
   and abundant populations of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) had been
   devastated by overharvest and were nearing extinction. By the close of
   the century, due to growth of remnant populations and restoration
   efforts, over 23,000 Trumpeter Swans existed in the wild. Large portions
   of vacant historic breeding habitats in Canada and the United States
   remain suitable for future reoccupation, however, traditional migration
   patterns to southerly wintering areas have been disrupted, winter
   habitat has been reduced in quantity and quality, and some populations
   that depend upon marginal winter habitat are vulnerable to high winter
   mortality. To maintain current populations and allow for growth, we
   recommend protecting and improving current winter habitat, creating new
   wintering sites, and developing methods to establish use of these areas.
   Particular emphasis should be placed on using the National Wildlife
   Refuge System to provide secure focus areas for expansion of migration
   and winter distribution and exploring ways to create additional
   wintering habitat in partnership with agricultural interests.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) to their former range
   in Ontario has involved many techniques, some more successful than
   others. Rearing methods included cross-fostering on wild Mute Swans
   (Cygnus olor), artificial incubation, and incubation and rearing by
   their own Trumpeter Swan parents. Egg hatchabilily was low ((x) over bar
   = 56\%) for eggs laid by captive pairs and was suspected to be due to
   inbreeding. Few toxic contaminants were found in unhatched eggs, but
   15-17\% of unhatched eggs that had been artificially incubated were
   infertile. Eggs cross-fostered under wild Mute Swans had lower
   hatchability than those incubated by Trumpeter Swans, and cygnets raised
   by Mute Swans survived less well to fledging. Time budgets revealed that
   rearing methods significantly influenced behavior but differences
   disappeared by 26 weeks of age. However, wild-hatched swans, when
   adults, bred somewhat but not significantly more frequently than those
   hatched by their own, captive parents. Translocating adult wild-caught
   Trumpeter Swans did not prove to be an effective reintroduction
   technique; none of the six translocated adults were resighted after the
   first year. Annual survival rate of wild-hatched males and females more
   than 2 years old was 0.831; survival rates did not differ between
   captive- and wild-hatched swans in any age or sex category. The most
   common cause of death was lead poisoning. Released Trumpeter Swans bred
   for the first time at two to eight years of age. Four adults were taught
   to follow an ultralight aircraft to a predetermined wintering site. They
   returned on their own in the spring but did not migrate back to the
   wintering site during the next autumn.}},

Abstract = {{A decision support system for the management of the Rocky Mountain
   Population of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) is being developed. As
   part of this, three expert systems are also in development: one for
   assessing the quality of Trumpeter Swan breeding habitat; one for making
   water level recommendations in montane, palustrine wetlands; and one for
   assessing the contribution a particular site can make towards meeting
   objectives from a flyway perspective. The focus of this paper is the
   development of the breeding habitat expert system, which currently
   consists of 157 rules. Our purpose is to provide decision support for
   issues that appear to be beyond the capability of single persons to
   conceptualize and solve. We propose that by involving multiple experts
   in the development and use of the system, management will be
   significantly improved. The knowledge base for the expert system has
   been developed using standard knowledge engineering techniques with a
   small team of ecological experts. Knowledge was then coded using
   production rules organized in decision trees using a commercial expert
   system development shell. The final system has been deployed on the
   world wide web.}},

Abstract = {{A Bayesian time series analysis technique, the dynamic linear model, was
   used to analyze counts of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) summering
   in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming from 1931 to 2000. For the Yellowstone
   National Park segment of white birds (sub-adults and adults combined)
   the estimated probability of a positive growth rate is 0.01. The
   estimated probability of achieving the Subcommittee on Rocky Mountain
   Trumpeter Swans 2002 population goal of 40 white birds for the
   Yellowstone segment is less than 0.01. Outside of Yellowstone National
   Park, Wyoming white birds are estimated to have a 0.79 probability of a
   positive growth rate with a 0.05 probability of achieving the 2002
   objective of 120 white birds. In the Centennial Valley in southwest
   Montana, results indicate a probability of 0.87 that the white bird
   population is growing at a positive rate with considerable uncertainty.
   The estimated probability of achieving the 2002 Centennial Valley
   objective of 160 white birds is 0.14 but under an alternative model
   falls to 0.04. The estimated probability that the Targhee National
   Forest segment of white birds has a positive growth rate is 0.03. In
   Idaho outside of the Targhee National Forest, white birds are estimated
   to have a 0.97 probability of a positive growth rate with a 0.18
   probability of attaining the 2002 goal of 150 white birds.}},

   influx of birds occurred during May and June as birds came to the site
   from the surrounding area to molt. The origin of molting birds was
   restricted by local geography; ground higher than 200 m above sea level
   appeared to reduce movement to the site. The sex ratio and age ratio of
   the flock did not vary significantly throughout the year. Primary
   feathers grew at a rate of 6.1 mm per day, and age, sex and body
   condition did not influence the rate of feather growth. Status had an
   impact on the timing of molt, with resident birds molting earlier than
   migrants. Body condition varied throughout the year. Age, sex and month
   were all significant factors in explaining variation in body condition.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroduction efforts have established small, scattered flocks of
   Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) in the Midwestern United States.
   Management of these flocks as distinct population units is debated among
   wildlife managers. The purpose of this study was to quantify generic
   differences among three recognized populations of Trumpeter Swans. Blood
   and tissue samples were collected during 1999 and 2000 and analyzed
   using horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis. Trumpeter Swans from the
   High Plains Flock and the Greater Yellowstone Population, from which the
   High Plains Flock was derived, were genetically indistinguishable.
   However, both flocks differed from the Pacific Coast Population in
   allele frequencies at the adenosine deaminase (ADA) locus. Founder
   effects may have influenced both the High Plains Flock and the Greater
   Yellowstone Population. Results also suggest unidirectional gene flow
   from the Pacific Coast Population into the other populations. The High
   Plains Flock may be a suitable source of individuals to increase the
   size of the Greater Yellowstone Population while maintaining similar
   allele frequencies. Additional higher resolution genetic surveys are
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and Tundra Swans (C. columbianus
   columbianus) in captivity produce hybrid offspring that are visually
   similar to their parent species. In this study, call note vocalizations
   of Trumpeter Swans, Tundra Swans, and their hybrid offspring were
   analyzed for differences in call duration and initial low frequency.
   Sixty-five locator vocalizations were digitally recorded from four
   Trumpeter Swans, four Tundra Swans, and seven known Trumpeter-x-Tundra
   Swan hybrids. Call duration did not differ significantly among swan
   types ((x) over bar = 200.5 mS +/- 53.3 {[}SD], N = 65). However, the
   initial frequency of the locator call was significantly lower in the
   Trumpeter Swan ((x) over bar = 303 Hz +/- 73 {[}SD]) than in the Tundra
   Swan (5 = 479 Hz 89 {[}SD]). Initial low frequency of hybrid swan
   locator calls was intermediate ((x) over bar = 398 Hz +/- 58 {[}SD]) and
   did not differ significantly from either parent species. This suggests
   that the duration of the locator call does not vary among these swan
   species or their hybrids. However, the initial low frequency of the
   locator call differs in the two species and their hybrids demonstrate
   intermediate values.}},

Abstract = {{Lead from spent gunshot and discarded anglers' weights continues to pose
   a threat to Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) in Europe. In many parts of the
   world, lead is still widely used in fishing and hunting, and in areas
   where it is banned previous losses still pose a threat. We collected 590
   blood samples from ringed Mute Swans between October and January over
   six winters: 1983-84 to 1986-87 inclusive, 1994-95 and 1999-2000. Most
   samples were collected from swans wintering at Cork Lough, Ireland, an
   urban site where coarse fishing is popular, while a smaller number were
   collected from swans at rural sites within a 50 km radius of Cork Lough.
   The median blood lead levels in swans at Cork Lough declined from 36.2
   mug/100 ml in 1983-84 to 12.1 mug/100 ml in 1999-2000. There was also a
   significant decline in the proportion of birds suffering from acute lead
   poisoning (>40 mug/100 ml of whole blood), from 60\% in the winter of
   1985-86 to 2\% in the winter of 1994-95. A significant decline in the
   median blood lead level of Mute Swans in rural areas, from 49.7 mug/100
   ml in 1984-85 to 7.7 mug/100 ml in 1999-2000, was also noted. The
   decline in the median blood lead level and in the proportion of birds
   suffering from acute lead poisoning is most likely explained by a
   combination of factors, including the provision of grit at Cork Lough.

Abstract = {{During the peak of the Trumpeter Swan (Cygnus buccinator) restoration
   programs in Minnesota and Wisconsin, in 1988-1990, many swans developed
   lead poisoning. Drought conditions allowed the birds access to spent
   lead shot in lakes and refuges. At least 94 swans developed lead
   poisoning, 63 were treated, of which 29 were successfully treated and
   released. The birds that were successfully treated were normal on
   physical examination, had blood lead levels in the normal range and no
   longer had radiographic evidence of lead shot in their gastrointestinal
   tract. In all, 23\% of free-flying birds were successfully treated for
   lead poisoning compared to 67\% of captive (previously pinioned or
   wing-clipped) birds. Six of 29 swans successfully treated for lead
   poisoning were confirmed to reproduce two to 10.5 years after treatment.
   Males and females were equally likely to reproduce after treatment for
   lead poisoning. Only one of 20 cygnets successfully treated was
   confirmed to reproduce compared to five of nine birds treated as
   subadult/adults (1-2 years or greater than or equal to2 years of age).}},

Abstract = {{From 1989 to 1999, I examined intraseasonal and annual chan-es in the
   abundance and local distribution of two groups of wintering Dunlin
   (Calidris alpina) occupying different positions along hydrographic
   gradient: in the Tomales Bay estuary, California. Reciprocal
   translocation of color-banded Dunlin indicated a discrete separation of
   wintering Dunlin between the north and south of Tomales Bay. Local
   abundance in both groups was significantly associated with cumulative
   seasonal rainfall within and among years. Increased variation in annual
   and intra-seasonal abundance was related to reduced tidal circulation,
   greater freshwater stream flow, and increased salinity variation. On
   average, winter Dunlin use peaked later but declined earlier in the
   southern part of the bay (near the head of the bay) than in the northern
   part of the bay (near the mouth of the bay). Shifts in distribution
   associated with changes in hydrographic conditions and weather revealed
   consistent intra-seasonal changes in habitat preference on temporal
   scales other than tidal cycles. In the northern part of the bay, changes
   in habitat preference by Dunlin corresponded to thresholds of 20-25 cm
   cumulative rainfall and 0.5-1.0 m(3) sec(-1) stream flow, whereas in the
   south bay changes were relatively continuous. Rainfall, wind velocity
   and direction, and temperature also influenced habitat preferences.
   Flocking behavior dominated over habitat choice at low levels of Dunlin
   abundance, resulting in contrasting patterns of habitat use relative to
   overall trends. These patterns suggested the loss of habitat quality as
   the criterion for patch use. In general, this study indicates that
   winter shorebird use of temperate estuaries can be predicted by
   differences in weather and hydrographic regimes, including rates and
   variances of freshwater inflow, estuarine circulation, and water
   residence times unique to each system.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated wading bird productivity in four estuaries from Delaware
   Bay to Boston Harbor in northeastern U.S.A. over the period 1986-1998.
   To document and characterize reproductive performance of numerically
   dominant species for use in wildlife and habitat management planning, we
   recorded 1) number of eggs laid, 2) percent of eggs hatched, 3) percent
   of hatchlings surviving 10-15 days post-hatch, 4) number of nestlings
   produced, and 5) factors of offspring mortality in nests of
   Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Snowy Egret (Egretta
   thula), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), and Glossy Ibis (Plegadis
   falcinellus). We randomly selected 30-50 nests of each species (as
   available) for study at colonies in Delaware Bay (1993-1998), New York
   Harbor (1986-1994), Cape Cod (1990-94), and Boston Harbor (1993-94). In
   addition, we recorded abundance of nesting wading birds and Asian
   predators in most years of study. Colony size ranged from 120-8,300
   nests. Clutch size of all species was greater at northern-most sites.
   Loss of eggs varied between estuaries for all species except Glossy
   Ibis. Hatching success ranged from 75-88\% and differed between
   estuaries for Black-crowned Night Heron and Gloss), Ibis. Hatchling
   survival ranged from 16-87\% and was lowest in Delaware Bay for all
   species. Nestling production was lowest in Delaware Bay for all species.
   In general, predation was high in Delaware Bay and egg in-viability was
   high in Boston Harbor. Predation of nestlings was greatest in Delaware
   Bay for Cattle Egret, but there were no differences between estuaries
   for other species. Proportions of avian predators to nesting herons did
   not explain high predation rates in Delaware Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) are threatened seabirds
   that nest in coastal old-growth coniferous forests throughout much of
   their breeding range. Currently, observer-based audio-visual surveys are
   conducted at inland forest sites during the breeding season primarily to
   determine nesting distribution and breeding status and are being used to
   estimate temporal or spatial trends in murrelet detections. Our goal was
   to assess the feasibility of using audio-visual survey data for such
   monitoring. We used an intensive field-based survey effort to record
   daily murrelet detections at seven survey stations in the Oregon Coast
   Range. We then used computer-aided resampling techniques to assess the
   effectiveness of twelve survey strategies with varying scheduling and a
   sampling intensity of 414 surveys per breeding season to estimate known
   means and SDs of murrelet detections. Most survey strategies we tested
   failed to provide estimates of detection means and SDs that were within
   +/- 20\% of actual means and SDs. Estimates of daily detections were,
   however, frequently estimated to within +/- 50\% of field data with
   sampling efforts of 14 days/breeding season. Additional resampling
   analyses with statistically generated detection data indicated that the
   temporal variability in detection data had a great effect on the
   reliability of the mean and SD estimates calculated from the twelve
   survey strategies, while the value of the mean had little effect.
   Effectiveness at estimating multi-year trends in detection data was
   similarly poor, indicating that audio-visual surveys might be reliably
   used to estimate annual declines in murrelet detections of the order of
   50\% per year.}},

Abstract = {{In 1997, one of the strongest recorded El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) events occurred in the eastern Pacific. It caused strong oceanic
   and climatic anomalies, such as high sea surface temperatures (SST) and
   heavy rainfall along the eastern Pacific coast. We investigated the
   effects of this event on the reproductive ecology of the Neotropic
   Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) in central Chile (36 degrees 37'S;
   73 degrees 03'W) by comparing the pre-El Nino season in 1996 with the
   1997 El Nino year. Fish landings immediately prior to the 1997 breeding
   season were notably lower and rainfall increased. In 1997, the number of
   breeding pairs declined by 71\% from the previous year. During El Nino,
   laying started 15 days later, was less synchronized and ended 35 days
   later. Although egg size, clutch size and hatching success did not
   differ significantly between the two years, the decrease in the breeding
   numbers in 1997 would have caused a considerable drop in offspring
   production. We suggest that poor environmental conditions may have
   caused young or poor quality birds to miss breeding in the El Nino year.
   Since it appears that large El Nino events are becoming more frequent,
   it is important to undertake more research into the ability and
   mechanisms of seabirds to cope with them.}},

Abstract = {{We studied possible genotoxic exposure in Roval Terns (Sterna maxima) by
   collecting blood from adults and juveniles at five breeding colonies in
   coastal North Carolina in 1999. These colonies are located in three
   estuarine systems (Core Sound, Pamlico Sound, and Cape Fear River), each
   subjected to different contaminant loads. DNA in red blood cells was
   analyzed using the comet assay to determine levels of DNA strand breaks,
   a technique previously not applied to birds. In addition, we weighed
   each bird and estimated its fat reserved as an indication of nutritional
   health. Gross health assessments showed no significant differences
   between study sites, both for adult and juvenile terns. The comet assay
   indicated that blood cells from the adult and juvenile terns from two
   Core Sound colonies, Wainwright and Sand Bag Islands, had significantly
   higher levels of apparent DNA damage than the remaining study sites.
   Based on previously published studies of sediment contaminants, the Core
   Sound colonies have relatively low overall pollutant loads, a finding
   contrary to the expected result based on the DNA damage. Plausible
   explanations for these finding are that birds from the Core Sound are
   exposed to an undetected genotoxic contaminant(s) or that birds from the
   more polluted sites have had an adaptive response to the contaminant
   exposure.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the foraging ecology of Royal Terns (Sterna maxima) and
   Sandwich Terns (S. sandvicensis) in North Carolina during the breeding
   seasons in 1999 and 2000. Foraging habitats were surveyed using 95
   fixed-point observations (30-45 min each) and over 100 h of inshore and
   offshore transects. Stable isotopes (C-13:C-12, N-15:N-14, and
   O-18:O-16) in eggshells were analyzed for evidence of differences in
   foraging habitats. Water masses were delineated using satellite imagery
   of sea surface temperatures. We determined diet for each species with
   observations of chick provisioning and fecal analyses. Although Royal
   and Sandwich Terns nested together in the same colonies, their prey and
   foraging habitats differed. Sandwich Terns fed their chicks 48\%
   anchovies (Anchoa sp.), 39\% herring (Clupeidae)/jacks,
   (Carangidae)/mackerels (Scombridae), and 9\% drums (Sciaenidae)/porgies
   (Sparidae) mullets (Mugil sp.), and foraged primarily in the marine
   coastal environment. Conversely, Royal Terns provided their chicks with
   9\% anchovies, 30\% herring/jacks/mackerels, and 41\%
   drums/porgies/mullets, and fed more frequently in the estuary. The
   species' foraging ranges overlapped at inlets and the river mouth.
   Stable isotope ratios also suggested that foraging differences occurred
   between colonies. The results of this investigation indicate that Royal
   and Sandwich Terns in North Carolina partition food resources by habitat
   and prey choice.}},

   found seasonally than between natural and created sites. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling of avian abundance separated Mustang Island
   from Nueces Delta. Cluster analysis of behavior of Black-bellied Plover
   (Pluvialis squatarola), Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus),
   ``peeps{''} (Calidris minutilla, C. pusilla), and Willet (Cataptrophorus
   semipalmatus), showed no clear differences in their behavior on natural
   and created sites. Mustang Island sites were more similar to each other
   than to Nueces Delta. All created sites had natural hydrology and tidal
   circulation, which appear to facilitate invertebrate and avian
   recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of fish-eating birds are commonly observed near
   aquaculture facilities in the southern United States. An understanding
   of the relationships between these birds and specific commodities is
   needed to interpret and manage bird impacts to aquacultural production.
   We conducted two foraging experiments to evaluate the preference of
   Great Egrets (Ardea alba) for three specific size classes of Channel
   Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). During six no-choice feeding trials,
   egrets consumed significantly more small (7.5-10 cm) fingerlings than
   medium (15-18 cm) or large (23-25 cm) catfish. Egrets captured 19 large
   catfish, and ingested only two, even when no other fish were available.
   During two-choice trials, Great Egrets significantly preferred small
   fingerlings to medium-sized fish, and medium-sized catfish to large
   fish. Handling time was directly related to the size of catfish
   ingested. Handling time was inversely related to the number of catfish
   ingested from each size class, particularly when Great Egrets were given
   a choice between two catfish size classes. Thus, we infer that the ease
   of capture and physical defenses (e.g., catfish spines) associated with
   particular foods affect Great Egret foraging preferences. Management of
   Great Egret impacts to aquacultural production should focus on
   dispersing egrets from ponds containing small (< 18 cm) Channel Catfish,
   rather than generalized dispersal at all ponds on all farms.}},

Abstract = {{Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) in Lake Mikri Prespa nest on
   islands of Common Reed (Phragmites) rhizomes formed at the interface
   between marsh and open water and mostly ranging from 6-80 m(2) in area.
   Nest density from 1984 to 1996 varied from 0.12 to 1.2 nests/m(2). Large
   islands were no more densely occupied than smaller ones. Higher nest
   densities were observed in the second and third year that a site was
   used. Islands used for nesting sere degraded by wether, water and use by
   the birds and shrank in size by 1-55\% each year; thus some were
   abandoned and new ones colonized each year. On the average, sites were
   used for three years in succession, but initially larger sites were used
   much longer. Nest site quality was related to island rigidity and the
   availability of nesting material on it. Numbers of breeding pelicans at
   Prespa are probably limited by the availability of suitable nest sites
   and, especially, larger islands, since breeding success is positively
   correlated with the mean nesting assemblage size (number of breeding
   attempts/number of sites. Artificial nesting rafts are likely to be more
   successful the more their features comply with the above findings and
   the more they enhance overall colony compactness.}},

Abstract = {{Although forage quality strongly affects gosling growth and consequently
   juvenile survival, the relative use of different plant communities by
   brood rearing geese has been poorly studied. On the Yukon-Kuskokwim
   Delta, Alaska, population growth and juvenile recruitment of Emperor
   Geese (Chen canagica) are comparatively low, and it is unknown whether
   their selection of habitats during brood rearing differs from other
   goose species. Radio-telemetry was used to document the use of habitats
   by 56 families of Emperor Geese in a 70 km(2) portion of the
   Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta during brood rearing in 1994-1996. When contrasted
   with available habitats (a set of six habitat classes), as estimated
   from 398 random sampling locations. Emperor Geese strongly selected
   Saline Ponds, Mudflat, and Ramenskii Meadow habitats and avoided Levee
   Meadow, Bog Meadow, and Sedge Meadow. These selected habitats were the
   most saline, comprised one-third of the study area, and 45\% of all
   locations were in Ramenskii meadow. I contrasted these Emperor Goose
   locations with habitats used by the composite goose community, as
   inferred from the presence of goose feces at random locations. The
   marked difference between groups in this comparison implied that
   Cackling Canada Geese (Branta canadensis minima) and Greater
   White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons) collectively selected much
   different brood rearing habitats than Emperor Geese.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by wintering Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) in Lijiang
   Lashihai Lake of southwest China was studied from 1 November 1999 to 29
   April 2000. We divided habitats into five types-deep water, shallow
   water, mudflat, grassland and farmland. Shallow water and grassland,
   with rich food and easily accessible water, were preferred by wintering
   Ruddy Shelducks, Farmland was preferred in mid-winter but avoided in
   early winter and late winter. Even in mid-winter, the feeding Ruddy
   Shelduck on farmland were not equally distributed in fields and
   preferred wet fields (just irrigated) and avoided dry fields. In dry

Abstract = {{We examined the flexibility in feeding ecology of Steller's Eider
   (Polysticta stellen) by comparing its diet to the taxonomically
   relatively close Long-tailed Duck (Clangula hyemalis) during two winter
   periods (early and late) when the two species occurred together.
   Steller's Eider generally fed on the same type of prey in early and late
   winter, with a dietary overlap of 43\% between the two periods (57\%
   among shelled prey). The mean number of prey species per bird was 7.8 in
   both early winter and late winter. In contrast, the Long-tailed Duck
   changed completely from feeding on benthic invertebrates in early winter
   to spawning Capelin (Mallotus villosus) in late winter. The dietary
   overlap between the two bird species was 38\% in early winter. In early
   winter, the mean number of prey species was 5.5 in the Long-tailed Duck,
   and not significantly different from the Steller's Eider. Steller's
   Eider seemed to be restricted to small prey, both compared to
   availability of sizes and also to the prey size taken by the Long-tailed
   Duck. Thus the worldwide rare Steller's Eider seems to be a specialist
   with limited ability to exploit different food resources, while the
   numerous Long-tailed Duck is an opportunistic generalist. Low
   flexibility in feeding ecology indicates that winter habitats for
   Steller's Eider may be limited, and protection of these areas would
   probably benefit the species.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the diet of the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) in three
   consecutive years (autumn 1998, autumn 1999 and summer 2000) by
   analyzing 642 pellets collected at Punta Rasa, Samborombon Bay, Buenos
   Aires, Argentina. Fish was the main prey in the diet (occurrence =
   100\%), while insects were present in only 2.7\% of samples. Among the
   14 fish species identified, Argentine Anchovies (Engraulis anchoita)
   (occurrence = 38.7\%, N = 31.5\%), Silversides (Odontesthes spp.)
   (occurrence = 38.3\%, N = 26.2\%) and White Croakers (Micropogonias
   furnieri) (occurrence = 11.6\%, N = 20.5\%) were the most important
   prey. Fish prey averaged 77 mm in length (+/- 34 mm, range 15-169 min, N
   = 123), and had an average mass of 6.9 g (+/-7.3 g, range 0.1-31.6 g, N
   = 123). Marked differences were observed in the frequency of occurrence
   and numeric importance of the fish prey species found in the three
   sampling seasons; while typical marine fishes, such as the Argentine
   Anchovy, constituted the bulk of the diet during 1998, estuarine
   juvenile fish prevailed in 1999 and 2000. The comparison of size and
   mass of prey between seasons also revealed large differences. Fishes
   caught in 1998 were significantly larger and heavier than those caught
   in other seasons. The diet of skimmers overlapped with that of South
   American Terns (Sterna hirundinacea), Royal Terns (S. maximus) and
   Sandwich Terns (S. sandvicensis) in the area during 1998, when prey was
   mostly marine fish.}},

Abstract = {{Many birds move at night, and although there is strong potential for
   collisions with stationary structures, the behavior of birds in response
   to such structures is poorly understood. We studied the nocturnal
   interactions of waterbirds with a 550v transmission powerline in the
   flat, open landscape of the Florida Everglades using a combination of
   surveillance radar to detect incoming birds, and night vision optical
   equipment to observe flight behavior. During 118 hours of observation we
   recorded a total of 285 flocks of ciconiiform birds crossing the
   powerline during spring 1997. We visually observed 663 birds in 187
   flocks, and documented their response to the powerline. We found that
   the flight directions and the colony site locality strongly suggested
   regular nocturnal foraging behavior of some species, especially
   Black-crowned Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Wood Storks
   (Mycteria americana). Birds flying at night were less likely to react to
   the powerline, suggesting that powerlines may pose more of a collision
   threat during darkness. However, we also found that waterbirds flew
   higher at night than during the day and thus came into a zone of
   potential contact with the powerline much less often than during the
   day.}},

Abstract = {{Choice of daily flight routes by Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser

   during October-February in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. Two types of
   route were considered: flight lines over power lines standing in the
   rice fields and flight lines over power lines partially concealed in
   woodland. Although food availability (size of rice fields within 12 km
   of the lake beyond the rice fields) was similar for direct flight lines
   beyond the two positions of the power lines, the proportion of geese
   flying over the power lines standing in the woods was appreciably and
   significantly higher than those in rice fields. In some cases, the geese
   took an indirect flight route to avoid crossing the power lines in the
   rice Fields. It is evident that the position and ``exposure{''} of power
   lines affect the flight behavior of geese.}},

Abstract = {{The geographic and specific distribution of avian Haematozoa is poorly
   understood and much basic information is still needed. Studies of blood
   parasites in avian communities are scarce despite of their potential for
   disentangling the relative importance of host-specific and ecological
   factors shaping blood parasite distributions. Here we present the first
   study of blood parasites in a breeding community of seabirds by scanning
   blood smears obtained from 560 birds belonging to 13 species breeding in
   patagonia, Argentina. Seven of these species have not been sampled
   previously for blood parasites. No blood parasites were detected. The
   scarcity of vectors due to the marine environment and the dry conditions
   around the colonies is the most plausible hypothesis for explaining the
   apparent absence of blood parasites in the Patagonian seabird community,
   although other hypotheses should be examined.}},

Abstract = {{Molting is a fundamental biological process common to all birds, and
   understanding molt strategies is an integral part of studying any
   species' life history. Molt of the monotypic Ivory Gull (Pagrophila
   eburnea) has received variable and often contradictory treatment in the
   literature. Based upon examination of 152 museum specimens, the unique
   molt strategy of this species is clarified. Juveniles molt directly into
   definite (= adult) basic plumage via a complete molt during April to
   August of their second calendar year. Adults have only a single molt per
   cycle, a strategy unique among gulls: their prebasic molt starts in
   March and April, progresses quickly, and is mostly completed before the
   pre-laying to hatching period (mid June to early August); adults
   typically suspend primary molt at this time and conclude molt of
   outermost primaries in late August or September. Thus molt and breeding
   overlap broadly in the Ivory Gull, presumably an adaptation of the
   constraints of its high-latitude winter range and the brief Arctic
   summer.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) wintering in the
   southeast delta of Arkansas were monitored via aerial surveys to
   determine their numbers and distribution. At least two surveys per month
   (December 1999-April 2000) were conducted. Each survey was comprised of
   two separate afternoon flights to cover the study area during the
   evening roosting period. Most of the two flights making up each survey
   were flown on consecutive days to reduce possible movement of cormorants
   between the two flight routes. December through February surveys all
   exceeded 15,000 individuals, except for early January, when there was an
   appreciable drop in numbers. The cormorant numbers peaked in early
   February at 26,822 individuals. During this study, cormorants utilized a
   total of ten night roosts within this catfish-producing region of
   Arkansas. This study area in southeast Arkansas encompasses the primary
   production acreage for the Arkansas catfish industry and is a likely
   attractant for the Double-crested Cormorant. This collection of baseline
   population data is important in researching the relation of the Catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus) industry to growing cormorant numbers. These data
   will also provide a valuable base line in assessing cormorant population
   changes that might occur due to any future management strategies adopted
   by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.}},

Abstract = {{In October 1999, approximately 110 King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis)
   were found on the ground in the middle of Baffin Island, indicating that
   these birds had been following an overland migration. The composition of
   the flock was mixed in both sex (44\% female, 56\% male) and age of
   birds (62\% hatch year, 38\% after hatch year). Approximately 40 birds
   flew off after resting for six days on the frozen ground. Of the
   remaining birds that died, predators ate about 15, and 55 were recovered
   by staff from a local radar site. All eider carcasses carried fat
   reserves, although there were differences in body mass related to age
   and sex. Most birds had injuries consistent with crashing into an object
   at high speed, but in the absence of any obvious vertical obstacles in
   this region, it appears that this flock flew into the ground during
   conditions of poor visibility, perhaps facilitated by the formation of
   cataracts in their eyes.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by ardeids in Starling Inlet, Hong Kong, was assessed be
   walking a fired 6 kin route, two or three times a month, during low tide
   between August 1997 and August 1998. A total of 36 surveys were made,
   with a mean count of 452 individuals per survey (S.E. +/- 128). Eight
   species of ardeids and two species of bitterns were recorded. In the
   winter, non-breeding season, the dominant species was the Great Egret
   (Casmerodius albus), while in the summer (breeding season) it was the
   Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax). Shallow coastal
   waters and mudflats were the most important habitats at low tide for
   Great and Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta), and Grey Herons (Ardea
   cinerea), while fishponds were the most important for Black-crowned
   Night Herons. A freshwater marsh was used mainly by Cattle Egrets
   (Bubulcus ibis) and Intermediate Egrets (Mesophoyx intermedia). During
   the 1998 breeding season, a comparison was made between the census and a
   flight-line methods in evaluating ardeid habitat use. Both methods gave
   similar results for habitat use by Great and Little Egrets, but the
   census method underestimated the use of mangrove habitats by
   Black-crowned Night Herons and missed the Else of wet grassland habitats
   outside the inlet by Cattle Egrets. We suggest that the census method is
   more efficient for assessing the use of particular open habitats, while
   the flight-line method is more accurate for investigating overall use of
   a landscape during the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) usually nests
   in mature coniferous trees throughout most of its range, in
   south-central Alaska Marbled Murrelet nests hate been found on the
   ground in unforested areas as frequently as they have been found in
   older-aged forests. Because ground nests are typically found
   serendipitously, the relative occurrence of ground nesting is unknown.
   Further, the importance of unforested habitat to nesting murrelets is
   unknown. Comparing murrelet dawn activity (related to breeding activity)
   in forested and unforested habitats in the Kenai Fjords National Park.
   Alaska in July, 1993, we found that the number of inland murrelet
   ``detections{''} was appreciable and significantly higher in forested
   than in unforested habitat (forested stations: x = 48.1 detections per
   station, SE +/- 7.7: unforested stations: x = 17.4, SE +/- 4.0). Visual
   observations of murrelets fling close to the ground or trees are
   indicators of nesting, and were much more frequently observed in
   forested areas. Within unforested areas, murrelet land-use may be
   related to the amount of low vegetation and shrubs, as stations with
   more vegetation had higher dawn activity. These data suggest that,
   although Marbled Murrelets nest on unforested ground in south-central
   Alaska, forested habitat is much more heavily occupied than unforested
   habitat. We propose that habitat devoid of older-aged coniferous forest
   is suboptimal due to the shortage of nest sites that are as protected
   from predators and weather as those provided by the 3-dimensional
   structure of mature trees and older-aged forests.}},

Abstract = {{Males and females of many avian species may show no plumage dimorphism,
   but often can be sexed by differences in body measurements. Sex
   determination of many Cory's Shearwaters Calonectris diamedea, was
   possible by multiplying bill length by bill depth. In this study,
   discriminant analysis of six measurements (bill length, bill depth,
   wing, tail, tarsus and mass) was performed on Cory's Shearwaters
   breeding on Linosa Island (Sicilian Channel), Italy and the efficiency
   of sex determination was compared with the univariate method. Results
   show the advantages of the discriminant functions. Bill depth is the
   best parameter (tip to 92\% correct classification), followed by mass
   (84\% correct classification); using mass is simple and causes less
   disturbance to the birds.}},

Title = {{The effect of siblings on nest site homing by Common Tern chicks: A
   benefit of kin recognition}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{175-181}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Studies of kin recognition in birds have rarely tested its adaptive
   value. We tested whether sibling recognition helps Common Tern (Sterna
   hirundo) chicks find their nests. The ability to discriminate the natal
   nest from neighboring nests is critical to survival in chicks of
   ground-nesting, colonial birds, such as the Common Tern. We temporarily
   moved 70 four-day old chicks 1 to from their nests and compared their
   ability to return home across the following treatments: siblings in
   natal nest, no chicks in nest, siblings in neighboring nest, and
   non-siblings in test chick's nest. With a sibling in the natal nest,
   test chicks returned within 20 min in 14 of 20 trials. In all other
   treatments, fewer than half of the chicks returned. When chicks did
   return, they typically did so within 5 min. Several additional factors
   may affect nest site homing, such as parental behavior, aggression by
   neighboring adults, and habitat type. To control for these factors, we
   restricted the dataset for analysis to 27 nests by excluding chicks led
   back to the nest by a parent, chicks attacked by neighboring adults, and
   nests on a rocky beach (most experiments were performed in grassy
   habitat). In the restricted dataset, seven of nine chicks with siblings
   in the nest returned. Two of five returned in the empty nest treatment,
   none of six with siblings at a neighboring nest returned, and one of
   seven with non-siblings in the nest returned. There was significant
   variation among treatments in the final distance of test chicks from
   their nests. Siblings appeared to affect nest site honing, even though
   parents usually returned quickly to the nest and were least likely to
   search for displaced chicks if siblings were home. We also tested the
   ability of singletons to return to the nest, using air identical
   protocol. Singletons returned to the nest in only two of 14 trials, in
   none of the six cases when the dataset was restricted.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{We studied kleptoparasitic behavior of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus)
   feeding on fishery waste at trawl vessels in northern Patagonia,
   Argentina, by experimentally discarding fish. Intraspecific
   kleptoparasitism by gulls of all age-classes was recorded at all hauls.
   During experimental discarding, Kelp Gulls attempted to steal fish from
   other gulls in 23.5\% of 1.915 cases. The length of fish handled
   differed between age-classes, tending to be larger in younger age
   classes. The size of fish being carried by victims of kleptoparasitic
   attempts was similar between age-classes. On the other hand. adult and
   sub-adult were more frequently attacked when they carried larger fish,
   while juveniles were victims of kleptoparasitic attempts independent of
   the size of the fish carried by them. The lengths of Successfully stolen
   fish were similar between victims of different age-classes. Adult and
   sub-adult were successfully robbed when they carried larger fish, while
   juveniles were successfully robbed irrespective of the size of the fish
   carried by them. Gulls of different age-classes were victims of
   kleptoparasitic attempts, in direct proportion to the number of fish
   handled by each age-classes. However, juveniles were successfully robbed
   more often than other age-classes, juveniles lost prey ill 83\% of
   kleptoparasitic attempts, while sub-adults and adults lost their fish in
   41\% and 42\% of cases, respectively. Although selection of juvenile
   hosts to attack could be more profitable, attack rate on young birds was
   not higher than expected, suggesting attacks at trawlers were at random.
   Feeding where there is a high density of potential victims may be
   advantageous for juveniles compared to feeding elsewhere because they
   are not selectively harassed or displaced by older, foraging gulls. If
   so, this could contribute to juvenile survival which could contribute to
   an increased population size.}},

Abstract = {{Heermann's Gulls (Lams heermanni) have been reported to nest on 19
   islands in Mexico, but during 1999-2000 they bred on only twelve. Of the
   known active colonies. one, Isla Rasa, harbors over 95\% of the breeding
   numbers. with between 300,000-400,000 adults. Three islands each support
   between 2,000 and 20,000 adults, and the rest front 4 to 2,000 adults.
   The colonies of this species have exhibited major variations through
   time, but data are inadequate to judge whether human activities or
   changes in oceanographic conditions were the cause of these variations.
   These two, along with size and distribution of nesting colonies, should
   be monitored, if the species' population dynamics are to be understood.}},

Abstract = {{We studied American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) by examining
   reproductive success and the factors affecting it at one location, and
   by examining the status and trends of breeding population numbers from
   Florida to Nova Scotia on the east coast of North America. We conducted
   our field research on Cape Lookout National Seashore, Carteret County.
   North Carolina from 1997 to 1999, and we documented larger scale
   breeding population trends by contacting state biologists and reviewing
   the literature and historical accounts. Presence of eggs and young were
   checked two to five tunes per week (by observing from a distance), and
   efforts were made to determine the reasons for loss of the nest
   contents. We monitored a total of 245 nests and found low productivity.
   At least one egg in 32 (13\%) nests hatched and one or more chicks
   fledged from 12 broods. Overall, 14 chicks successfully fledged (nine
   from North Core Banks and five from South Core Banks) during the three
   years of the study. Of the 213 clutches that did not hatch, 163 (76\%)
   failed because of predation, and 46 (22\%) because of overwash or severe
   weather. Our minimum estimate for the number of oystercatchers breeding
   along the entire Atlantic coast and the Gulf coast of Florida is 1,624
   pairs. North of Virginia, numbers appear to be stable or slowly
   increasing and the species has expanded as far north as Cape Sable
   Island in Nova Scotia. From Virginia south, breeding numbers show a
   decline in recent years. The number of oystercatchers breeding on
   barrier islands in Virginia has decreased by more than 50\% in the last
   20 years. Given their relatively small numbers and inherently low
   productivity, American Oystercatchers are at risk in rapidly changing
   coastal ecosystems.}},

   year of the study, and of which 16 pairs raised chicks that fledged.
   Mean fledging production for 34 pairs in 1996 and 1997 was 0.44
   fledglings per breeding pair per year. Thirty of the 34 pairs observed
   used the same territory, in 1996 and 1997. Of the 30 pairs that occupied
   the same territory in both years, 16 pairs failed to raise chicks in
   both nears, seven pairs fledged chicks in one year and sewn pairs
   fledged chicks in both tears. Oystercatchers showed stronger site
   fidelity to territories where chicks were fledged than territories where
   they failed to raise young.}},

Abstract = {{During the non-breeding season, many shorebirds use coastal habitats
   where tides influence their dispersion patterns and social systems. We
   spot-mapped Long-billed Curlews (Numenius americanus) at the Elk River
   estuary, California to examine variation in territory occupancy troth
   May 1999-April 2000. Curlew abundance was highest (a maximum of It;
   territorial and tip to 10 non-territorial birds) from July to September,
   after which time numbers declined progressively to 2-6 in winter. Five
   curlews were resident on >50\% of observation days (N = 133) trout
   June-April: these individuals returned to the estuary earlier and
   departed later than 11 other territorial curlews that were present
   12-37\% of occasions and mostly from July-November. Territory occupancy
   declined in association with precipitation and diurnal low tides ranging
   between -0.7 and 1.3 m. The absence of two territorial curlews coincided
   with rainy periods. The absence of curlews front five territories
   coincided with neap (low) tides; lour of these curlews held territories
   at lower intertidal elevations with gently sloping topographies, such
   that they were inundated longer than other territories. At the Elk River
   estuary. territoriality may limit the number of curlews using intertidal
   habitats, but individual variation in territory residency suggests that
   numbers, and possibly carrying capacity, changed seasonally with
   availability of food in intertidal and pasture habitats. Habitat losses,
   such as those accompanying moderate (25-50 cm) rises in sea level
   associated with global warming, may reduce the carrying capacity of
   estuaries where existing levees preclude creation of new intertidal
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Radio transmitters have potential for measuring rates and causes of

   braided rivers of the South Island, New Zealand. Twelve chicks either
   lost their transmitters or the transmitters were removed. six chicks
   survived to fledging, 26 chicks died and the outcome was unclear for the
   remaining live chicks. A minimum of 18\% of chicks that died were taken
   bt predators, but predator identity was clear in only one case. The
   transmitters did not appear to affect growth rates of radio-marked
   chicks, but three chicks died from harness entanglement. This technique
   provided only limited information about causes of mortality in Banded
   Dotterel chicks, and radio transmitters attached with elastic harnesses
   are not suitable for young chicks.}},

Abstract = {{The median density of shorebirds during their non-breeding season on the
   coast of South America was significantly greater in coastal zones with
   high primary productivity than in zones with moderate and low primary
   productivity. A world-wide review showed that sites harboring large
   numbers of wintering and migratory shorebirds corresponded significantly
   with regions of high coastal zone productivity. We suggest that the
   spacing of rich intertidal foraging habitats along the world's
   coastlines has been an important feature in the evolution of long
   distance migration by shorebirds.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{233-241}},

Abstract = {{Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) ducklings and associated females in
   the Bay of Fundy feed extensively on invertebrates found in association
   with Knotted Wrack (Ascophyllum nodosum), commonly referred to as
   rockweed. To assess whether commercial ban est of rockweed, which is
   occurring in New Brunswick, might adversely affect ducklings, I examined
   their feeding behavior in relation to rockweed availability and duckling
   age. Ducklings fed in rockweed whenever it was available. Young
   ducklings (less than 3 weeks old) spent more time dabbling for
   invertebrates in the floating rockweed canopy and less time dicing than
   did older birds. Young ducklings fed when rockweed was most available at
   the surface, whereas rockweed availability had no effect on the Feeding
   rate of older ducklings. When rockweed was unavailable, older ducklings
   dove for food, while younger birds still attempted some dabbling. These
   results suggest that if rockweed harvest lowers the canopy height and
   reduces the tune during each tidal cycle that algae floats at (lie
   surface, it might adversely affect Common Eider ducklings during the
   first weeks of life, when they are less able to dice for food.
   Consequently, in areas where ducklings feed regularly, care should be
   taken during harvesting to avoid changing the height and structure of
   the rockweed canopy. Similarly, harvesters should avoid disturbing
   foraging ducklings, because it could increase the already high predation
   risk that these birds face in their first few weeks of life.}},

Abstract = {{Because it has been suggested that waterbirds may ingest lost or

   gizzards of Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis). Tundra Swans (Cygnus
   columbianus), and Mute Swans (Cygnus olor), three species where
   individuals have been poisoned by the ingestion of lead fishing weights.
   The greatest proportion (by mass) of grit in gizzards of Sandhill Cranes
   consisted of particles with a minimum dimension of 2.36-4.75 mm. Grit
   particles in swans were much smaller, with the most prevalent (by mass)
   being 0.6-1.18 rum. The greatest dimension of the largest grit particle
   found in cranes and swans was 17.4 mm and 14.0 mm, respectively. The
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a ban on lead fishing
   weights of less than or equal to 25.4 mm in am dimension. Based on the
   size of grit particles that we found in gizzards of Sandhill Cranes,
   Mute Swans, and Tundra Swans. we believe it is unlikely that individuals
   of those species would ingest, as grit, lead fishing weights larger than
   less than or equal to 25.4 mm in any dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The Eared (Black-necked) Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) is the most
   numerous grebe species in the world. Its status is largely a consequence
   of its abundance in North America where, unique among North American
   grebes, it is able to exploit the superabundant food resources of
   hypersaline lakes in the Great Basin. This results in high survivorship
   of juveniles during the critical first months of independence and of
   adults through the extended autumn staging period, and ultimately to
   increased population size. Because the major hypersaline lakes in North
   America are of post-Pleistocene origin, the Eared Grebe's current
   preeminence has likely been achieved only in the past several thousand
   years.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-one American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) were
   captured and fitted with radiotransmitters in south Louisiana and the
   delta region of Mississippi during the winter and early spring of
   1994-1997. The pelicans were monitored to determine their daily activity
   budgets while using different habitats such as catfish ponds, crawfish
   ponds, rivers. lakes, and bayous. Pelicans foraging at catfish ponds
   spent about 4\% of their day foraging and 96\% loafing, while pelicans
   foraging in other habitats spent about 28\% of their day foraging and
   72\% loafing. Fur all individual bird, the mean number of foraging
   sessions per day was 2.5 (+/-0.53 SE) and the mean length of each
   foraging session was 66.7 min. (+/-8.08 SE). Aerial censuses were also
   conducted to determine the numbers of pelicans in the delta region of
   Mississippi. Each rear the numbers of pelicans wintering in the delta
   region of Mississippi peaked in February and March, corresponding with
   spring migration. Pelican numbers reached approximately 4,600 during
   February and March 1996. Pelicans were observed foraging in larger
   flocks for shorter periods of time on catfish ponds than in other
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of wading birds are declining throughout the Murray-Darling
   Basin in Australia, and the loss of wetland habitats to agriculture is
   the most likely cause. This study describes the foraging of egrets in
   irrigated rice fields that occur extensively in areas of former
   wetlands. Tadpoles were the main prey of Great and Intermediate Egrets
   (Ardea alba and A. intermedia), with insects important secondary prey.
   Insects were the main prey of Cattle Egrets (A. ibis). Prey capture
   rates for Great and Intermediate Egrets declined by around 40\% between
   November and January as the rice plants grew froth seediing to mature
   stages. Cattle Egret prey capture rates did not decline. The abundance
   of tadpoles and most aquatic insects in the rice fields declined
   significantly between November and February. All three egret species
   laid eggs mainly during December and had young in the nest during
   January arid February. Thus the declining profitability of rice fields
   as foraging sites coincided with the maximum demand for food by the
   birds to rear their voting. Rice fields may not be an adequate
   substitute for natural wetlands for Great and Intermediate Egrets.}},

Abstract = {{We studied seven species of waterbirds that nested on Isla Montague,

   Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla), Least Tern (Sterna antillarum),
   Gull-billed Tern (Sterna nilotica), and Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger).
   Breeding occurred along several tidal channels of the Estero del Chayo
   and on shell mounds near the lighthouse. There were low levels of
   predation, by at least one Coyote (Cams latrans), and unknown, but
   likely avian, predators. Tidal inundation was the major factor affecting
   the nesting of the birds, as it destroyed almost all nests, eggs and
   chicks on at least five occasions during one breeding season. It seems
   likely that the pattern of inundations we recorded does not happen all
   years.}},

Abstract = {{Age-assortative mating occurs frequently in birds, and may be produced
   by active selection for older and more successful mates, but also simply
   by age-related differences in breeding time, or by mate fidelity,
   without age-related selection. We describe the occurrence of
   age-assortative breeding in the Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) near Wuxi, China. Throughout the whole breeding season, 59\%
   of the breeders were adults i.e.. birds older than two years, and 41\%
   were younger birds in juvenile plumage i.e., birds in their second year.
   Most of 206 pairs were strictly assorted by age, and only 2.4\% had one
   adult and one juvenile. A part of this assortment was due to age-related
   differences in the breeding period, but even when this seasonality is
   accounted for, the observed frequency of mixed pairs is much lower than
   expected. Mate fidelity is not likely to account for the observed
   assortment. We conclude that the strict age assortment we observed in
   Black-crowned Night Herons is to be ascribed to active mate selection by
   age. Reproductive success was higher for pairs of adults than for those
   in juvenile plumage, while no difference was found for egg size, chick
   condition or asymmetry. Pairing between adults may therefore be adaptive
   because it enhances reproductive success. The high frequency of
   Black-crowned Night Herons breeding ht juvenile plumage in China (41\%)
   contrasts sharply with the situation in other parts of the species
   range, where birds ill juvenile plumage rarely breed, are even seldom
   seen near colonies. and are believed to remain in their wintering areas.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{We studied the diurnal and seasonal activity budget of Moorhens
   (Gallinula chloropus) along a river in NW Italy. Since visual
   observations are sometimes difficult, we utilized radio-tracking with
   motion-sensitive transmitters, a technique that distinguishes between
   resting and walking/foraging activities. Radio-tracking estimates of the
   home ranges provided values (mean 3-5 ha) about one order of magnitude
   higher than those reported in the literature and based on visual
   estimates. Analysis of habitat preferences showed a positive selection
   for reeds, marsh woods and stretches of water, while cultivated fields
   were avoided. The percentage of time spent in activity during the day
   was distributed differently between the colder (December to February)
   and warmer months (March and April). In winter, the birds were active
   mainly in the early morning, and resting increased progressively as the
   day proceeded. In spring, activity was distributed uniformly throughout
   the day. However, there was no overall difference between the colder and
   warmer periods in the total time spent in activity each day (about
   44\%). The lime spent in activity was not related to daily temperature.
   In the same group of birds, the fat reserves were progressively depleted
   during winter, as demonstrated by a gradual decrease of total body mass
   and fat; moreover the loss of mass was greater on colder days. The
   findings for both activity budget and mass variation suggest that the
   birds do not try to counteract fat loss; they do not increase the time
   spent feeding in the colder months nor do they increase their activity
   during days with lower temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite tracking tvas used to examine movements of the threatened
   Pink-footed Shearwater (Puffinus creatopus) from Isla Mocha, Chile,
   during the chick-rearing period in 1998. We were able to track one
   breeding bird, one bird of unknown status and one prospector. Whereas
   the first two performed foraging flights and returned to the colony
   after about a two weeks absence, the last traveled north for four weeks,
   suggesting that it had started migration towards the wintering grounds
   in the northern hemisphere. Faster travel speeds during the day than
   during the night were found for all three birds. A major foraging zone
   was located about 250-300 km north of Isla Mocha and close to the
   Chilean mainland. The preference of Pink-footed Shearwaters for waters
   close to the coast when feeding, as well as when migrating, has
   implications for the conservation of the species.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2001}},

Abstract = {{The three South American flamingos, Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus
   chilensis), Andean Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James' Flamingo
   (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), coexist in Laguna de Pozuelos Jujuy Province,
   northwestern Argentina). This lake is an important overwintering habitat
   for Andean and James' Flamingos. The Chilean Flamingo is the predominant
   species and the only one breeding on the lake. This study was conducted
   from 1992 to 1995, during a period of drought. I report changes in the
   habitat conditions and how they affect the presence and abundance of
   flamingo species. Results indicate that in years of below average
   rainfall, the number of flamingos decreased appreciably, and their
   expected seasonal pattern of abundance is affected. Chilean Flamingo
   abundance showed a positive association with the size of the lake,
   possibly related to the scarcity of deep foraging areas. Zooplankton was
   lacking, so the presence of Chilean Flamingo might not be related to it.
   Diatom density was not a limiting resource for James and Andean
   Flamingos. James' Flamingo preferred to feed near the banks, and was
   favored by the availability of shallow foraging habitats as the lake
   contracted. Flamingos recorded in Laguna de Pozuelos represent a
   fraction of their entire populations within the high-Andes wetland
   complex. In this context, Pozuelos is an important habitat for flamingos
   and one of the main breeding grounds for Chilean Flamingo at high
   altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted weekly aerial surveys of islands along the central Maine
   coast from April-June of 1993-1997 and used aerial photographs to
   determine peak nest count dates for Double-crested Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax auritus), Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus and Great
   Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus). These data also were used to
   determine the potential effect of survey timing on the ability to detect
   long-term trends in the abundance of these species. The number of
   cormorant nests in the study area peaked in mid;Tune, while Great
   Black-backed and Herring gulls peaked in late May and early June,
   respectively. Peak nesting dates generally were consistent for each
   island across years, but varied by up to a month between islands during
   a given year. A 10-year monitoring program using annual surveys
   conducted between 23 May and 23 June, or biennial surveys conducted from
   2-17 June, would have an 80\% probability of detecting annual changes of
   +/-5\% for all three species in this region.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-38}},
Abstract = {{In most seabirds, breeding success can be related to the ability to
   obtain a suitable nest-site within the colony, and this may result in
   competition for the limited number of available sites. Thus, if
   nest-sites vary in quality, individuals of the same sex are expected to
   compete for access to the highest quality nest-sites to enhance their
   own fitness. It is therefore expected that intrasexual competition would
   result in a correlation between size in the competing sex, or the size
   of a trait used as a weapon, and nest duality. Chinstrap Penguins
   (Pygoscelis antarctica) fight with other conspecifics using the bill as
   a weapon. If bill size provides an advantage for intra-specific combat,
   rye would expect stronger bills in males occupying the best nest sites.
   We studied patterns of some adult morphological traits in relation with
   nest position in a colony of Chinstrap Penguins. Bill morphology was
   related to nest position in the colony, with individuals occupying the
   central positions having the deeper bills. This relationship was found
   in both sexes. Our data suggest that competition for position within the
   colony is not an important factor involved in the sexual dimorphism
   shown by the Chinstrap Penguin.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment in the process by which young birds are added to the
   breeding population. The two most commonly used methods to estimate
   recruitment in ducks are pair/brood counts, and fall age ratios based on
   wings returned by hunters. Direct counts on the wintering al-ea to
   determine the proportion of young males to adult males (age ratios), can
   be used for species with delayed plumage maturation. This is useful for
   species that are difficult to study on the breeding grounds and are
   seldom hunted, such as Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). Such
   an approach is only valid if age classes are equally sampled. Between
   1994 and 1999, the proportion of male Harlequin Ducks that were
   immatures in thr Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Mas estimated at
   0.068. The proportions differed across years. Little difference occurred
   through the winter months until spring, when there was a significant
   increase in proportions in March. If these age ratios are accurate, then
   recruitment would not be compensating for annual adult mortality and the
   population could have been declining during the period of our study.
   However, if immature males are not distributed evenly among the
   population, then our assessment may underestimate ol overestimate
   proportions. Delayed breeding means that immature birds experience
   several additional seasons of mortality prior to breeding, and thus the
   actual recruitment I ate into the breeding population would be lower
   than tl-lat presented here.}},

   the ibises and 80\% of the prey of the herons, Nevertheless, diet
   overlap was small (similar to 30\%) due to ibises feeding mostly on Uca
   spp. and Eurythium limosum crabs, which were taken from their burrows;
   the herons fed on the arboreal and semi-arboreal Aratus Pisonii and
   Metasesarma rubripes crabs. Divergent hunting strategies of ibises
   (tactile foragers) and herons visually-oriented predators) explains the
   diet segregation when preying on an ecologically diverse crab guild, but
   it is unclear why herons prey rarely on fiddler crabs. Scarlet Ibises
   bred successfully while feeding oil estuarine organisms living in low

   foraging habitats for chick-rearing ibises during periods of low

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the only Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber colony in
   southeastern Brazil was studied during the 1996-97 breeding season. The
   ibises began to visit their colony site by mid-September. Nest building
   and egg laying took place in early November and was synchronous. making
   the fir it ``nesting pulse{''}. Mean clutch size in this pulse was 2.45
   eggs/nest, and 0.67 young/nest reached age three weeks. When they were
   able to walk about the nest tree and environs. Predation was the main
   cause of nest failures (74\% of all losses) I followed by nest collapses
   (19\%). A second nesting pulse, also synchronous, started in late
   December when the younger from the first nests were already able to
   wander about the colony and make show flights. Mean clutch size of this
   pulse was 2.05 eggs/nest and productivity was 0.34 young/nest. Nest
   collapses during storms accounted for 58\% of the losses, and predation
   for a further 27\% A third pulse, with only a few nests, started when
   the second pulse young were in their third week, but no nest was
   successful. The incubation time was 21-24 days, and the young were able
   to fly well when 40 days old, deserting the colony by age ii days.
   Nesting early in the breeding season yielded greater success. Nests were
   built close to each other (a sphere with a 1.8 m radius and centered on
   an average nest would include the four nearest neighbors) and there was
   always more than one nest per tree, Most nests were built on the upper
   third of the nest-tree and had some cover from overhanging branches.
   There was a trend for the ibises building their nests in even closer
   proximity during the second pulse, perhaps as a strategy to lessen
   individual predation risks.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the feeding ecology of Sandwich Terns (Sterna sandvicensis)
   in the presence of kleptoparasitising Blackheaded Gulls (Larus,
   ridbundus) on the isle of Griend, The Netherlands, between 1992 and
   1998. About 30\% of all of the food the patents transported to the
   colony was lost, mainly through intervention by Blackheaded Gulls. The
   gulls mainly took the larger fish, but showed no preference for the
   energetically more profitable herring. Apparently, the gulls selected
   for prey length visibility of the prey, rather than for energy content
   of the fish. The proportion of food robbed by the gulls increased with
   the age of the tern chicks and was in parallel to the increase in pre!;
   length Sandwich Tern parents brought to the colon). Kleptoparasitism
   showed a clear pattern with time of the day, tide and wind speed. During
   the first few hours of the day almost no kleptoparasitism occurred,
   while robbery was high around 09.00h and at dusk. This bimodal pattern
   in kleptoparasitism might be related to the foraging activities of the
   gulls. A tidal effect on food loss was less pronounced. although
   kleptoparasitism was significantly higher during high tide, when
   foraging activity of gulls for other foods was low and the number of
   potential pirates in the tern colony was high. Wind strength had a
   significant negative effect on the amount of. food transported to the
   colony, while kleptoparasitism increased. Therefore, wind speed severely
   affected energy intake of th; tem chicks and had strong negative effects
   on chick growth. During the first two weeks post-hatching,
   kleptoparasitism was relatively low and had only small effects on chick
   growth, even under. unfavourable weather conditions. From then on, the
   negative effects of kleptoparasitism on growth because considerable.
   Check growth was severely affected by strong winds. Sandwich Terns show
   several behavioral strategies in order to reduce the rate of food loss
   by the gulls and to minimize the effects on chick growth and survival.}},

Abstract = {{Egg size variation in the Pied Vocet Recurvirostra avosetta was studied
   at seven breeding colonies on the North Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein
   in Germany in 1999. A total of 999 eggs from 283 clutches were measured
   during the whole breeding period. Egg size was very variable and most
   variance was due to differences between clutches. Eggs within a clutch
   were relatively uniform in size. Size differences due to laying order
   could not he detected. Egg size did not differ between four-egg and
   three-egg clutches. Egg size, clutch size and the length of the
   incubation period decreased as the season progressed. Egg size and chick
   size at hatching were positively correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), which breed in North America and migrate
   in to the southern hemisphere in winter, show a wide nonbreeding
   distribution that includes the Atlantic coasts of Argentina and Brazil.
   At Punta Rasa (Samborombon Bay, Argentina), there were about 30,000
   Common Terns. Their diet in winter was assessed by the analysis of
   regurgitated pellets collected at Punta Rasa. Adult Coleoptera, Odonata,
   Orthoptera and Hemiptera were the main insects found in the diet. A
   total of 14 species of fishes were identified. Argentine Anchovy
   (Engraulis anchoita) and Anchovy (Anchoa marinii) (Family Engraulidae),
   represented 79\% by number and the 78\% of the consumed biomass of fish
   prey. The average length of fish prey was 90.0 +/- 17.6 mm. Half the
   prey lived in seawater, while the other half was taken in estuarine or
   seawater. There was no evidence of fish prey taken by terns foraging in
   freshwater habitats. Total consumption of food was estimated as 106 tons
   of fish (most of them juvenile) during a five month period at Punta
   Rasa.}},

Abstract = {{We measured waterbird richness and abundance, and characterized wetland
   features (attitude, size, and presence of submergent vegetation) of 50
   altiplano wetlands, during summer and winter 1998. We estimated 36,700
   individuals of 24 avian species during the summer census. James'
   Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamusi and Andean Flamingo (P. andinus) were
   the most abundant species, followed by Horned Coot (Fulica cornuta),
   Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), and Crested Duck (Anas
   specularioides). These species comprised 78\% of total individuals. In
   winter, we counted 7,121 individuals of 16 species, and the three
   flamingo species were the most abundant. In summer, we found Chilean and
   Andean Flamingos primarily in intermediate-altitude wetlands
   (3,500-4,000 m a.s.l.), whereas James' Flamingos and other waterbirds
   were above 4,000 m. In winter. the three flamingo species moved to
   lower-altitude wetlands (below 3,500 m).Water bird abundance was
   positively correlated with wetland size in wetlands with aquatic
   vegetation, with waterbird richness in wetlands without macrophytes.
   During summer, total abundance and richness were significantly higher in
   wetlands with macrophytes, where Chilean Flamingo and ten other
   waterbird species (e.g.. duck, grebes, gulls, and coots] were more
   common. James' Flamingo was the only species more abundant in
   hypersaline wetlands. In summer, foils wetlands (Grande, La Alumbrera:
   Vilama, and Pozuelos) contained 68\% of the total individuals, with more
   than 3,000 waterbirds each. In winter, wetlands Pozuelos and Guayatayoc
   included 50\% of waterbirds counted, with more than 5,000 birds each.
   Thirty four percent of the wetlands surveyed are within protected areas,
   but only in Laguna de los Pozuelos Natural Monument is it actually
   implemented. In 42\% of the wetlands of the detected land uses that
   could represent threats to these environments. Here we propose some
   criteria to detect and prioritize relevant sites for conservation of
   altiplano waterbirds: a) large aggregations of individuals, either
   seasonal or permanent, b) vulnerable and/or endemic species and presence
   of nesting sites, c) ecological uniqueness, d) proximity to other
   complementary wetlands, e) high heterogeneity between and within sites.
   The complementary use of these environments by waterbird, both
   seasonally and spatially, suggests considering conservation action from
   a landscape perspective.}},

   During one of these events in 1995 at Peulla, Todos los Santos Lake, a

   rodents, mainly the Rice Rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). After the

   residents of inland lakes in southern Chile, these observations suggest

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-124}},
Abstract = {{Four attempts of double-brooding (rearing two broods in one year) in the
   Red-necked Grebe (Podiceps grisegena in SE Poland were recorded out of
   163 breeding pairs studied over the period 1993-1999. Two pairs
   successfully reared two bloods during the same nesting season. Time
   appears to be an important constraint on the incidence of
   double-brooding. The pairs attempting double-brooding were among the
   earliest breeders and the second clutches were started early, relative
   to the hatching time of the previous brood, All pairs attempting a
   second brood nested on fry ponds with high fish availability.
   Double-brooded pairs fed the first-brood young more frequently before
   the onset and after termination of incubation of the secund clutch than
   did single-brooded pairs during the corresponding period of brood
   rearing. However, in comparison with single-breeders, parents attempting
   double-broods were aggressive to the first-brood young earlier and fed
   them less frequently during the incubation of the subsequent clutch.
   Apparently only early breeding on territories with abundant food allows
   grebe parents to overcome conflicting pressures resulting from
   overlapping parental investment in successive reproductive attempts.}},

Abstract = {{During the winter months Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) often form feeding
   associations with Red-breasted Mergansers (Mergus serrator) at Bolsa
   Chica Ecological Reserve, Orange County, California. We quantified and
   compared foraging success of egrets feeding in associations with success
   of egrets feeding independently. During winter 1996/1997, egrets feeding
   with mergansers increased their rate of prey acquisition by increasing
   both their striking rate (strikes/min) and their striking efficiency
   (captures/strike). In contrast, during winter 1997-98 we found no
   differences in the rate of prey acquisition between egrets feeding
   independently and those feeding in association with mergansers. Although
   ice did not quantify the size of prey taken, egrets feeding in
   associations in 1997-1998 may have captured larger prey than those that
   were feeding alone. ERrets may benefit from feeding in associations with
   mergansers by increasing their prey capture rate and/or by capturing
   larger prey.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the diet of Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) in the
   autumn and winter of 1998-99 in the Belcher Islands, Nunavut, Canada.
   Collections were made in early November before spa ice had formed and in
   February and March, the time of maximum ice cover. Eight birds collected
   in the autumn and 19 collected in the winter had food items in the
   proventriculus/esophagus. For birds collected in the fall, 89\%
   (aggregate wet mass) of the diet consisted of the amphipod Calliopius
   laeviusculus. The remainder consisted of other smaller amphipods (5\%)
   and sandlance (sandeels, Ammodytes sp.; 6\%). In winter Long-tailed Duck
   diet consisted of the amphipod Is-chyrocerus anquipes (69\%), fish eggs
   (probably sandlance; 24\%), sandlance (1\%) and other amphipods (5\%).
   Long-tailed Duck foraging at the landfast ice flee edge along coasts fed
   mostly on fish and fish eggs, while those in polynyas among islands fed
   on amphipods. Consuming soft-bodied prey with high energy densities is
   likely to allow Long-tailed Ducks to successfully winter in the
   predominately ice-covered Hudson Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Gulls breeding in enclosures tend to have slightly lower success than
   those nesting elsewhere in a colony. Yet, in several recent years,
   California Gulls (Larus californicus) nesting in enclosures at Mono
   Lake, California, produced far more young than those breeding outside.
   In each of those years, colony-wide productivity was extremely low, due
   to predation on eggs and chicks by conspecifics. Birds in enclosures
   probably fared better because the fence walls reduced trespassing.
   Because rates of intraspecific aggression and predation vary annually,
   enclosure effects should be expected to, vary between years. Conditions
   throughout a colony need to he evaluated before data from enclosures are
   used as an index of overall production.}},

   fishermen to reduce cetacean mortality in gill nets. Very little is
   known about seabird by-catch in this longline fishing. In January 1999,
   we conducted sun ey in five fishing villages in northern Peru to
   estimate seabird by-catch and 29 fishermen were interviewed. Eighty
   percent of the fishermen used frozen bait, which increases the
   probability of seabird mortality Ninety percent of fishermen confirmed
   that birds ate hooked while setting the gear. Additionally we found that
   over 40\% of hooked seabirds were albatrosses. The most common albatross
   off northern Peru is the Waved Albatross (Phoebastia irrorata) and about
   60\% of the population of the Chatham Island Albatross (Thalassarche
   eremita) winters off Peru. Both species are considered threatened due to
   their small population sizes. Seabird by-catch in the Peruvian
   small-scale longline fishery should be of conservation concern; pooled
   estimates of by-catch rates based on interviews were 1 to 2 birds/1,000
   hooks. The estimated bi-catch of albatrosses by the entire fleet is
   likely to lie between 2,370 and 5,610 birds each par, which represents
   between 5\% and 13\% of the pooled populations of the Waved and Chatham
   Island Albatrosses. Even though these numbers are extrapolations, they
   can be considered a rough indicator of the magnitude of the seabird
   by-catch by the small-scale long line fishery in Peru. Further research
   that includes onboard seabird by-catch surveys as well as a larger
   sample of interviews with fishermen are required. Public awareness that
   encourages the implementation of by-catch deterrence measures such as
   bird lines, night setting of hooks, and the use of fresh bait, will help
   reduce by-catch and bait loss, thus benefiting fishermen and promoting
   albatross conservation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the feeding ecology of Kittlitz's (Brachyramphus
   brevirostris) and Marbled (B. marmoratus) murrelets in Prince William
   Sound, Alaska, during 1996-1998 in relation to environmental
   characteristics and other attributes (e.g., time of day, season). The
   proportion of feeding Kittlitz's Murrelets was significantly affected by
   survey type season, year, habitat type, ice cover, distance from shore,
   water depth, and shoreline substrate. The proportion of feeding Marbled
   Murrelets was significantly affected by survey type, time of day, year,
   habitat type, ice cover, sea-surface temperature and salinity distance
   from freshwater input, distance from shore, water depth, and shoreline
   substrate. Both species primarily ate the common forage fishes that
   occurred in these glaciated fjords, except in early summer, when it
   appears that they forage extensively on pelagic invertebrates. Prey
   species and mean sizes of fishes eaten, occurrence in mixed-species
   feeding flocks, and dive times were similar between species. Thus, the
   two species exhibit extensive ecological overlap in feeding during
   summer.}},

Pages = {{15-23}},
Abstract = {{We subjected nesting Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) to one of four
   protocols that varied in intensity of disturbance at Horicon National
   Wildlife Refuge, Wisconsin, in 1999. We also evaluated the efficacy of
   nest enclosures for obtaining reliable estimates of reproductive success
   for this population. We found no differences in either hatching success
   or fledging success among the four treatment groups. None of the 23
   adults trapped on nests permanently deserted its clutch, although adults
   trapped before seven days of incubation generally took much longer to
   return to the vicinity of the nest site than did adults trapped during
   the latter parr of incubation. The estimated range of productivity for
   nests that hatched greater than or equal to one egg and were enclosed
   with fencing (1.56-2.25 fledglings/nest) fell within the range for nests
   not enclosed (1.30-2.45) and compares favorably to other estimates for
   this species. Although 47\% of 64 nests failed to hatch chicks, most
   failures were attributed to inclement weather and predation. Our results
   indicate that intensive study of Black Terns, which involves trapping,
   banding and repeated nest visitations, can be conducted without
   detrimental impacts on reproductive success. We provide some
   recommendations and protocols for future work with this species.}},

Pages = {{24-32}},
Abstract = {{We studied the post-nesting site use of Common Elder (Somateria
   mollissima) females in the northern Baltic. We compared the dispersal
   pattern of lone females tending young, multi-female tenders and failed
   female nesters without young. We also examined if females from the same
   colony used the same sites and if the sites of birds from neighboring
   colonies were segregated. Primary movements, the distance from the
   nesting site to the first observation site, were similar in length
   irrespective of female breeding status or colony. Secondary movements,
   the median distance moved from the first observation onwards, tended to
   be shorter among lone tenders than females without young. Female home
   ranges were similar, irrespective of breeding status or time of the
   breeding season, but were smaller in the outer study area than in the
   innermost elder colony. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were more abundant
   in the outer area, so food resources may influence home range size. Home
   range size correlated positively with the number of ducklings in broods,
   indicating that large broods need more food and also a larger feeding
   area. Females from the same colony were significantly aggregated to the
   same sites clove (< one km) to their nesting island. A long-distance
   nest exodus after hatch was absent, compulsory for rider populations
   with separate nesting and feeding sites. The sites of neighboring
   colonies were essentially spatially separated. This may be due to
   females moving to the nearest available feeding site, or it may result
   from mutual avoidance or aggression between females from different
   colonies. Our results indicate that familiarity with post-nesting
   feeding sites may be advantageous during brood-rearing. Because
   multi-female renders may originate from the same island, kin selection
   or reciprocity might affect post-hatch brood amalgamation behavior.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Pages = {{33-37}},
Abstract = {{Young American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorynchus) were marked
   with dyes (for two years) and patagial tags (for four years) just before
   they fledged from three breeding colonies in California and Nevada. This
   was done to identify movements and areas used by pelicans in an
   investigation of pesticide-related mortality of the birds in the west.
   Dyes on feathers disappeared after four months, while tags remained on
   birds for up to one year or more. Dispersal from the three colonies
   varied among colonies and years. Most dyed birds from Anaho Island moved
   into the central valley of California in 1963, but most remained in the
   Western Great Basin in the fall of 1964. In 1963 and 1964, some dyed
   juveniles from Lower Klamath Lake and Clear Lake dispersed into
   California, but others moved into the Snake River Plain and the Great
   Salt Lake. Most sightings of juveniles tagged between 1967 and 1970 were
   reported near breeding colonies and from the San Joaquin Valley, the
   Pacific Coast, Southern California, and Mexico. Results identified the
   relative use of specific wetlands by pelicans from colonies and
   suggested movements in some years were influenced by weather and habitat
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine recent trends in cormorant
   wintering populations and their economic impact in the delta region of
   Mississippi and to examine the response of these populations to
   management efforts directed at reducing their predation on channel
   catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). We monitored Double-crested Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations in the delta region of Mississippi
   through the use of midwinter ground counts and aerial surveys during the
   winters of 1995-96 through 1998-99 and surveyed the reported take of
   cormorants hv catfish farmers in the region under the recently-enacted
   Cormorant Depredation Order. This order issued by the U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service in March, 1998 allowed catfish farmers in the region to
   kill unlimited numbers of cormorants seen causing depredations at their
   farms. Despite roost dispersal programs and continued harassment of
   birds at farms, cormorant populations have significantly increased and
   based on ground counts have doubled from approximately 32,000 birds to
   more than 64,000 birds between 1995 and 1999. Mid-winter ground counts
   and aerial counts were highly correlated and the best linear prediction
   of ground counts (Y) from aerial counts (b) took the form Y = 1.55 b,
   (Y-intercept = 0). Roost dispersal programs continue to have the desired
   effect of shifting birds away from areas of highest catfish
   concentration, but these effects are temporary at best. However, without
   such programs, the impact of cormorant depredations on the catfish
   industry in 1997-98 and 1999-98 probably would have more than doubled
   compared to previous years. Catfish farmers in the delta region of
   Mississippi reported taking more cormorants under the Cormorant
   Depredation Order than previously reported under past depredation
   permits issued to individual farmers. The reported take of at least
   9,557 birds by Mississippi catfish Farmers had no apparent impacts on
   wintering populations during 1998-99, Further monitoring of cormorant
   wintering populations over more of their wintering range is recommended.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Abstract = {{Published accounts of interspecific differences in habitat use by
   waterbirds predict that shallow wetlands should accommodate more species
   and greater numbers of waterbirds than deep wetlands. We evaluated this
   hypothesis by examining relationships between winter (January/February)
   waterbird use (presence/absence, density and number of species) and
   average depth, variation in depth and size of 25 wetlands in the
   northern San joaquin Valley, California. Bird densities correlated
   consistently with depth. Likelihood of use increased in shallow wetlands
   for all nine wading birds (shorebirds and ibis); densities of three
   dabbling duck species and Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) also
   increased in shallow wetlands, whereas use and densities of two diving
   birds increased in deep wetlands. We observed no statistically
   significant relationship between depth and densities of two other
   waterbird species. The number of species of waterbird, dabbling duck,
   and wading bird increased in shallow wetlands, whereas the number of
   species of diving bird increased in deep wetlands. Wetland size and
   topographic variation inconsistently predicted waterbird densities, but
   both characteristics correlated positively with number of species. Our
   results provide general support for shallow flooding of wetlands to
   provide habitat for more species. We conclude that managers seeking to
   provide foraging habitat for a diverse community of wintering waterbirds
   should flood wetlands to average depths of 10-20 cm, where topography
   can provide a range of depths attractive to a large number of species.
   However, this prescription is region-specific and influenced by the
   great diversity and abundance of waterfowl and shorebirds wintering in
   California's Central Valley.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic hazing devices recently have been developed as a possible means
   of deterring waterbirds From oil spills, thereby reducing casualties.
   However, the effectiveness of these devices has nor been examined with
   rigorous statistical tests. We conducted a study in the San Francisco
   Bay estuary to develop a design for testing the effectiveness of an
   aquatic hazing device on waterbirds in open water. Transects marked with
   poles at 100-m intervals up to 800 m from the hazing device were
   established at two sites separated by three km in the north hay.
   Alternating two-day test and control periods were conducted at each
   site. Observers in overwater blinds counted the number, species and
   behavior (swimming, diving, or preening) of birds on transects each day.
   Aerial surveys of birds within four km of the device were conducted at
   the beginning of each test. For both aerial and around sun cys, a
   three-way mixed model analysis of variance test was used to examine
   trial, distance from die device, and treatment (device on or off) fixed
   effects, and site as a random effect on number of Greater and Lesser
   scaup (Aythya affinis and A. marila), Surf Scoter (Melanitta
   perspicillata), and all other waterbirds. We could not detect a
   significant deterrent effect of the hazing device in either aerial
   surveys of all ducks or scaup (all ducks, F-28.33 = 1.1; Scaup, F-28.230
   = 0.9, all n.s.: 3-factor ANOVA), or ground surveys for all bucks or
   scaup (all ducks, F-28.23 = 1.0; scaup, F-28.230 = 0.9, all n.s.;
   3-factor ANOVA). There was a significant trial-by-treatment interaction
   for Surf Scoters (F-49 = 5.4, P = 0.02; 3-factor ANOVA), but Surf Scoter
   numbers fluctuated greatly among trials so the effect of the device on
   this species was not clear. Birds did not alter their behavior when the
   device was active. In general, although aquatic hazing devices have
   potential to reduce waterbird mortality in oil spills, the tested device
   was not effective as a deterrent for waterfowl in experimental trials on
   the estuary.}},

Pages = {{64-73}},
Abstract = {{Foraging habitat use by Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) during the
   breeding season was studied for thr ee coastal colonies during a drought
   year and compared to habitat use during normal rainfall years.
   Information on the distribution of wetland habitat types was derived
   using U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory (NWI)
   data within a Geographic information System (GIS). Foraging locations
   were obtained by following storks fi-om their colonies in a fixed-winged
   aircraft. Differences in hydrologic condition and, the resulting prey
   availability in coastal zone freshwater wetlands greatly affected
   foraging habitat use and breeding success of the three stork colonies.
   In 1997 (dry), although the foraging range of each colony did not differ
   from wetter years, storks used estuarine foraging habitats much more
   extensively. Breeding success (fledged young/nest) in 1997 was less than
   half the success of the wetter years. Palustrine (freshwater) wetlands
   seem very important to storks breeding along the Georgia coast. During
   dry years, estuarine wetlands, by themselves, do not appear to be able
   to support the breeding population of storks in this region. Reasons why
   these productive wetlands do not provide sufficient resources for
   successful breeding are unclear, but could include limitations to only
   two foraging periods (low tides) in a 24-hr period.}},

Abstract = {{Nest site characteristics were studied in five Audouin's Gull (Larus
   audouinii) colonies breeding on small rocky islands in the Aegean Sea,
   eastern Mediterranean. Although rocks and vegetation constituted the
   habitat of Audouin's Gulls, there were many intercolony differences in
   the use of these habitat features, especially those related to
   vegetation. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFX) indicated that
   vegetation parameters effectively identified habitat variables at nests.
   Different habitat variables discriminated between nest anti random
   quadrats in three colonies. Percent rock cover around nests varied. The
   gulls nested relatively far from the available protruding rocks without
   a tendency to nest near rock crevices and, in two colonies, rock height
   had no relation with nest placement. In two of three of the colonies.
   gulls nested farther from vegetation, in lower vegetation, and in one
   colony percent vegetation cover at nests was higher than that generally
   available. Differences in vegetation types on each island partly
   accounted for such differences. Bushy plants seemed to be more important
   fur the protection of larger chicks, rather than for nest sites, whereas
   the halophyte Limonium vulgare was mostly used for egg support.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the first deployment of satellite transmitters in large
   alcids. In 1995 and 1996, we surgically implanted 51 transmitters in
   Common and Thick-billed murres (Uria aalge and U. lomvia) and Tufted
   Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) at three colonies in Alaska. These devices
   furnished more than 2,900 locations over succeeding months (eight months
   maximum transmitter life), some 30-40\% of which had calculated errors
   of <1,000 m. We considered other data to be reliable if locations were
   repetitive within a short period of time. As measures of data collection
   efficiency, we calculated location indices (number of locations per hour
   of transmission) of 0.44 during the breeding season and 0.35 overall.
   Those values compared favorably with satellite transmitters previously
   deployed on large mammals at similar latitudes. Transmitters did not
   last as long as expected because lithium batteries tended to
   self-discharge when kept at the high internal temperature of a bird.
   Most importantly, we encountered high mortality of instrumented birds,
   especially in the interval from 11-20 days after release. Our results
   suggest that radio transmission itself somehow impaired normal feeding
   behavior or otherwise compromised the birds' health. Those two problems
   (battery life and bird mortality) will need to he solved before
   implantable devices can he applied effectively to the same or similar
   species in the future.}},

Abstract = {{From July 1993 until November 1998 the authors studied the distribution,
   abundance and habitat association patterns of four grebes species,
   White-tufted Grebe (Rollandia rolland); the Silver Grebe (Podiceps
   occipitalis), the Great Grebe, (Podiceps major), and the Pied-billed
   Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), in a wetland of the Mediterranean zone of
   Chile. Possible relationships between these patterns and increased
   precipitation associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were
   also studied. The study was carried out in four wetland habitats over
   the 47 months. The results showed a positive correlation between the
   spring average abundance of these species and total rainfall in the
   previous year. Grebe populations increased in the summer of the year of
   the ENSO evens and peaked in the spring of the post-ENSO year. The
   patterns of habitat association did not change with the quantity of
   rainfall. In general, the four species were associated mostly with
   seasonal habitats, which are deep and hold abundant emergent vegetation.
   The Silver Grebe uses this kind of habitat to establish breeding
   colonies only during ENSO and post-ENSO years.}},

Abstract = {{From May 1996 to June 1998,we studied the feeding ecology of Peruvian
   (Sula variegata), Blue-footed (S. nebouxii) and Masked boobies (S.
   dactylatra) on Lobos de Tierra Island, at the northern edge of the
   Peruvian Upwelling System. During this period, changing oceanographic
   conditions affected prey availability: 1996 was cold and 1997-1998 was
   an El Nino event. The three species showed different responses to
   changes in the surrounding marine environment. Peruvian Boobies fed
   exclusively on Peruvian anchovies (Engraulis ringens) during both 1996
   and 1997 and were not present on the island in 1998. Blue-footed and
   Masked boobies fed extensively on this prey during 1996, less so in
   1997, and no anchovies were found in their diet in 1998. In 1997-1998,
   Blue-footed Boobies switched to coastal fishes other than anchovies, and
   Masked Boobies fed almost exclusively on oceanic prey species. Changes
   in regurgitate mass and mean number of prey items in regurgitates were
   also observed. Results suggest that the abundance and availability of
   fish prey species, mainly Peruvian anchovies, determines thresholds at
   which booby species change foraging strategies to avoid possible
   competition for less available resources.}},

   active nests on Isla del Carmen, 75.8\% were single or in groups of less

   tide line on top of bare rock. Distance to the nearest neighbors' nest
   varied from < one m to 50 m ((x) over bar = 12.3, 9.5 SD, n = 19).
   Egg-laying started in late March-early April at different colonies;
   hatching was completed by mid-May. Productivity at hatching was
   comparable to published estimates for the species. We found a

Abstract = {{I observed two mixed clutches between scaup (Aythya spp.) and

   Gull egg was found in a scaup nest with eight scaup eggs and in the
   second, a single scaup egg was found in the nest of a Ring-billed Gull,
   with three gull eggs. These incidents could represent parasitism,
   accidental laying, or usurpation of nests. The observations reported
   here and other unusual behavior recorded in waterfowl literature appear
   to result from similar circumstances which include: high densities of
   nesting birds on islands; a tendency for waterfowl to nest in
   association with larids: and perhaps competition for nest sites in
   proximity to colonial-nesting species.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{147-154}},
Abstract = {{Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) survival rates were
   analyzed by means of capture histories of a small population of breeding
   birds banded from 1988 to 1998 in two caves on the Tremiti Islands,
   South Italy, to test the hypothesis that El Nino has a negative effect
   on Gory's survival rates. We tested the hypothesis of a relationship
   between Cory's survival rates and the ENSO cycle, modeling the
   survival;al and recapture probabilities by means of the program SURGE.
   After allowing for temporal variation in capture probabilities, we found
   that the variation of survival rates during our study period was in
   accordance with the ENSO cycle. We found no evidence of a negative
   effect of the warm episodes (El Nino) on the survival rates of Gory's
   Shearwater; instead, a lowering of survival rates were detected in
   connection with the cold episodes (La Nina). The main effect of La Nina
   over the range of Cory's Shearwater is cooler and wetter conditions
   along the Atlantic coasts and in South Africa, where the birds winter,
   but La Nina conditions may also strengthen the Atlantic hurricane
   season. We then constrained the survival rate by the number of intense
   hurricane days, producing a second, better-fitted model. The effects of
   che greater numbers of Atlantic hurricanes and storms may be a possible
   explanation of the lowering of Cory's survival rate observed ed during
   La Nina years.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{155-164}},
Abstract = {{Many shorebirds show elaborate breeding displays that include aerial
   flights and ground displays accompanied by song. The mate attraction
   hypothesis suggests that breeding displays function to attract mates and
   maintain pair bonds, whereas the territory defense hypothesis suggests
   breeding displays function in defining and defending nesting and feeding
   territories. We tested these hypotheses in the Western Sandpiper
   (Calidris mauri) by contrasting the duration and level of male breeding
   displays among pairs that differed in their mate and site fidelity. As
   predicted by the mate attraction hypothesis, males performed the highest
   number of song sequences during pair formation, and males paired with
   their mate of a prior year sang less than males paired to new mates.
   Further, site-faithful males mated to a new but experienced mate
   displayed significantly more than remated males or males new to the
   area. This suggests a male's prior familiarity with an area and his
   neighbors does not lessen his display rate as was predicted under the
   territory defense hypothesis. Limited support for the territory defense
   hypothesis came from observations of males performing breeding displays
   with neighboring males along nest territory boundaries. This behavior
   was short-lived, however, as males abandoned nesting areas after
   pair-formation and used adjacent or disjointed feeding areas during
   egg-laying and incubation. Male aggression (i.e., aerial and ground
   chases), as opposed to breeding displays, appeared to be the principal
   means of maintaining territory boundaries. Indeed, the rate at which
   males chased other males remained fairly constant and high throughout
   the breeding season. Male chasing behavior may also serve as a paternity
   guard to protect against extra-pair copulations. Our study also found
   that a female's prior breeding experience in an area correlated with a
   reduced display rate by her mate, particularly if that mate was new to
   the area. This indicates female characteristics may not only drive nest
   initiation, as has been shown in other studies, but are important in
   determining the duration and extent of male display.}},

Abstract = {{We salvaged dead birds from high seas driftnets in the Central North
   Pacific Ocean during a study of the impact of high seas driftnet fishing
   on marine ecosystems. Digestive tract contents and stable isotopes of
   nitrogen and carbon in breast muscles of these birds were analyzed to
   assess the effect of driftnets on the trophic relationships of marine
   birds. The diets of Sooty (Puffinus griseus) and Short-tailed (P.
   tenuirostris) Shearwaters associated with high seas driftnets in the
   transitional region of the North Pacific Ocean over lap broadly. The
   principal differences between them include 1) Sooties prey more heavily
   on immature stages of invertebrates, especially the barnacle Lepas
   fascicularis than do Short-tails, 2) Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) are
   the primary fish taken by Sooties while lanternfish (Myctophidae) are
   the primary fish taken by Short-tails, and 3) Sooties lake a wider
   variety of prey than do Short-tails. During the last years of extensive
   high seas driftnet fishing (early 1990's), both shearwaters augmented
   their diets with about 15\% offal and discards from fishing vessels.
   Values for stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in breast muscle
   tissues (delta(15)N and delta(15)C) indicate the extent and timing of
   movements of Sooty Shearwaters: including arrival of migrants from the
   south Pacific (April-May), east to west movement from the eastern
   Pacific (May-June), and west to east movement from Japan
   (August-September). Fall migrant Sooties were not detected. The only
   movements of Short-tails that ive detected were a few south-bound
   migrants in September-November.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle Egrets probably established the first breeding colonies in the
   coastal area of Texas between 1954-1959. The first nests were recorded
   in Galveston Bay on the upper coast in 1959 and probable breeding birds
   were also seen on the lower coast and in southeast Texas. Between
   1959-1968, they had breeding colonies in coastal and southeast and
   northeast inland areas. From these nuclear areas, they radiated
   (1969-1975) until most of the coast and eastern area of Texas was
   colonized (1976-1999). Between 1987-1999, small scattered colonies have
   been established in west Texas. Range expansion and colonization were
   uniformly linear. Population growth was logistic with an upper asymptote
   reached about 1979. Apparently, there is an annual influx of immigrant
   breeding birds from Mexico or Central America. The limiting factor to
   population growth appears to be the availability of nest-sites within
   heronries established by native colonial herons and egrets.}},

   foraging in managed wetlands of California's San Joaquin Valley}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2000}},

Pages = {{196-203}},
Abstract = {{A common wetland management objective is to provide habitat for a
   diverse assemblage of species, which requires data on interspecific
   differences in habitat use. Consequently, we studied habitat use by ten
   waterbird taxa (four dabbling ducks and six shorebirds) foraging in
   managed, seasonal wetlands in the northern San Joaquin Valley,
   California during late winter and early spring of 1994 and 1995. A
   MANOVA analysis detected strong interspecific differences in habitat
   use, with water depth explaining 86\% of differences among taxa in a
   discriminant function analysis. ANOVA identified four groups based on
   similarities in use of water depth: 1) small shorebirds (<5 cm): 2)
   large shorebirds (5-11 cm); 3) teal (10-15 cm);and large dabbling ducks
   (>20 cm). Among these groups, variation in water depth at foraging
   locations increased with size, suggesting that water depth constrained
   foraging by shorebirds and teal more than larger waterfowl. In
   California's Central Valley, where large numbers of shorebirds and
   waterfowl winter, our findings suggest that managers can provide habitat
   for shorebirds and waterfowl by reducing the average depth to which
   habitats are flooded, especially during winter when deep-water habitat
   is abundant. Within a wetland complex or an individual wetland, this
   prescription will yield greatest diversity of water depth, and, hence,
   bird use in wetlands characterized by variable bottom topography.}},

Abstract = {{We studied breeding Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) in Prince
   William Sound, Alaska in 1998 to assess whether these birds have
   recovered from previously identified effects of the 1989 Exon Valdez oil
   spill. We collected data on nesting distribution, nesting effort and
   success, and chick development and survival. We compared among-year
   differences in distribution and abundance of breeding pairs using data
   collected by other investigators from 1989-1993 and conducted
   within-year comparisons that contrasted previously oiled and unoiled
   sites at oro scales: regional and territorial. We found no oiling
   effects for nesting effort, breeding phenology, egg volumes, chick
   growth rates, and chick survival. Only nesting success showed an
   apparent oiling effect at the regional scale. Nest predation appeal-ed
   to be the dominant force influencing nesting success in 1998, but
   regional differences in predation rates probably were unrelated to the
   oil spill. We concluded that oiling from the Exxon Valdez oil spill did
   not negatively affect breeding oystercatchers in 1998 and that this
   population largely has recovered from the effects of the spill.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding ecology of Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) in the Deep Bay
   Ramsar Site and Starling Inlet mudflats of Hong Kong was studied from
   October 1996 to October 1997. The feeding behavior of thirty birds on
   each mudflat was observed once a month and the densities of mudskippers
   (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris and Scartelaos viridis), crabs
   (Macrophthalmus sp. and Grapsidae), nereid worms (Nereidae) and other
   benthic invertebrates were estimated. Birds in Deep Bay had a higher
   feeding rate, capture success and strike rate than those in Starling
   Inlet. Birds in Deep Bay mainly fed on benthic invertebrates, while
   those ill Starling Inlet fed on gobies (Mugilogobius piapensis) and
   shrimps Exopalamon styliferus). Nereid worms were only taken by birds in
   Deep Bay, even though the densities of nereid worms, mudskippers and
   crabs in Starling Inlet were higher. Although feeding behavior differed
   between the two mudflats, the estimated energy: intake rare was similar.
   Feeding on exposed mudflats alone cannot meet the Little Egrets' daily
   energetic requirements, but this habitat provides predictable food
   resources, such as nereid worms and gobies. The differences in feeding
   behavior were mainly due to differences in prey composition and
   behavior. Factors such as the hydrological regime and degree of organic
   enrichment may influence prey availability for the birds and thus may
   indirectly contribute to the differences in behavior. We suggest that
   energy intake rate should be considered when assessing the relative
   importance of habitats for wading birds.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding activity and behavior of Grey Herons (Ardea cinerea) were
   observed in a tidal flat with reference to habitat type (eelgrass beds
   and mud flat) and tidal cycle in Notsuke Bay northern Japan, from April
   to August in 1997. The number of feeding herons fluctuated between
   spring and neap tides, as well as low and high tides, and increased from
   spring to summer, corresponding to food requirements. Herons foraged
   more efficiently in the eelgrass beds than on the mud flat, and on
   spring tides than on neap tides. Feeding behavior changed seasonally,
   corresponding to food abundance and growth condition of the eelgrasses.
   I conclude that herons dependent on the tidal flat face the risk of food
   shortages, if they have few alternative non-tidal feeding habitats.}},

Abstract = {{;We present an overview of long-term patterns of population and colony
   dynamics of four species of colonially nesting herons, in relation to
   major environmental changes that had occurred in the Camargue, southern
   France, over the last 30 years. We considered the environmental factors:
   cold, rain, water levels, salinity and rice surface ar ea,
   simultaneously within a generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We
   found no significant association between water levels, rainfall and the
   number of nests for any species over the study period. Our final model
   indicates an effect of time (year) on the total number of nests and
   colonies of Squacco Heron (Ardeola ralloides), Little Egret (Egretta
   garzetta), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) and Black-crowned Night Herons
   (Nycticorax nycticorax), as well as on the number of nests per colony
   for the last two species. The effect of surface area of rice in the
   Camargue was significant on the total number of nests of Cattle Egret
   and on the number of colonies of Little Egret and Squacco, Heron. The
   effect of salinity was significant on the number of nests per colony of
   Black-crowned Night Heron and Cattle Egret. Our results contrast with
   some previous studies in that they suggest the importance of local
   rainfall may not be as important as the influence of other local
   environmental parameters. Our results were consistent with a previously
   reported effect of prolonged freezing on the number of Cattle Egrets and
   Little Egrets, but indicated that this effect is important only during
   extreme years.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990, >5 million L. of oil was accidentally discharged into the
   Arthur Kill, a narrow waterway that separates New York City from New
   Jersey. This oil had both immediate and long-term effects on the local
   estuary. It affected reproductive success at a large wading bird colony,
   caused changes in foraging habitat quality and food availability and may
   have caused birds to change foraging locations. In 1989, the year before
   the spills, we made 51 h of observations of foraging flights by wading
   birds nesting on the Isle of Meadows, a small dredge-spoil island
   located in the Arthur Kill. In 1998, we made 40 h of flight line
   observations at this same island colony Glossy Ibises (Plegadis
   falcinellus) showed significant differences between 1982 (prespill) and
   1998 (post-spill) in flight line patterns; however, flight patterns for
   piscivorous Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Great Egrets (Casmerodius
   albus) and Black crowned Night Herons ( Nycticorax nycticorax) did not
   differ significantly between these years. In both 1998 and 1999, we made
   censuses by automobile and boat to locate major feeding sites used by
   wading birds nesting on the Isle of Meadows, and made >900 feeding
   observations of Great Egrets and Snowy Egrets. Based on these ground
   censuses and feeding observations, it appears that birds have returned
   to once-contaminated estuarine foraging locations, and feeding success
   has returned to patterns documented before the oil spills.}},

Abstract = {{Factors influencing initiation of regional and interregional movements
   by nonbreeding ducks are poorly understood, especially during winter.
   During winters 1990-1991 through 1992-1993, we radiotagged 347 female
   Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) in southwestern Louisiana and monitored
   their movements to three regions: (1) the Gulf Coast Region of Louisiana
   and Texas (outside of southwestern Louisiana), (2) the Rice Prairie
   Region of Texas, and (3) the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We found that
   adult females were 1.9 times more likely than were immatures to emigrate
   from southwestern Louisiana during winter. During winters 1980-1991 and
   1991-1992, fe males were more likely to emigrate during stormy than
   during fair weather; whereas they were more likely to emigrate during
   fair weather in 1992-1993. Females were more likely to emigrate during
   duck-hunting seasons than during nonhunting seasons, regardless of
   weather. Daily emigration probabilities did not differ in relation to
   body condition when released (body mass adjusted for body size) or to
   number of previous emigration events. Each winter, large numbers of
   females consistently moved from the Gulf Coast Region to areas with
   abundant rice (Oryza sativa) agriculture within the Mississippi Alluvial
   Valley. We conclude that destination of interregional movements hv this
   population of Northern Pintails is highly predictable, and that
   initiation of such movements is influenced by female age and long-term
   winter precipitation patterns in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.
   Furthermore, timing of these movements is predictable, based not on
   calendar date, but rather on duck-hunting seasons and, usually, the
   environmental cues to habitat availability provided by stormy weather.}},

Abstract = {{I recorded interspecific agonistic interactions (n = 578) and
   opportunities for interactions (n = 1,550) of Piping Plovers (Charadrius
   melodus) during incubation and brood-rearing periods at Lake of the
   Woods, Minnesota to determine whether interactions (chases, balanced
   agonistic encounters, fights) were potentially detrimental to Piping
   Plover reproductive success. Piping Plovers interacted with 16 species,
   but five (Common Tern {[}Sterna hirundo], Ring-billed Gull {[}Larus
   delawarensis], Spotted Sandpiper {[}Actitis macularia], Semipalmated
   Sandpiper {[}Calidris pusilla], Killdeer {[}Charadrius vaciferus])
   accounted for 88.6\% of male and 92.7\% of female interactions.
   Interaction opportunities and interactions peaked during the
   brood-rearing period. Several species (Common Tern. Franklin's Gull
   {[}L. pipixcan], Spotted Sandpiper, Semipalmated Sandpiper) posed a low
   risk of direct negative effects on reproduction, ignoring Piping Plover
   chicks when they were in close proximity. Piping Plovers responded
   intensely to three potential predators (Ring-billed Gull, American Crow
   {[}Corvus brachyrhynchos], Common Grackle {[}Quiscalus quiscula]).
   Killdeers had the highest interaction indexes and under certain
   circumstances posed a threat of physical harm to Piping Plover adults
   and chicks. This method of quantifying interactions could be used at
   other Piping Plover breeding sites to help identify problem species and
   facilitate de development of site-specific management strategies to
   reduce detrimental aggressive interactions.}},

   this condition in Chinstrap Penguins (P. antarcticus). The frequency of
   occurrence of leucism in the sample we observed was 1:114,000 in Adelie
   Penguins (P. adeliae), 1:146,000 in Chinstrap Penguins, and 1:20,000 in
   Gentoo Penguins (P. papua). The frequency of leucism in penguins of the
   Antarctic Peninsula is consistent with the frequency of recessive
   albinism observed in other bird species and suggests that leucism
   survives in part on the Antarctic Peninsula due to survival and
   successful reproduction of leucistic individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides new data on the location and size of Southern
   Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) populations at
   Staten Island, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, in view of population sizes
   previously! reported for all the subspecies. Surveys were performed
   mainly during November-December 1998 and 1999. Mean nests were
   calculated in circular plots of 100 m(2). Nest density was then
   extrapolated to the area occupied by nests, estimated from aerial
   pictures and through ground controls. Nests are distributed mainly on
   areas of tussock grass (Poa flabellata). Most of the nests were located
   in tightly-knit subcolonies. Nest density (+/-SD) was estimated at 102.5
   (+/-29.7) nests/100m(2). Two localities, Cabo San Juan and Bahia
   Franklin, together held 173,793 nests, 166,762 located in Bahia
   Franklin, extending over a radius of 3.2 km. Based on the reported
   population data for this subspecies, the global population for Southern
   Rockhopper Penguins is likely to be close to 636,000 pairs, with Staten
   Island holding 27.3\% of the world population and Bahia Franklin alone
   holding 26.2\% of the world population. The Southern Rockhopper Penguins
   of Staten Island were almost undisturbed and unknown during the 20th
   century. The population importance of Bahia Franklin for the species was
   not previously recognized, but it should now occupy a central place of
   concern for the conservation of this species.}},

Abstract = {{We used radio-telemetry; to examine survival of adult female and
   juvenile Spectacled Elders (Somateria fischeri) from 30 days after hatch
   until departure from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) during 1997-1999.
   Juvenile survival was 71.4\%; adult female survival was 85.5\%. Mink
   (Mustella vison) were the most common predator identified for both
   adults and juveniles. Detectable levels of lead were found in bones of
   74\% of juvenile carcasses recovered and 21\% had. levels indicative of
   acute exposure, Average age at departure was 59 +/- 1 days old for
   juveniles and 56 +/- 1 days after hatch for adults. Most broods (60.5\%)
   departed the YKD synchronously. Overall our data indicate that mortality
   during the latter half of brood-rearing is higher than previously
   thought. We conclude that brood rearing is a period of high mortality
   for brood-rearing females and that lead poisoning is responsible for
   reductions in juvenile survival to fledging.}},

Title = {{Disturbance, habituation, and management of waterbird colonies -
   Commentary}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{312-332}},
Abstract = {{This Commentary presents a critique of studies of effects of human
   disturbance on breeding colonial waterbirds, including a recent review
   by Carney and Sydeman (1999). It challenges the mind-set that the
   effects of disturbance are always adverse, and the resulting management
   principle that disturbance should be minimized. I argue that many
   studies do not withstand critical scientific scrutiny, and that
   published papers and reviews systematically overstate the adverse
   effects of human disturbance. I propose definitions of the terms
   ``disturbance{''}, ``habituation{''} and ``tolerance{''}, as well as
   classifications of types of disturbance and types of effect. Contrary to
   prevailing opinions, there is little scientifically acceptable evidence
   that human disturbance causes substantial harm to terns (Sterna spp.),
   gulls (Larus spp.) or herons (Ardeidae), although it is likely that
   sporadic incidents of harassment and vandalism are under-reported.
   Convincing evidence of adverse effects has been presented for several
   other species and groups of species; most well-documented cases have
   been early in the nesting cycle and/or mediated by diurnal avian
   predators. Although there are no formal studies of habituation, many or
   most colonial waterbirds can become extremely tolerant of repeated human
   disturbance. I recommend that, where appropriate, waterbird colonies
   should be managed for multiple uses (including research, education, and
   recreation) by deliberately promoting habituation. Although many field
   biologists are careful to investigate the effects of their activities
   and are successful in minimizing them, others appear insufficiently
   aware of the potential for harm, so that there is a need for more
   complete guidelines and better training.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Pages = {{337-352}},
Abstract = {{Estimates are presented for the population sizes of 53 species of
   Nearctic shorebirds occurring regularly in North America, plus four
   species that breed occasionally. Shorebird population sizes were derived
   from data obtained by a variety of methods from breeding, migration and
   wintering areas, and formal assessments of accuracy of counts or
   estimates are rarely available. Accurate estimates exist only for a few
   species that have been the subject of detailed investigation, and the
   likely accuracy of most estimates is considered poor or low. Population
   estimates range from a few tens to several millions. Overall, population
   estimates most commonly fell in the range of hundreds of thousands,
   particularly the low hundreds of thousands; estimated population sizes
   for large shorebird species currently all fall below 500,000. Population
   size was inversely related to size (mass) of the species, with a
   statistically significant negative regression between log (population
   size) and log (mass). Two outlying groups were evident on the regression
   graph: one, with populations lower than predicted, included species
   considered either to be ``at risk{''} or particularly hard to count, and
   a second, with populations higher than predicted, included two species
   that are hunted. Population estimates are an integral part of
   conservation plans being developed for shorebirds in the United States
   and Canada, and may be used to identify areas of key international and
   regional importance.}},

Title = {{Foraging behavior and habitat choice of wintering Northern Shoveler in a
   major wintering quarter in France}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{353-363}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata) was studied from
   September 1996 to March 1997 in four protected areas, one artificial and
   three nature reserves, in the Marshes of Rochefort, Western France.
   Shoveler numbers exceeded the Ramsar criterion of international
   importance (i.e., 400 individuals) during most of the winter. Birds
   concentrated first at sewage works, showing a diel pattern of foraging
   depth which could be linked to vertical migrations of crustaceans.
   Zooplankton density decreased over the winter leading the Shovelers to
   abandon the site for natural areas. The two sites which hosted most
   ducks were those where straining the water surface for zooplankton was
   the most frequent feeding behavior. At the two other sites, straining
   was gradually replaced by deeper foraging, possibly because Shovelers at
   least partially turned to benthic invertebrates. This study suggests
   that food abundance is of crucial importance for winter habitat
   selection by Shovelers, and that even the sites with abundant foods in
   autumn may not be able to sustain large concentrations of Shoveler
   through an entire winter. Our results support previous studies which
   highlighted the importance of some artificial wetlands for the
   conservation of this duck species. Management options that enhance
   zooplankton production and, in the event of invertebrate crashes, the
   creation of alternative sites at close distance appear to be highly
   valuable to wintering Northern Shoveler populations.}},

Abstract = {{We examined effects of season, time of day, tide stage, tidal
   oscillation, and sea surface temperature on Marbled Murrelet
   (Brachyramphus marmoratus) abundance and distribution at sea. We also
   evaluated whether constraining surveys to specific time periods or tide
   stages would reduce temporal variability in counts. Murrelets were
   surveyed daily from small boats and from shore in Auke Bay and Fritz
   Cove, Alaska, from May through August in 1992 and 1993. Murrelet numbers
   were high before egg-laying, declined by more than half during
   egg-laying and incubation and were highly variable during chick-rearing
   and fledging. Murrelet numbers were highest in early and late morning
   and declined throughout the day, sometimes increasing slightly in the
   evening. Peak murrelet numbers occurred on high or falling morning
   tides, especially in shallow areas where Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes
   hexapterus) were abundant. Differences between Bears in murrelet
   abundance and breeding phenology probably resulted from interannual
   differences in the pattern of seasonal warming and subsequent effects on
   production at lower trophic levels. We recommend that surveys for trends
   in abundance in Southeast Alaska be conducted. in early morning, in
   June, at high or falling tides. Power analyses indicated that surveys
   conducted in this manner would minimize the number of years required to
   detect a significant change in abundance.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored radio-marked female American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes)
   and Mallards (A. platyrhynchos) in agricultural landscapes of southern
   Quebec in 1994-1996 to characterize nesting habitat, and to compare
   nesting success and female survival rates. In early spring, when nesting
   cover is almost non-existent in agricultural fields, both species avoid
   fields for nesting. These habitats are rather used later in cases of
   renesting. Both species selected recent wood cuts and edge-transition
   habitats (abandoned farmland, hedgerows and riparian areas) as nesting
   habitat. Median nest initiation date, clutch size, and nest success
   rates did not differ between the two species. Especially high Black Duck
   nesting success (100\%) in peatlands underlines the importance of these
   habitats. When peatland nests are excluded to provide a better
   indication of what prevails in typical agricultural landscapes, nesting
   effort of female Mallards is almost twice that of Black; Ducks. Survival
   nhs of females were similar for both species, both during laying and
   post-laying periods.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding range of the Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia) covers large
   parts of six geographic regions in North America. We obtained data from
   individuals who monitor colonial waterbirds to determine current status
   and distribution of the Caspian Tern in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and
   to report regional population trends. We estimate 32,000-34,000 pairs
   nested in North America from the late 1980s to 1998. The species'
   breeding range is expanding along the Pacific coast and in central
   Canada. Over the last three decades numbers of breeding pairs have
   significantly increased in the Great Lakes, central Canada, and along
   the Gulf and Pacific coasts; the Atlantic coast is the only region where
   significant decline has occurred. On the Pacific and Calf coasts, large
   numbers of Caspians utilize artificial habitat (e.g., dredge spoil
   islands, salt dikes and levees, landfills, artificial lakes). Changes in
   food supply may be at least partly responsible for population increases
   in the Great Lakes, on the Pacific coast, and in central Canada in
   Manitoba. Other factors that may contribute to increases include
   creation of artificial habitat that Caspian Terns find attractive for
   nesting, and legislation that protects Caspian Terns and their habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We sexed adult Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) using
   DNA-based genetic techniques, behavior and morphology and compared
   results from these techniques. Genetic and morphology data were
   collected on 605 breeding kittiwakes and sex-specific behaviors were
   recorded for a sub-sample of 285 of these individuals. We compared sex
   classification based on both genetic and behavioral techniques for this
   sub-sample to assess the accuracy of the genetic technique. DNA-based
   techniques correctly sexed 97.2\% and sex-specific behaviors, 96.5\% of
   this sub-sample. We used the corrected genetic classifications from this
   sub-sample and the genetic classifications for the remaining birds,
   under the assumption they were correct, to develop predictive
   morphometric discriminant function models for all 605 birds. These
   models accurately predicted the sex of 78-96\% of individuals examined,
   depending on the sample of birds used and the characters included. The
   most accurate single measurement for determining sex was length of head
   plus bill, which correctly classified 88\% of individuals tested. When
   both members of a pair were measured, classification levels improved and
   approached the accuracy of both behavioral observations and genetic
   analyses. Morphometric techniques were only slightly less accurate than
   genetic techniques but were easier to implement in the field and less
   costly. Behavioral observations, while highly accurate, required that
   birds be easily observable during the breeding season and that birds be
   identifiable. As such, sex-specific behaviors may best be applied as a
   confirmation of sex for previously marked birds. All three techniques
   thus have the potential to be highly accurate, and the selection of one
   or more will depend on the circumstances of any particular field study.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data for the Honolulu, HT area
   showed a population which dropped following the strong 1982-1983 ENSO
   (El Nine Southern Oscillation) to 4\% of its pre-ENSO value for Great
   Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) and to 35\% for Red-footed Boobies (Sula
   sula). The time for the populations to regain their pre-ENSO values was
   over a decade. CBC data for the Farallon Islands, CA shows a less
   striking but still significant decrease in populations of Brandt's
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), Pelagic Cormorants (P.
   pelagicus), and Common Murres (Uria aalge) following the 1982-1983 ENSO.
   Both the Hawaii and Farrallon Islands data exhibit longer term
   correlations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Populations are
   suppressed during the warm phase of the PDO. CBC data for some
   California and Oregon coastal areas showed some weaker indications of an
   ENSO effect for the latter three species but little indication of a PDO
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated variation in densities of Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala
   islandica) during winter at 214 sites within oiled and unoiled study
   areas in Prince William Sound, Alaska in relation to physical habitat
   attributes, prey biomass, and history of habitat contamination by the
   1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Using general linear model analyses, we
   found that goldeneye densities were positively associated with
   occurrence of a stream within 200 m, lack of exposure to wind and waves,
   and mixed (versus rocky) substrate. We speculate that these associations
   relate to habitat profitability via selection of beneficial attributes
   and avoidance of detrimental features. We also determined that biomass
   of blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus), the primary prey was not related to
   Barrow's Goldeneye densities; we suggest that mussel standing stock
   exceeds predation demands in our study areas and, thus, does not dictate
   goldeneye distribution. After accounting for habitat effects, we
   detected no effect of history of oil contamination on Barrow's Goldeneye
   densities, suggesting that populations have recovered from the oil
   spill. Although other studies documented hydrocarbon exposure in
   Barrow's Goldeneyes through at least 1997, either the level of exposure
   did not affect populations via reductions in survival, or effects of oil
   exposure were offset by immigration.}},

Abstract = {{From 1990-1997 we observed food deliveries to Common (Sterna hit-undo)
   and Arctic (S. paradisaea) tem chicks in the Gulf of Maine; deliveries
   were observed at four Common Tern colonies from 1991-1997 and at three
   Arctic Tern colonies from 1990-1997. Dietary overlap was high. 0.812.
   Fish comprised over 96\% of the prey delivered (frequency) to Common
   Tern chicks. In contrast, Arctic Tern chicks were fed a diet consisting
   of 65\% fish and 35\% invertebrates. Although the two terns fed
   different proportions of fish, both species relied heavily on white hake
   (Urophycis tenuis), Four-bearded rockling (Enchelyopus cimbrius) and
   Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). American sand lance (Ammodytes
   americanus) was an important prey for Common Terns at one island.
   Overall, Common Terns fed their young a greater diversity of prey than
   did Arctic Terns. We found significant inter-annual and intercolony
   differences in the diversity and proportions of prey types. ``Boom and
   bust{''} years were evident for particular prey. We suspect dietary
   differences in Maine were due to colony location; however, a detailed
   study of the relationship between prey availability and abundance and
   the foraging ecology of terns in Maine is needed to elucidate these
   relationships. We believe long-term diet data sets gathered from
   multiple sites are the best way to characterize waterbird diets.}},

Pages = {{440-448}},
Abstract = {{Black Tem (Chlidonias niger) populations are threatened in several
   regions of North America and are increasingly the subject of monitoring
   and research efforts. To focus future studies on critical information
   needs, I used a population model to determine the sensitivity of
   population growth rate (r) of Black Terns to reproductive and survival
   estimates commonly measured in field studies, and developed research
   priorities based on these results and a review of the Literature.
   Sensitivity was estimated by two methods: 1) percent change in r
   resulting from a 10\% increase in a parameter's value and 2) percent
   change in r resulting from an increase in the value of a parameter by an
   increment equal to 10\% of the range of field estimates for that
   parameter. For 10\% changes in baseline rates, r ic as more sensitive to
   adult (168\% increase in r) and sub-adult survival (62\%) rate than to
   reproductive estimates (4-31\%) as expected; however, when sensitivity
   was examined relative to variation in estimates for wild populations,
   adult survival, chick survival and nest success had similar effects
   (33-38\%). Clutch size, hatchability, renesting rate, proportion of
   2-year-old terms breeding, and longevity had relatively less influence
   on r (4-10\%). Adult and chick survival rates should be high priorities
   for future study because adult rates are important for evaluating
   breeding success data and chick survival rates are needed to estimate
   productivity Sub-adult survival is important, but will be difficult to
   study in small populations. Clutch size and hatchability information
   should have lower priorities. Although sensitivity to renesting rate was
   low, the lack of information justifies a greater emphasis. For nest
   success, the research emphasis needs to change from monitoring rates to
   quantifying limiting factors.}},

Abstract = {{Many seabird nesting areas have been altered by human activities,
   including modification of habitats and introduction of animals. In the
   Humbolt Current upwelling ecosystem, starting in the mid 1970s, the
   Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldli) colony at Pajaro Nino Island,
   central Chile, has undergone major modifications, including its joining
   to the mainland by a causeway and the removal of its pine forest.
   Although detrimental effects were expected, penguins continued breeding
   and the modifications provided new nesting habitats in which
   reproductive success has been similar to that observed in natural
   habitats. Additionally, the island holds today substantial numbers of
   breeding Chilean Pelicans (Pelacanus thagus) and Kelp Gulls (Larus
   dominicanus) which have also been able to use the modified habitats.
   Although local residents and tourists sporadically use the causeway to
   reach the island, human disturbance is kept to low levels. Some
   terrestrial mammals have been able to reach the island and are
   responsible for some degree of habitat degradation and predation.
   Despite these disturbances, Pajaro Nino Island is one of the most
   important breeding sites for Humboldt Penguins, Kelp Gulls and Chilean
   Pelicans in central Chile.}},

   In 1989 the bulk of Pigeon Guillemot population arrived in the vicinity
   of the colonies on the south coast of the peninsula in late April. In
   1989 and 1990, the median dates of laying, hatching and fledging were 23
   and 20 June; 20 and 17 July; 25 and 19 August, respectively. The average
   clutch size was 1.77 +/- 0.42 eggs, with the average egg dimensions,
   61.2 +/- 2.1 mm and 41.1 +/- 1.3 mm. Replacement clutches were initiated
   on average 12.3 +/- 0.8 days after losing the first clutch. During
   incubation eggs lost on average 15.2 +/- 0.4 per cent of their initial
   mass. Chicks averaged 39.2 +/- 3.7 g at hatching and 402.4 +/- 40.9 g.
   at fledgling (87.2\% of adult mass). Chicks left their nests at the age

Abstract = {{Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger) have undergone an extended population
   decline over much of their range, including the coast of Virginia, USA,
   where the population has decreased by 80\% in the last two decades. A
   combination of starvation, flooding, predation and human disturbance has
   been cited as the cause of low reproductive success. This study tested
   the hypothesis that, at a colony on an artificial island in the James
   River, Hampton County, VA, a shortage of food was responsible for the
   chronically low success of breeding skimmers at a site protected from
   flooding, predation or human disturbance. Parents that fed more fledged
   a higher proportion of nestlings, suggesting a relationship between food
   and chick survival. Abundance of one of the two primary prey species
   underwent a regional decline during the skimmer breeding season, and
   both primary prey species began seasonal declines before most skimmer
   chicks had fledged. Both of these fish species have also undergone
   long-term declines in the region and their annual abundance has been
   closely correlated with regional skimmer numbers. Mortality of eggs nas
   low (30\%) while mortality of chicks war high (70\%), and nestling
   growth rate and size at fledging appeared to be lower at this sire than
   published data would indicate was the case at other sites, all
   consistent dth the hypothesis that starvation was occurring Finally,
   first-hatched chicks were more likely to survive than were their
   siblings, consistent with starvation as a primary cause of death.}},

Abstract = {{We determined population status and reproductive success of Piping
   Plovers ( Charadrius melodus) at Lake of the Woods, Minnesota during
   1988-2000. This is the only remaining breeding population of Piping
   Plovers in the state and is the last geographic link between the Great
   Lakes and Northern Great Plains populations. Previous studies, beginning
   in 1982, recorded populations of up to 50 birds at this location in
   1984. Since then, despite intensive management attempts to improve
   reproductive success, numbers have gradually declined to a lo rv of six
   birds in 1997. Of 88 nests monitored over 13 years, 54.6\% hatched,
   18.2\% were depredated, 13.6\% were destroyed by storm waves and 13.6\%
   were abandoned. The number of chicks fledged per breeding pair ranged
   from 0.0-2.7 ((x) over bar = 1.1) among years. Varying water levels
   either exposed broad sandy beaches or led to inundation of Piping Plover
   nests and substantial erosion of breeding habitat. Management activities
   included seasonal posting of sanctuaries, trapping of mammalian
   predators, destruction of Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) nests,
   use of elevated string gull deterrents, use of predator exclosures
   around nests, destruction of American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos)
   nests, and removal of trees and shrubs. Despite these efforts, during
   most years, fledging rates have been below those believed necessary for
   population stability.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{482-485}},
Abstract = {{In intertidal habitats, Dunlins (Calidris alpina), like other
   shorebirds, spend most of the time around high tide roosting on the
   ground. Occasionally: however, Dunlins remain airborne at high tide and
   fly over the sea rather than sitting in saltmarshes. Here I describe
   over-sea flocking in Dunlins on the German Wadden Sea cease and trp to
   analyze factors associated with this behavior. Over-sea flocking
   occurred at only one site, the Jadebusen, where it was recorded on 5 out
   of 35 occasions. Over-sea flocking was associated with the absence of
   safe (poorly or non-vegetated) roosting sites, the presence of tall
   trees close to the site and the presence of raptors, suggesting that
   over sea flocking is a reaction of Dunlins to high risks of surprise
   attacks by raptors.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulated by an ``off-season{''} breeding observation at a Brown Booby
   (Sula leucogaster) colony on Isla San Jorge, northeastern Gulf of
   California, I monitored this island from October 1997 to November 1999,
   visited some other localities during breeding and ``non-breeding{''}
   seasons, and reviewed all the available data on breeding seasons. The
   incubation season of Brown Boobies in the Gulf of California ran from
   January to May, except that the colony at San Jorge began to breed about
   3 months earlier, while ending at the same time as the other colonies.
   El Nino events caused a premature cessation of the breeding season of
   the Brown Booby colony on San Jorge and appeared to affect also other
   Gulf of California colonies.}},

Pages = {{506-510}},
Abstract = {{The Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) has been reported as
   declining along its distributional range and has recently been
   classified as vulnerable. The actual size of the Humboldt Penguin
   population is still unknown, and a complete population assessment, is
   required. Here we present a study combining both counts of molting birds
   on land and counts of birds at sea during the molting period. We
   conducted our study in me Coquimbo Region, Northern Chile, and round
   7,619 birds on land and 2,700 at sea. adding up to a total of about
   10,300 Humboldt Penguins during the molting season (February 1999).
   Since these numbers are much higher than all other recent estimates, we
   emphasize that assessment on land and at sea need to be combined to
   provide more reliable estimates.}},

   of the family Nototheniidae predominated in the diet with G.

   nybelini in 1996. Other nototheniid fish such as L. nudifrons and T.
   newnesi were also well represented in the three sampling periods. Krill
   (Euphausia superba) was largely the most important prey among the eleven
   crustacean taxa identified in the samples. A total of 1,628 squid lower

Title = {{The annual mortality rate of Black-legged Kittiwakes in NE England from
   1954 to 1998 and a recent exceptionally high mortality}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-13}},
Abstract = {{Annual mortality rates of breeding Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa
   tridactyla) have been measured from 1954 to 1998 at colonies near the
   mouth of the River Tyne in WE England, with most annual values in the
   15-30\% range. Over the period, mortality rates tended to increase
   progressively until the mid 1980s, when they briefly fell to the levers
   observed in the first ten years of the study. This was followed in 1997
   and 1998 by the highest mortality rates recorded, reaching 39\% and 58\%
   respectively. No other species were involved. These high mortality
   rates, and those in 1984-1987, appeared to be caused by toxin-producing
   algal blooms. The toxin is extremely poisonous, killing birds away from
   the colony during a single feeding trip and affected significantly more
   females than males (possibly because of different feeding areas or
   methods between the sexes). Bodies floated ashore only when on-shore
   winds occurred. Birds died in several spring and summer months during
   each of three ! ears and in the same restricted area about seven km
   off-shore and in, or close to, an area used to dump human sewage.
   Circumstantial evidence suggests that the nutrients from the sewage may
   have been responsible for larger than normal blooms of algae. As a
   result of the mortality, colonies in the immediate area, particularly at
   Marsden, have declined dramatically ( 43\% during 1992-1997 and an
   additional 50\% during 1997-1998). In 1998, over a quarter of the
   remaining occupied nests were frequented by males only.}},

Abstract = {{Published and unpublished information on the distribution and abundance
   of the Antarctic Petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) is reviewed. Currently
   35 colonies with approximately half a million breeding pairs are known.
   All but one of these known colonies are situated in East Antarctica.
   However, an estimate derived from at sea studies in three of four
   apparent centers of oceanic occurrence suggests a population as high as
   four to seven million breeding pairs (10 to 20 million individuals). In
   spite of the tentative nature of such an estimate, the difference xith
   the colony-derived figure strongly suggests the existence of large,
   currently undiscovered colonies. particularly in western Antarctica and
   Victoria Land, where a complete mismatch exists between bird
   observations at sea and known colonies. In eastern Antarctica, in
   addition to undiscovered colonies. some known ones could be considerably
   larger than currently documented.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated seasonal migration patterns of three age classes of
   California Culls (Larus californicus). Using band recovery data and
   reported sightings of patagially marked gulls, we constructed location
   maps for fledglings, one to two-year-old gulls, and breeding-age adult
   gulls during five time periods: spring migration, breeding season, early
   and late fall migration, and winter. Using repeated observations, we
   also produced a location map with directional vector plots. Gulls
   followed a triangular pattern of movements. At the conclusion of
   breeding, gulfs migrated west and northwest to the Pacific coast,
   distributing themselves mainly between San Francisco and British
   Columbia. During winter, gulls moved south along the Pacific coast and
   by spring were concentrated in southern California and northern Mexico.
   The range size was largest among fledglings which provided the
   northernmost and southernmost observations for the population. Few
   subadult gulls migrated to the breeding colony. During the breeding
   season, a substantial portion of breeding-aged adults remained on the
   Pacific coast and throughout the intermountain west but were not
   observed at other California gull colonies. While fledglings moved
   directly toward the Pacific coast at the end of the breeding season,
   many adults lingered near the colony site and at aquatic habitats south
   of the colony. We suggest that adults remain longer in the area to feed
   and to rejuvenate before attempting migration.}},

Abstract = {{The great majority of adult Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) is
   thought to stage at Great Salt Lake, Utah, Mono Lake, California, and/or
   Lake Abert, Oregon, before making a nonstop flight to South America.
   Their concentration at a few localities provides an exceptional
   opportunity for studying trends species-wide, so long as several
   important assumptions are fulfilled Observations from 1980 through 1997
   indicated that numbers of staging adults approximated 500,000-600,000 in
   the 1980s, then dropped by about half in the 1990s. Data from the
   breeding grounds in 1967-1992, including Breeding Bird Surveys, also
   indicated a general decline had been in progress, but did not indicate
   any sudden recent changes. The validity and severity of the decline is
   hard to test because correspondence between population sizes predicted
   from BBS trends and observations from staging areas is poor.
   Difficulties in gathering and interpreting data from a species that is
   easy to study raises questions about our ability to monitor and
   understand population trends in less amenable species. Whether
   population fluctuations in Wilson's Phalaropes are related to the
   availability of habitat in the main breeding range requires
   confirmation.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-53}},
Abstract = {{Because of concerns about apparent population declines and low
   productivity of Cull-billed Terns (Sterna nilotica) along the coast of
   Virginia, we investigated whether food limitations may result in
   retarded growth rates of young. Several colonies of Gull-billed Terns
   were monitored from May to July each year from 1994 to 1996 on both
   sandy barrier islands and marsh/shellpile islands in coastal Virginia.
   Nests were visited one to three times a week to monitor clutch size and
   hatching success, and enclosures were installed around selected nests to
   monitor chick growth from hatching to at least two weeks of age. When
   comparing chick growth, we found significant year, habitat and hatch
   order effects. Chicks from marsh shellpiles had higher mass and culmen
   growth rates than did those from barrier islands, and first-hatched
   chicks had significantly higher culmen growth rates than did
   second-hatched chicks. Year effects were only found for mass growth
   rates. Growth rates of Gull-billed Terms in these Virginia colonies seem
   to be low relative to those of six other North American tern species
   from other geographic areas. These findings suggest that growth rates of
   young Gull-billed Terns, as well as other reproductive parameters, need
   to be examined in detail in other coastal areas such as Texas, where the
   species is more abundant, to determine whether our growth results are
   species- or region-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Because of a long-term population decline in Gull-billed Terns (Sterna
   nilotica) nesting along the coast of Virginia, we began a three-year
   study in 1994 to monitor hatching success and survival of Gull-billed
   Tern chicks at several Virginia colony sites. Colonies were located on
   either small, storm-deposited shellpiles along marsh fringes or large,
   sand-shell overwash fans of barrier islands. Nests were monitored one to
   three times a week for hatching success, and enclosures were installed
   around selected nests to monitor chick survival from hatching to about
   two weeks Of age. Hatching success was lower in marsh colonies than
   island colonies, and was lower in 1995 than in 1994 and 1996, primarily
   because of flooding. The average brood size of nests where at least one
   chick hatched was 1.99 chicks. Survival rates of chicks to 14 days
   depended on hatch order and year but not brood size (one vs. two or
   more) or time of season. First-hatched chicks had higher survival rates
   than second-hatched and third-hatched chicks (0.661 compared to 0.442
   and 0.357, respectively). The year effect Has significant only for
   first-hatched chicks, dth lower survival in 19994 (0.50) than in 1995
   (0.765) or 1996 (0.758). Overall, productivity was low (0.53 chick per
   nest) compared to estimates for colonies in Denmark and was attributable
   to nest flooding by spring and storm-driven high tides and chick
   predation, mostly by Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus).}},

Abstract = {{Breeding performance and timing of breeding of six seabird species
   breeding in the northwest Atlantic were compared during 1992 and 1993
   when oceanographic anomalies and changes in fishing practices provided
   an opportunity to compare effects of reduced food availability at a
   multi-species level. The inshore spawning migration of capelin (Mallotus
   villosus), a major prey for five of the six species considered here, was
   delayed by one month in 1992 and 1993, and a ground fisheries moratorium
   eliminated the production of fish offal, an important alternative food
   source for Larus gulls and Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla).
   Inshore, surface-feeding piscivores, kittiwake and Herring (L.
   argentatus) and Great Black-backed (L, marinus) gulls, had lower
   breeding success than did pursuit-diving Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula
   arctica) and Common Murre (Uria aalge). Breeding performance of Leach's
   Storm-Petrel (Oreanodroma leucorhoa), an offshore, surface-feeding
   planktivore, appeared unaffected by nearshore perturbations. Hatching,
   fledging and breeding success of inshore surface-feeders were much
   reduced while those of pursuit divers were similar to precious years
   when ocean conditions were normal. Later breeding in 1993 than in 1992
   for kittiwakes and Herring Gulls resulted in more chicks of these
   species hatching after mature capelin became available, dth subsequent
   higher breeding success. Results support the hypothesis that inshore
   surface feeders are more sensitive to changes in food availability than
   are pursuit-divers and offshore surface-feeders, and demonstrate the
   importance of timing of breeding in relation to temporal changes in prey
   availability.}},

   reproductive behavior, reproductive success, and population trends of
   waterbirds. Though most studies found significant negative effects,
   taking careful measures minimized impact on some species. Guidelines for
   minimizing investigator and visitor disturbance are outlined. Little
   practical information for visitor management is available. Increasing
   pressure from the ecotourism industry to visit waterbird colonies makes
   research that develops scientifically-defensible tourism policies

Abstract = {{The winter diet of 522 Common Murres (Uria aalge) killed in fishing nets
   off Ostfold, SE Norway was studied by analysis of stomach contents.
   Temporal variations throughout the winter 1989-1990 and sex and age
   specific differences in food choice were given special attention. A
   total of 1,864 food items were found in the 477 stomachs with contents.
   Otoliths and other fish remains constituted nearly 90\% of the items,
   while 10\% were remains of polychaete worms. Clupeids, gadids and gobids
   were the most common fish groups, both numerically and by frequency of
   occurrence. Although there were no sex and age specific differences in
   the frequencies of occurrence of the main prey groups, such differences
   were evident when data were expressed numerically Immatures took more
   clupeids, gobids and polychaetes but fewer gadids than did adults. Males
   took more clupeids, gadids and polychaetes than did females: females
   took more gobids than did males. The frequency of occurrence of
   clupeids, gadids and gobids in adults and immatures showed no
   significant variation during the winter. There was, however, a
   significant seasonal variation in the numerical occurrence of gadid
   items, but not of clupeid items, in stomachs from adults and juveniles
   during the three two-month periods in the winter 1989-1990. If this diet
   was representative, the total food consumption by Common Murres in
   Skagerrak during October 1989-March 1990 was about 12,520 metric tons,
   of which clupeids constituted 5,770 tons, gadids 6,435 tons. gobids 50
   tons, and polychaetes 63 tons. The consumption of both clupeids and
   gadids totalled approximately 10\% of the total landings by commercial
   fisheries in the North Sea and Skagerrak areas.}},

Abstract = {{Early growth of Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) chicks is a strong
   predictor of chick survival and hence of productivity. Using data from a
   ten-lear study at Falkner Island, Connecticut, we developed discriminant
   functions to predict chick survival from body-masses measured during the
   first three days of life. A discriminant function using only the mass of
   the B-chick (second-hatched in each brood) on day 2 of life yielded
   Predictions of survival (83\% correct classification) almost as good as
   any other. The correct classification rates were consistent across each
   of the 10 yr of the study. The simplest discriminant function gave good
   results (84\% correct classification) in a limited test with a data set
   from another site. We derive a formula to estimate the total number of
   B-chicks raised to fledging from the number of individuals for which the
   discriminant function predicts survival. Productivity is estimated by
   assuming that almost all A-chicks (first-hatched in each brood) survive
   to fledging, and using the discriminant function and the formula to
   predict the number of B-chicks that survive, in the absence of
   predation, the resulting estimates of Roseate Tem chick survival and
   productivity are almost as good as those obtained by more intensive
   methods, but require less effort and less disturbance. This approach
   might be useful for other seabird species in which chick survival is
   determined primarily by parental performance.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of marine bird surveys conducted in Prince William Sound,
   Alaska in July 1972 were compared to surveys in July 1989, 1990, 1991,
   and 1993 and indicated that populations of several taxa of marine birds
   that prey on fish have declined in Prince William Sound, but most taxa
   that feed on other prey species, such as benthic invertebrates, have not
   declined. Red-throated Loon (Gavia stellata), Pacific Loon ( C.
   pacifica, cormorant (Phalacrocorax spp.), Surf Scoter (Melanitta
   perspicillata), Bonaparte's Gull (Larus philadelphia), terns (Sterna
   spp.), Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba), Brachyramphus murrelets
   (Brachyramphus marmoratus and B. brevirostris), Parakeet Auklet
   (Cyclorrhynchus psittacula),Tufted Puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), and
   Horned Puffin (Fratercula corniculata) populations declined by >50\%.
   Most of these are piscivores, feeding on schooling fish. Some
   non-piscivorous taxa, such as Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus), goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula and islandica), and Black
   Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), have increased in Prince William
   Sound between 1972 and 1989-1993, although a portion of the population
   was killed by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill. Declines in piscivorous
   bird populations also have been documented in the Gulf of Alaska, the
   Baring Sea, and along the California coast in the past two decades and
   have been coincidental to changes in forage fish species in the North
   Pacific Ocean. Many of the declines ap pear to be related to changes in
   forage fish abundance that occurred during a climatic regime shift in
   the north Pacific Ocean, although some taxa were also affected by the
   Exxon Valdez oil spill.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{104-110}},
Abstract = {{The diet of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was studied by
   stomach-pumping birds at five colonies (San Lorenzo, Punta Clara, Punta
   Loberia, Monte Leon and Punta. Dungeness) over the species' latitudinal
   range in Argentina. A total of 159 birds were sampled during the period
   February 1986 to December 1988. Most prey items consisted of pelagic
   school fish, although squid and shrimps were also taken. At any one
   colony, birds appeared to be principally mono- or bi-phagic and there
   were clear latitudinal differences in prey taken. Penguins in the
   northern colonies at San Lorenzo, Punta Clara and Punta Loberia consumed
   primarily anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) while birds at the two southerly
   colonies of Monte Leon and Punta Dungeness fed primarily on squid
   (Loligo spp. and Illex spp.). sprats (Sprattus fuegensis) and Hagfish
   (Myxine spp.). The strict dependence of Magellanic Penguins on
   commercially-exploited, schooling prey species makes the species
   particularly susceptible to changes in prey stocks, as has happened to
   congeners elsewhere that have suffered population crashes due to
   poorly-managed fisheries.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-119}},
Abstract = {{The retina of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) was
   studied with light and electron microscopy. Rods, double and single
   cones were observed. Rods showed a uniform density over the entire
   retina, whereas cones gradually decreased from center to periphery.
   Cone-to-rod ratio was 2.0 in the center and 1.1 at the margin of the
   retina. Rods had a targe outer segment (26.6 +/- 2.8 mu m long, and 2.1
   +/- 0.4 mu m wide). About 80\% of the cones were double. Principal
   members had a yellowish-green oil droplet and their outer segment was
   larger than that of rods (27.2 +/- 2.5 mu m, and 3.3 +/- 0.6, tapering
   to 2.2 +/- 0.3 mu m wide). The accessory member had a short outer
   segment and was devoid of an oil droplet. Single cones had either a
   transparent or orange oil droplet and a very long and thin outer
   segment. The large size of rod and principal cone outer segments might
   be correlated with increased sensitivity of the retina, perhaps as an
   adaptation to low illumination levels in deep oceanic waters. Their
   large diameter also implies that image focusing in the Magellanic
   Penguin eye would not be very sharp. However, the structure of the outer
   plexiform laver suggests that the penguin retina would be adapted to the
   extreme changes in illumination and contrast conditions encountered by
   diving penguins.}},

Abstract = {{Diving behavior and feeding sites of 22 Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis
   adeliae) foraging at small open-water leads were simultaneously measured
   by bird-borne small data-loggers and land-based radio tracking in an
   area covered with fast sea-ice. The Adelies foraged in ice cracks along
   the share in early and mid January and around icebergs in late January.
   We identified a minimum of 1.6-3.7 feeding sites per foraging trip,
   executing 3.2-6.2 dice bouts of 78-85 min. duration at feeding sites.
   Birds changed feeding sites during 9.6\% of the inter-bout intervals but
   staved within a site for 80.7\% of the intervals. Duration of inter-bout
   intervals did not differ between birds changing feeding sites and those
   staying. Surface time to dice duration ratio increased with the dive
   sequence for dive bouts before leaving feeding sites, though this effect
   was not significant for those staying. Large variation in dice depth
   occurred within dive bouts, while dive bouts, feeding sites and sea
   depth had no strong effects on dice depth, indicating that penguins
   foraged at variable depth in mid and surface waters under the ice.}},

Title = {{Attendance and effects of disturbance on coastal Common Murre colonies
   at Point Reyes, California}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{130-139}},
Abstract = {{We surveyed six Common Murre (Uria aalge) colonies in the vicinity of
   Elephant Seal Cove Beach (ESCB), Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin
   County., California from 1998 through 1997 to investigate the effects of
   disturbance on local murre populations in the wake of a small shipwreck,
   and to establish seasonal and diurnal attendance patterns of coastal
   murre populations. Following the shipwreck in 1995, one colony (Cliff
   Rock West) was abandoned, and three others (Flattop Rock, Mid Rock, and
   East Rock) experienced reduced productivity due to disturbance and
   predation by Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occentalis), Western Gulls (Larus
   occidentalis), and Common Ravens (Corvus corax). A fifth colony, Face
   Rock, farthest from the grounding site, was apparently not affected.
   Murres attended Cliff Rock West only early in 1996, and not at all in
   1997. A new colon, formed on another seastack (Northwest Rock) after
   murres left the Cliff Rock West colony in 1996. However, no eggs were
   observed at Northwest Rock in 1996 and this colony was abandoned early
   in 1997. Seasonal attendance among colonies on Flattop Rock, Mid Rock,
   and East Rock followed a similar trend in both 1996 and 1997. Murre
   attendance fluctuated widely until the onset of egg-laying in early May,
   but then stabilized and increased somewhat until July, when numbers
   began to drop at the end of the fledging period. Both air temperature
   and the upwelling index (UI) were significantly correlated with murre
   attendance in May and June during the incubation and nestling periods.
   Mean attendance increased 18-30\% at these colonies between 1996 and
   1997. Diurnal attendance in 1996 and 1997 varied both within and between
   colonies and days, yet there was a significant downward trend in numbers
   throughout the day as well as an effect of colony disruption by other
   marine species. Given that seasonal and diurnal attendance patterns of
   Flattop, East, and Mid Rocks in 1996 and 1997 appear similar, both
   between years and to other studies, we assume that these colonies
   recovered quickly following the 1995 shipwreck. However, interspecific
   interactions and predation continue to affect diurnal attendance
   patterns and productivity of these colonies.}},

   day which is only slightly more than Basal Metabolism Rate (BMR
   predicted on the basis of an interspecific allometric equation). Cost of

   Anti-predator flocking reactions also changed with time, complex
   flashing, rippling and columnar nights were more common later in the

Abstract = {{We studied distributions and abundance of seabirds in the Panama Bight
   during 1984 to 1991. Seabird densities were highest over the continental
   shelf, densities over shelf-slope and pelagic waters differed
   insignificantly. Storm-petrels predominated in slope and pelagic waters,
   and Charadriiformes predominated the continental shelf. Five of the
   seven most abundant species (from high to low: Black Tern, Chlidonias
   niger, Red-necked Phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus, Galapagos, Least, and
   Black storm-petrels, Oceanodroma tethys, O. microsoma, and O. melania,
   respectively; Brown Booby, Sula leucogaster and Brown Pelican, Pelecanus
   occidentalis) were seasonal residents. Statistical relationships between
   distributions and environmental correlates for the Least Storm-petrel,
   Red-necked Phalarope, Black Tern, and possibly the Brown Booby and Brown
   Pelican, indicated a response to variation in upwelling. Least and Black
   storm-petrels, Brown Boobies, and Brown Pelicans increased markedly
   during the strong El Nino of 1990-1991, indicating range expansions from
   areas to the north. Predominance of planktivores in the Panama Bight was
   in contrast to the predominance of piscivores among avifaunas exploiting
   adjacent waters in the, eastern tropical Pacific and Peru Current. These
   findings probable reflected differences in oceanic productivity, nest
   rite availability; dispersal, and foraging behavior of seabirds in each
   in regime. The Panama Eight avifauna exploited moderately productive
   waters and, with few available breeding sites, was mostly migratory. In
   comparison, the Peru Current supported a higher proportion of
   piscivorous residents that exploited highly productive waters with many
   nesting sites; and the western part of the eastern tropical Pacific,
   with low oceanic productivity and scattered breeding sites, supported
   primarily migratory piscivores, man) of which exploited localized
   concentrations of prey forced to the surface by aquatic predators.}},

Abstract = {{The White-faced Storm-petrel (Pelagodroma marina) breeds on several
   tropical, sub-tropical and temperate islands in both hemispheres, but
   some aspects of its breeding biology are still poorly known. The
   European subspecies hypoleuca is almost confined to a small archipelago,
   the Salvage Islands,:about 300 km south of Madeira Island, North-east
   Atlantic. Because of its very localized distribution, this subspecies is
   relatively vulnerable to extinction and its population dynamics need to
   be understood and monitored. We studied the breeding biology of the
   White-faced Storm-petrel at Selvagem Grande Island in 1996. Birds first
   arrived at the colony in mid-December, eggs were laid from mid-March to
   early June, and the last chicks fledged in mid-August. Mean incubation
   period was 53.7 days, but was highly variable due to frequent
   egg-neglect that affected at least two thirds of the clutches. Mean
   nestling period was 60.3 days. Chick growth (body mass and wing length)
   is described. Hatching success was 60.7\% (N = 89) and fledging success
   was 88.9\% (N = 54). Breeding success (53.9\%) was not low, in spite of
   frequent predation by house mice (Mus musculus), the main cause of
   nesting failures. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus) and Yellow-legged
   Gulls (Larus cachinnans), two species thought to pose threats to other
   seabirds of the region, had no measurable negative effect on breeding
   performance at our study nests. However, we had some evidence that gulls
   prey upon chicks and adult birds. Breeding success did not correlate
   with egg size. There was a highly significant seasonal decline in both
   hatching and fledging success. Using data on burrow density and
   occupancy obtained in the main colony, we estimated the breeding
   population on Selvagem Grande at around 36,000 pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Between November 1994 and May 1996, observations on the interactions
   between seabirds and trawl vessels were conducted on five Patagonian
   coastal fisheries between 41 degrees and 52 degrees S. Twenty-three
   seabird species used food made available by fishing operations. Mean
   number of species recorded per day varied between 2.5 and 6, depending
   on the fishery and was significantly lower in the Bahia Engano area. The
   highest number of species (17) was observed at the Golfo San Matias
   area. Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) and Black-browed Albatrosses
   (Diomedea melanophris) were the most important seabirds, both in
   frequency of occurrence and numbers, followed by White-chinned Petrels
   (Procellaria aequinoctialis) or South American Terns (Sterna
   hirundinacea), depending on the fishery. Kelp Gulls were present between
   91.6 and 100\% of days at all fisheries except for Bahia Grande
   (28.6\%), with numbers which varied between a few and 600 birds (means
   between 148.2-178.8 birds). Black-browed Albatrosses were present
   between 92.2 and 100\% of days at all fisheries except for Bahia Engano
   (7.3\%), with numbers that varied between one and 375 birds (means
   between 53.7-123.7 birds). Most other species were either present in
   small numbers or were rarely observed. Seabirds obtained prey during
   discarding activities or from the net. Seabird mortality as a result or
   incidental captures was very low, with only one Imperial Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax atriceps) and one Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus
   magellanicus) killed during 394 hauls on 124 trips in the five fishing
   areas. Coastal trawl fisheries appear to have a small impact on
   Patagonian seabirds in terms of incidental mortality, but might have a
   significant effect through the provision of fishing waste, especially
   for Kelp Gull and Black-browed Albatross populations.}},

Abstract = {{Between August 1996 and June 1998 I monitored the han;esr of wild birds
   in 17 rural settlements located in the surroundings of Pacaya-Samiria
   National Reserve (NE Peruvian Amazon). At least 47 species of birds were
   hunted for food in the area, 15 of which were waterbirds. Anhingas
   (Anhinga anhinga), Muscovy Ducks (Cairina moshata), Olivaccous
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax olivaceus) and Cocoi Herons (Ardea cocoi) were
   the most commonly harvested waterbirds. Censuses of non-breeding birds
   conducted during 1998 in three areas of heavy hunting pressure (close to
   villages) and three areas of low hunting pressure (inside the protected
   reserve) did not show significant differences. The collection of bird
   eggs is also common in the study area. I recorded the use of eggs of 22
   species of birds, of which the Great Egret (Casmerodius albus), Cocoi
   Heron, Boat-billed Heron (Cochlearius cochlearius) and Agami Heron
   (Agamia agami) were the most commonly harvested. Most of the
   egg-harvesting took place in two large mixed-species heronries and was
   done by people from the villages of Padre Lopez and Nueva Cajamarca. The
   number of heron eggs taken from these colonies ranged from ca. 6,200 in
   1996 to only 220 in 1998. In 1998, human disturbance during early stages
   of nesting caused the total abandonment of the colony at Padre Lopez,
   whereas egg-harvesting during the laying period probably caused the
   abandonment of the colony at Nueva Cajamarca by Agami Herons. All the
   evidence suggests that human disturbance is severely affecting heronries
   and may represent a major threat for wading birds in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The clutch size of the Common Elder (Somateria mollissima) nesting on
   Coquet Island, Northumberland, UK has been studied for 41 successive
   years, during which time there has been a progressive decline in the
   annual mean clutch size, from a peak in 1962 of 5.37 eggs per nest to
   3.43 eggs in 1996. There is evidence of a density-dependent relationship
   between clutch size and numbers of adult ducks from 1958 to 1981, but
   since 1982 the relationship has changed significantly and there has been
   a positive correlation between clutch size and numbers of adult ducks,
   In the early years of the study, the mean clutch size laid by young
   birds was lower than those laid by older birds, but this effect has been
   lost in recent years, apparently associated with the overall decline in
   clutch size. Clutch size did not change with age after the first
   breeding attempt. Comparisons of annual average clutch sizes for ten
   years' results from the Sands of Forvie, and for twelve years from The
   Netherlands, with those in the same years on Coquet Island showed no
   significant correlations. The mean clutch size in the sample of birds
   captured each year was significantly higher than that in the birds which
   left the nest early on the observer's approach. This could be an age
   effect or reflect the general body condition of the birds. I suggest the
   decline in clutch was caused by a deterioration in the food of the elder
   around Coquet Island, which in turn is possibly linked with an effect of
   sewage discharges on mussel beds. The elder appears to be a very
   suitable species for monitoring environmental conditions of inshore
   waters near its breeding sites, through systematic recording of clutch
   size and numbers of adults.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{239-252}},
Abstract = {{The Northwest Atlantic population of the Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii)
   is largely confined to a small breeding area along the northeast coast
   of the USA between 40 degrees and 42 degrees N. This population was
   listed as endangered in the USA in 1987 because it was dangerously
   concentrated into a few breeding sites (85\% on two islands in the
   1980s). The nesting population in the area from Long Island, New York to
   Cape Cod, Massachusetts has been studied intensively since 1987, in
   conjunction with a program of management of the breeding colonies. This
   paper summarizes the results of the research program and discusses the
   extent to which it has contributed to effective management. The regional
   population now numbers about 4,000 breeding pairs and has been
   increasing slowly since 1987, except between 1991 and 1992 when it
   declined by about 17\%. Noteworthy features of the demographic data
   collected since 1987 are: skewed adult sex-ratio (about 127 F to 100 M),
   high average productivity (1.0-1.2 fledglings per pair), low annual
   adult survival (0.83), and probably low survival from fledging to first
   breeding (about 0.2). This species is a specialized forager and may be
   limited within this region by the distribution of suitable feeding
   sites. When this regional population was listed as endangered in 1987,
   managers postulated that predation and displacement by gulls were
   important factors limiting numbers and productivity. Research since 1987
   has suggested that the primary effect of gulls is to limit the number of
   secure sites available, fur nesting, and that high postfledging
   mortality and skewed sex-ratios are probably more important as limiting
   factors on population size. Research activities have contributed both
   directly and indirectly to management of the regional population, but it
   has taken longer than expected to obtain needed information on
   demographic parameters, causes of mortality, and other limiting factors.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding population of Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) in the
   Bay of Fundy has remained stable over the last decade, ranging from
   8,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs. However, the number of ducklings
   surviving to fledging in the Bay of Fundy decreased from >14\% of the
   adult breeding population prior to 1991 to <10\% between 1995 and 1998.
   Although the breeding population in the Grand Manan Archipelago
   decreased over the decade, these colonies produced more ducklings that
   survived to fledgling in the Bay of Fundy between 1995 and 1998 and
   represented an important source of potential recruits (44-87\%) to the
   eider population. Higher duckling production in the Grand Manan
   Archipelago cannot be attributed to higher hatch success, but may
   reflect lower predation rates by Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus
   marinus). The number of ducklings observed during aerial surveys was not
   correlated with commercial catches of herring (Clupea harengus), an
   alternative food source for predatory gulls. Duckling survival to
   fledgling was higher for a local breeding population in the Gulf of
   Maine (12\%) than in the Bay of Fundy (6\%). The relatively large number
   of ducklings associated with a two-island archipelago within the Petit
   Manan National Wildlife Refuge accounted for a large proportion of the
   surviving ducklings and may reflect lower predation rates by Great
   Black-backed Gulls as a result of gull control measures. The current
   populations of Herring Gulls (L. argentatus) and Great Black-backed
   Gulls breeding in the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick are estimated at
   5,367 pairs (5,011-7,282: 95\% CI) and 1,771 pairs (1,685-1,868: 95\%
   CI) respectively. Assuming that the age structure of gulls in this
   region is similar to that of the expanding New England population, the
   total number of individual gulls in the Bay of Fundy probably exceeded
   56,393 (54,173-62,289: 95\% CI) in 1998.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the breeding biology of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax
   carbo sinensis) was carried out during 1993-1998 in die Po River Delta,
   a major wintering area in northeastern Italy. The first of five colonies
   was founded in 1993, and breeders increased from 69 pairs in 1994 to 285
   pairs in 1998. The period of egg-laying lasted from early March to late
   July, but 65\% of all clutches were initiated between late March and the
   end of April. The average clutch size (+/-SD) was 3.83 +/- 0.65 eggs
   (range two to six). The survival rate of entire nests, evaluated by the
   Mayfield method, was always higher during the nestling stage than during
   incubation. The majority of losses occurred during the egg stage due to
   predation by Hooded Crows (Corvus corone cornix). During the five years,
   hatching success was 72-91\% and total nest success, 67-86\%. The number
   of young Fledged per successful nest ranged between 2.3 and 2.9. The
   reproductive parameters of Great Cormorants recorded in the Po Delta lay
   at the upper range reported for NW Europe populations and are close to
   the estimated values for newly-established colonies in Italy and for
   growing colonies in the traditional breeding areas. Unlike other Italian
   colonies, the availability of breeding sites and food presently do not
   limit expansion of the breeding population in the Po Delta. If no
   control measures are undertaken, it is likely that this southern
   population will continue to grow.}},

Abstract = {{We studied patterns of dispersal and philopatry within a Black Guillemot
   (Cepphus grylle) colony, based on a 22-year capture-recapture study of
   individually-marked birds. The study colony in western Iceland was
   divided into 15 subcolonies. Out of 356 local recruits, 122 settled in
   their natal subcolony, a far higher proportion than expected from a
   random distribution. The western part of the colony attracted
   significantly more recruits than did the eastern part. Breeding
   dispersal among subcolonies only occurred in one percent of all cases in
   which a bird as captured in two successive years.
   We suggest that potential recruits select their breeding site based on
   an assessment of quality as expressed by conspecific breeding success,
   and also that philopatry occurs because this information acquisition is
   less than perfect and birds bias their search towards their natal site.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992, as part of an integrated Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)
   recovery plan, the U.S. National Park Service initiated a long-term gull
   control program to reduce nesting by Herring and Great Black-backed
   gulls (Larus argentatus and L. marinus) at Breezy Point, western Long
   Island, New York. An estimated 600 pairs of the two species nested in an
   area of about 50 acres. Gull management included discharging
   pyrotechnics to harass gulls and keep them off the nesting areas prior
   to the onset of breeding, and the physical destruction of all gull nests
   and eggs in the colony. This program was non-lethal to adult gulls. From
   1993 to 1996, we found no evidence that discharging pyrotechnics at the
   colony site prior to egg-laying reduced the daily numbers of loafing
   gulls. Gulls appeared to habituate to the pyrotechnics and to our
   activities as the day (morning to evening) and season progressed. The
   physical destruction of nests and eggs was an effective method to
   eliminate the production of fledglings and eventually, starting three
   years after gull management began, reduced the number of nesting
   attempts 60\%, from 742 total clutches in 1994 to 282 in 1998.
   Destroying full clutches was an effective (albeit slow) method to
   control and reduce nesting by Herring and Great Black-backed gulls but,
   since about 40 percent of the colony remains, nest destruction will need
   to continue for several more years if the colony is to be eliminated.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{290-296}},
Abstract = {{Although increasing numbers of Least Terns (Sterna antillarum) are
   nesting on artificial substrates such as dredged-material and roofs, it
   is not known if these colonies are successfully fledging young. Aspects
   of Least Tern nesting ecology were studied in 1996 and 1997 along
   Georgia's coast. Numbers of nests, eggs, chicks, and fledglings at
   beach, dredged-material, and roof colonies were surveyed using
   walk-through counts from late April to mid-July. Numbers of nests ranged
   from 6 to 929 and they did not differ between years or among habitat
   types. Percent hatching success ranged from 0 to 53.4\% and did not
   differ between years or among habitat types when the data were compared
   among colonies. High within-habitat type variability due to catastrophic
   colony failures masked differences in hatching success among habitat
   types. Causes of mortality included tidal flooding and human disturbance
   on beaches; extreme temperatures, predation by raccoons, dogs, cats,
   birds, and fire ants on dredged-material islands; and extreme
   temperatures, flooding, avian predation, and falling off roofs on
   buildings. More than 70\% of Least Terns in Georgia are nesting with
   similar to 30\% hatching success on flat, gravel-covered roofs. These
   roofs could provide better refugia and nesting habitat if they continued
   to be gravel-covered rather than vinyl-covered, if drains were screened,
   and if similar to 30 cm parapets were constructed around the perimeter.}},

Abstract = {{A colony of European Storm-petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus) on Benidorm
   Island was studied during 1996 breeding season. We experimentally tested
   whether ectoparasites affected growth and health of nestling
   storm-petrels. Four species of ectoparasites were found on nestlings;
   the most common were a dermanyssid mite and the flea Xenopsylla
   gratiosa. We manipulated ectoparasite loads on chicks by assigning them
   to one of three treatments: fumigated with insecticide, ectoparasite
   addition, or control. Nestlings in the fumigated group gained mass at a
   higher rate than those in the control group, and nestlings from the
   parasite addition treatment gained mass at the lowest rate. Because
   slower mass gain may delay fledging or reduce survival, ectoparasites
   may be all important selective force on European Storm-petrels.}},

   the effects of this process on colonial ardeid populations in a

   During this process Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) and Grey Heron (Ardea
   cinerea) populations have increased in the area. The Cattle Egret
   population was strongly associated with irrigated land while the Grey
   Heron population increased in the general area as a consequence of the
   recent colonization of it, but avoided local areas with extensive
   irrigated lands. Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and Black-crowned
   Night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) populations were independent of the
   changes in agricultural practices.}},

Abstract = {{Two problems were encountered when banding frigatebirds (Fregata spp.)
   and boobies (Sula spp.). These are related to 1) the age at which chicks
   are banded and 2) size differences in adults. The problems, not
   addressed in the North American Bird Banding guidelines published
   jointly by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Canadian Wildlife
   Service (USFWS, 1991), include guano buildup inside the bands of downy
   frigatebird chicks and geographical anti sexual size differences in
   adult birds of both genera. Both problems can cause deformities in the
   foot and leg of banded birds. I discuss correct procedures for banding
   these species and urge the development of longer lasting, non-corrosive,
   and easy to apply bands for long-lived birds.}},

   flocks followed either of two scenarios: 1) larids were attracted to a
   feeding location by the presence or activity of Marbled Murrelets
   (26.9\%), or 2) both larids and murrelets were present anti flock
   feeding began after the murrelets dove from the surface (50.0\%). Other
   principal participants were Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla)

Abstract = {{Pathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) caused wide-spread mortality of
   Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Canada in 1990 and
   in Canada and the USA in 1992. Presence of pathogenic NDV in
   Double-crested Cormorants is important because of the potential risk of
   spread to other wild birds and domestic poultry, and the effect on
   population dynamics of Double-crested Cormorants. The first isolation of
   NDV from a member of the Phalacrocoracidae was from European Shags (P.
   aristotelis) in Scotland in 1949. It was found in Great Cormorants (P.
   carbo) from the Volga Delta in 1974, and in Double-crested Cormorants
   from Quebec in 1975. From 1990 to 1997, pathogenic NDV was isolated from
   Double-crested Cormorants in different parts of North America in five of
   eight years. Newcastle disease may cause high mortality of juvenile
   Double-crested Cormorants; affected birds typically have wing or leg
   paralysis, loss of balance, and non-suppurative inflammation of brain
   and spinal cord. There are no reports of extensive mortality from
   Newcastle disease in wild birds cohabiting with Double-crested
   Cormorants; however, it is likely that commercial range turkeys
   contracted Newcastle disease from Double-Crested Cormorants in North
   Dakota in 1992. Newcastle disease virus isolates from Double-crested
   Cormorants from widely separated breeding sites and from different years
   have the same predicted amino acid sequence of the fusion protein
   cleavage site. This sequence includes the substitution of arginine for
   glutamine at position 110 of the fusion protein, which appears to be
   unique for NDV isolates obtained from cormorants and associated species
   since 1990.}},

   correlations were calculated to estimate reliability, and the
   applicability, of each method was assessed in relation to the goals of
   the study. Correlation coefficients were judged to be the most
   appropriate method. In the reliability sample, data on adult returns and
   successful copulations were scored reliably (r greater than or equal to
   0.7, P < 0.05); data on food solicitations showed evidence of systematic
   error, while all the other variables were affected by random error. As
   the hours subjected to reliability assessment represented only 7\% of
   the time spent in observation, seasonal plots were made for each
   variable and the observers compared. In this case, most variables showed
   evidence of systematic error and only data on copulation attempts
   displayed a high and significant r value and no systematic error. The
   implications of these results for the courtship feeding study varied
   depending upon the type of error and the questions to be answered.
   Extensive training for inexperienced observers, fewer nests, a larger
   reliability sample and wiser choice of variables to record would improve
   inter-observer reliability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first comprehensive surveys of Fea's Petrel
   (Pterodroma feae), Bulwer's Petrel (Bulweria bulwerii), Manx Shearwater
   (Puffinus puffinus), Little Shearwater (Puffinus assimilis baroli) and
   two temporally-segregated forms of Band-rumped Storm-petrel (Oceanodroma
   castro) in the whole Azores archipelago, conducted from 1996 to 1998.
   Listening to nocturnal vocalizations was the main sun ey method.
   Breeding of Fea's Petrel was not confirmed and new sites of Bulwer's
   Petrel were not found (previous status: one site, 50 pairs), but
   previously undocumented colonies were identified for the remaining
   species. Manx Shearwater occurred in four colonies with 115-235 pairs
   (previous status: probable breeder),Little Shearwater occurred in 28
   colonies with 840-1,530 pairs (previously: four locations, >150 pairs),
   hot-season Band-rumped Storm-petrels occurred in 5 colonies with 250-300
   pairs (previously: two locations, 200 pairs) and cool-season Band-rumped
   Storm-petrels were found in eight locations with 665-740 pairs
   (previously: three locations, 600 pairs). Most colonies were confined to
   precipitous cliffs and islets, which may be a result of predation
   threats by introduced mammals. Although these surveys provided a
   valuable revision of the status and distribution for these species of
   conservation concern, further survey work is warranted and target areas
   are indicated. We discuss the potential and limitations of listening for
   nocturnal vocalizations as a method to sun ev and monitor shearwater and
   petrel populations in inaccessible habitats.}},

Abstract = {{We studied nest habitat selection and hatching success of Eurasian
   Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) breeding inside and outside
   colonies of Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus cachinnans) on barrier and dredge
   islands of the Po Delta, Italy. Oystercatchers nested on most of the
   islands, independently of habitat, distance from mainland and occurrence
   of gulls. Percentage of eggs hatched was significantly lower in clutches
   inside gull colonies than outside. Gulls were the main predators of
   eggs, accounting for 42-64\% of egg loss; late oystercatcher breeders
   were more affected than were early breeders. Nevertheless, gulls and
   oystercatchers were significantly associated, and numbers of breeding
   pairs of the two species were positively correlated on the islands. This
   appears due to similar habitat requirements, since other possible
   explanations seem unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{We measured eggshell thickness in seven species of seabirds breeding at
   Southeast Farallon island (SEFI) and Ano Nuevo Island, off the central
   California coast, in 1993. Eggshell measurements of the Common Murre
   (Uria aalge) from 1993 were significantly thicker than those of
   eggshells from SEFI measured in the early 1970s (by 10.9\%), but thinner
   than those of eggshells from SEFI measured before 1947 (by 3.2\%). In
   five species, eggshell thickness measurements at SEFI in 1993 were
   thinner than those of eggs from Oregon collected in 1979 (by 0.3 to
   5.8\%). In four species, Brandt's Cormorant (Phalacrocorax
   penicillatus), Common Murre, Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba) and
   Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata),we measured levels of six
   chlorinated hydrocarbons in the eggs and related them to eggshell
   thickness. After adjusting for the effects of other compounds, all six
   compounds had negative correlations with eggshell thickness when species
   were pooled, although only for oxychlordane was the correlation
   significant. Oxychlordane also had significant negative effects on
   eggshell thickness in Common Murre and Rhinoceros Auklet, after
   adjusting for the effects of other compounds, although the small levels
   of this and the other compounds in the seabird eggs may negate the
   biological meaning of these results. No other compounds (including DDE
   and PCB) had significant negative correlations. Hatching success of six
   species at SEFI showed no significant changes during the period
   1971-1994. Based on these results wt conclude that organochlorine
   contamination and eggshell thinning do not currently pose a problem for
   seabirds off the central California coast.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 200 years, the breeding range of the Northern Fulmar
   (Fulmarus glacialis) has expanded dramatically in the eastern North
   Atlantic. In contrast, the establishment of breeding colonies of
   Northern Fulmars in the western North Atlantic has been a relatively
   recent occurrence, limited largely to southwest Greenland and Atlantic
   Canada. Northern Fulmars prospected at a number of locations in Atlantic
   Canada during the 1950s and 1960s, and breeding was confirmed at four
   locations in the region in the 1970s. However, no comprehensive estimate
   of breeding numbers has been undertaken in Atlantic Canada since these
   initial records were made. This paper documents new breeding and
   prospecting locations of Northern Fulmars at Gun and Ship islands and
   Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland, Corossol Island, Quebec, and at Columbier
   and St. Pierre islands in St. Pierre et Miquelon. Estimates of the
   breeding populations at these and previously blown breeding locations at
   Outer Gannet and the Gannet Islands, Labrador, and at Funk, Baccalieu
   and Great islands, Newfoundland, are presented and integrated in an
   Atlantic Canadian synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{We studied food resource use br two similar seabird species, Common
   (Uria aalge) and Thick-billed murres (U. lomvia),breeding sympatrically
   at the Gannet Islands, Labrador, to examine the overlap in their chicks'
   diet and thus to indirectly evaluate whether the two species were in
   competition for food. We used Monte Carlo randomization to establish
   whether murre chick diet overlap in 1996 and 1997 were greater than
   would be expected by chance. Diet overlap was higher than 75\% in both
   years and was not lower than that predicted by the null model. To
   determine whether the two murre species' chick food resource use
   converged in ways other than diet composition, we compared timing of
   breeding, sizes of fish delivered to chicks, maximum dive depths and
   diurnal feeding patterns. In both years, the murres' chick-rearing
   periods overlapped almost exactly. The size of the principal item in
   their chicks' diets did not differ significantly. During one of two
   all-day feeding watches in 1997, the murres chick-feeding peaks were
   concurrent, but during the other they were not. In 1997, foraging Common
   and Thick-billed murres dove to similar maximum depths. Taken together,
   these results suggest that chick food resource partitioning might have
   been negligible between Common and Thick-billed murres breeding at the
   Gannet Islands in 1996 and 1997.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of nocturnal disturbance of predators on body
   condition of adult Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) we present data on body
   mass, mass change from evening to morning as well as data on flight
   activities and reproduction during nocturnal predation by a Long-eared
   Owl (Asio otus) and compare the periods before, during, and after
   predation. Birds were individually marked with transponders, allowing
   continuous recording of activity on resting sites and body mass.
   Predation caused prolonged incubation periods and lowered hatching and
   breeding success. Terns showed high flight activities during evenings
   ({''}panic flights{''}) and adults left the colony one hour after
   sunset, performing flights through the entire night and returned to
   resting sites in the morning at the time when normal flight activity
   started in the periods without predation. In 24\% of the nests, mostly
   outside of the predation center, the incubation period was not
   prolonged, indicating a return of these adults in the night to their
   nests. During the predation period, body masses were not reduced and
   mass loss during night (difference in mass between evening and morning)
   did not differ compared to non-predation periods. The only difference
   between periods was the lack of correlation between evening mass and
   mass change during the night and a positive correlation between morning
   mass and mass change during night in the period when owl predation
   occurred. Terns appeared to forage very early in the morning before
   returning to the colony site, compensating for increased energy
   expenditure after extensive flight activity. Adults chose to leave the
   colony site to escape predation and to forage before returning, a
   strategy that appeared to favor self-survival over survival of
   offspring.}},

Title = {{Long-term movement patterns for seven species of wading birds}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{411-416}},
Abstract = {{We obtained banding and recovery records from 1914 through 1994 for
   seven species of wading birds from the Bird Banding Laboratory, United
   States Geological Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. We analyzed
   these data to evaluate differences in dispersal distance and frequency
   of dispersal movement among species. All records were from birds banded
   as juveniles and recovered at least five months later between March and
   July, which is the breeding season in most regions of North America.
   Focusing on recoveries during the breeding season reduced the chance
   that movements were related to migration rather than dispersal. When an
   individual was banded and recovered in the same ten-minute block of
   latitude and longitude, a movement distance of zero km was recorded. The
   frequency of zero-distance records provides an indication of breeding
   site fidelity for each species at a spatial resolution of ten minutes.
   Our results showed that mean dispersal distance was greatest for the
   Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea; 1148 km) followed by Glossy Ibis
   (Plegadis falcinellus; 1142 km), Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor;
   1019 km), Great Egret (Casmerodius albus; 909 km), Snowy Egret (Egretta
   thula; 837 km), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias; 758 km), and White
   Ibis (Eudocimus albus; 545 km). Species which dispersed large distances
   also exhibited fewer zero-distance records, indicating greater movement
   frequency. The White Ibis has been classified as a nomad, at one end of
   a continuum defined by low breeding site-fidelity and several life
   history traits associated with unpredictable foraging habitat. We found
   that White Ibises were indeed recovered at new locations the majority
   (76\%) of the time but that the other six species of wading birds we
   examined were even more likely to move to different sites during
   subsequent breeding seasons. Movement distance and site fidelity will
   both likely affect whether a response to habitat restoration is due to
   immigration or local reproduction. Although an increase in total birds
   using a restored habitat may be an indication of increased habitat
   quality, caution should be used in inferring population changes without
   understanding reproduction, mortality, and movement of individuals using
   restored habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of nesting site availability on colony size were
   investigated in a Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) colony on dead
   trees in north-East Italy. Trees have collapsed and colony structure has
   changed in recent years. After a steady increase in size, the breeding
   colony decreased dramatically as predicted by estimates of potential
   nesting space. After the formation of a new sub-colony in living trees,
   the colony grew again. Tree structures were used differentially, with
   low-quality sites occupied in years of strong space limitation. However,
   the proportion of nest sites that were used twice in a season increased
   only slightly as nesting space diminished, perhaps reflecting the high
   costs of breeding late. The mean brood size at fledging remained
   unchanged between the growing and declining phases, suggesting that food
   availability to cormorants did not change, despite the apparent de
   crease in fish harvest size. In addition, immature-plumaged cormorants
   still attempted to breed when the mean nest-site quality was at its
   lowest. This study provided an example of a breeding colony where yearly
   changes in size were not a good indicator of its actual phase of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the foraging flights of nesting Great Egrets
   (Casmerodius albus), Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta), Black-crowned
   Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis)
   in 1997 and 1998 from the A Chau Egretry in Starling Inlet, Hong Kong,
   China, showed that shallow coastal waters were the major feeding habitat
   of Great and Little egrets, whose habitat use greatly overlapped.
   Black-crowned Night Herons, the dominant breeders in the colony,
   preferred mangroves and fishponds, while Cattle Egrets made most use of
   freshwater marsh and abandoned paddy fields. Cattle Egrets showed the
   highest use of feeding habitats outside the Inlet. In both years, Cattle
   Egrets made the longest median flights at both high and low tides.
   Black-crowned Night Herons made the shortest flights at high tide in
   both years while Great Egrets and Black-crowned Night Herons flew the
   shortest distance at low tide in 1997 and 1998, respectively. In both
   years, Great and Little egrets flew farther at high tide, when nearby
   shallow waters were too deep for feeding. Foraging flight distances
   varied significantly between years only for Cattle Egrets. More
   Black-crowned Night Herons and Cattle Egrets were involved in group
   flights. The feeding habitats in Starling inlet supported far more
   breeding ardeids than expected for their area, probably because of their
   high productivity. The short foraging flight distances of Black-crowned
   Night Herons may reduce foraging costs and help explain the dominance of
   this species in the colony. Conservation of all wetland feeding habitats
   in Starling Inlet will be necessary to maintain the present size and
   diversity of nesting ardeid populations.}},

Abstract = {{Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are sensitive indicators of change
   in Antarctic marine and terrestrial habitats, and have been intensively
   monitored as part of international efforts to understand the role of
   apex predators in the Southern Oceans. Among the key variables annually
   assessed by these monitoring programs are measures of population change
   which are typically obtained with ground and aerial censuses. Aerial
   censuses, how ever, are expensive and logistically complex, while the
   accuracy of ground censuses tends to decrease as colony size increases,
   especially in complex landscapes where high relief may block sections of
   the colony from the observer's view. Here we describe the use of kites
   equipped with remote-controlled cameras to census Adelie Penguin
   colonies at Palmer Station, a research site in the western Antarctic
   Peninsula region. We suggest that this method, which produced excellent
   results, may bridge an important gap between ground and aerial censuses,
   offering the opportunity to obtain better data for large or difficult to
   census colonies at a fraction of the cost of aerial surveys.}},

   data indicate that adult Humboldt Penguins may visit other breeding
   colonies and corroborate previously published data that Humboldt
   Penguins may travel long distances from their breeding colony Our data
   also indicate that accidental drowning in fishing nets is a cause of

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{445-451}},
Abstract = {{This study compared the diurnal and nocturnal behavior of Ring-billed
   Gulls (Larus delawarensis) at and away from the colony, throughout the
   reproductive cycle. The study was conducted during 1991 and 1992, at a
   Ring-billed Gull colony on l'Ile de la Couvee, in the St. Lawrence
   Seaway, south of Montreal, Quebec. Observations were made between 2200
   and 0100 h EST and between 0700 and 1100h EST. Nocturnal observations
   were made using a light intensifier (x60,000). At the colony, the number
   of copulations observed during the da! was similar to that observed at
   night. However, significantly more copulations were interrupted during
   the day than at night. Incubation attentiveness was significantly
   greater during diurnal observations compared to nocturnal observations.
   This is probably due to the fact that predation was more prevalent at
   night. Chicks were fed significantly more often during diurnal
   observations than at night. Nocturnal predators elicited responses
   typical of diurnal predators, but nocturnal anti-predatory behaviors
   were less intense and could involve nest abandonment for up to several
   hours. Away from the colony, gulls were very rarely seen on land at
   night. Gulls were observed on water at all phases of the breeding cycle
   during both the day and the night. During the day, gulls were typically
   observed as singles or pairs on the water, whereas at night the gulls
   were observed in significantly larger groups (>5000 individuals),
   especially during the colony settlement/laying period. These large,
   vocal groups may provide protection from predators, as well as
   facilitating the formation and maintenance of pair-bonds, and
   synchronization of pairs within a subcolony.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{452-458}},
Abstract = {{Most Northern Hemisphere ducks form pairs on the wintering grounds, and
   timing of pairing varies considerably among species and populations.
   Hypotheses to explain variation in pairing chronology utilize
   sex-specific cost-benefit frameworks. These hypotheses have not been
   adequately tested, largely because of inadequate sample size of pairing
   chronologies, especially within the tribe Mergini. Wintering Common
   (Mergus merganser), Hooded (Lophodytes cucullatus), and Red-breasted
   mergansers (M. serratus) were observed at several sites in southwest
   British Columbia to determine pairing chronology. Courtship displays of
   Wooded Mergansers occurred significantly earlier than those of
   Red-breasted Mergansers. Hooded Mergansers began to pair in
   mid-November, Red-breasted Mergansers in early February and Common
   Mergansers in late February. We tested the prediction that the largest
   species of ducks pair earliest. This could occur if females derive
   energetic benefits as a result of pairing, and females of larger species
   begin to accumulate endogenous nutrients earlier. It could also occur if
   pairing exerts an energetic cost oil males, such that males of smaller
   species are more prone to winter mortality as a result of fluctuations
   in energy demand. The much earlier pairing of the smallest species
   (Hooded Mergansers) is inconsistent with either scenario. We suggest
   that between-species differences in pairing chronology may be better
   explained by the constraints imposed by sexual segregation during
   winter.}},

Abstract = {{The fauna of Chile's Sala y Gomez island (26 degrees 28'S. 105 degrees
   21'W) is not well known because of the island's remote location, small
   size, and low profile. Previous literature about the bird life of this
   island consists of one report based on two visits of less than three
   hours duration, listing 11 species of seabirds, of which seven were
   observed breeding. The authors of the present study remained on the
   island for six days, during which time we observed 14 species of birds,
   ten of which were nesting. Both species richness and abundance were
   greater than reported previously. Sala I Gomez Island has significant
   breeding colonies of Blue-gray Noddy (Procelsterna cerulea) and
   Christmas Shearwater (Puffinus nativitatis). Also we recorded for the
   first time nesting by small numbers of Red-billed Tropicbirds (Phaethon
   aethereus) and White Terns (Gygis alba).}},

Abstract = {{The diving behavior of ten adult Rock Shag (Phalacrocorax magellanicus)
   foraging at Punta Loma, Patagonia, Argentina was studied, using
   radiotransmitters deployed during two chick-rearing periods. Shags dived
   continuously during foraging trips, spending 75\% of their time at sea
   underwater. Mean dive duration was 47 +/- 14 sec while mean subsequent
   surface interval was 14 +/- 6 sec (N = 11,212 dives). During both
   seasons, there was a weak linear relationship between dive duration and
   recovery time. Only four of the birds showed a positive and significant
   linear function between these diving parameters. Recovery time at the
   surface was independent of the previous dive time only during low tides.
   Dive efficiency (dive time/recovery time) was the highest reported for a
   foot-propelled diver (mean = 3.7 and 4.2 for 1996 and 1997,
   respectively). Food resources located in shallow waters at Punta Loma
   allowed the shags to optimize their searching period underwater by
   decreasing the energetic costs associated with diving.}},

   selection with respect to age or experience or by factors linked to the
   life-history traits of that species. However, when mate changes
