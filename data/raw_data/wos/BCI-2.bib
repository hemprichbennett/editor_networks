Abstract = {{Understanding the habitat needs of White Eared-pheasant Crossoptilon
   crossoptilon and Blood Pheasant Ithaginis cruentus is important for
   their conservation. We carried out field surveys of the two pheasants
   around Zhujie Monastery, Daocheng County, Sichuan Province, China, using
   line transects. In total, 172200 x 200 M grid squares were obtained,
   including 56 active and 116 inactive ones for White Eared-pheasant and
   45 active and 127 inactive ones for Blood Pheasant. We analysed the
   occurrence of both species by logistic multiple regression. The most
   important variables in model 1 for White Eared-pheasant were distance to
   nearest permanent water, shrub cover, tree cover, tree height and herb
   cover. In model 2 for Blood Pheasant, distance to nearest permanent
   water, shrub cover, herb cover and herb height were most important. The
   occurrence of both pheasants was negatively related to distance to
   nearest permanent water and herb cover, and positively related to shrub
   cover. The occurrence of White Eared-pheasant was positively related to
   tree cover and tree height, and that of Blood Pheasant to herb height.
   Water, food and predation risk were the main ecological factors
   affecting the species' distribution. Based on the two predictive models,
   conservation management was proposed, to include management of
   selectively-logged areas and substituting other energy sources, such as
   electricity, for firewood.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Pacific Conservation Area contains one of Costa Rica's two
   viable, but threatened Scarlet Macaw Ara macao populations. For 14 years
   (1990-2003), we monitored the size of this population. Non-linear models
   fitted to 1990-1994 observations revealed seasonal and long-term changes
   in population size. The peak of annual population size occurred in
   August, with a cyclic range of about go birds between the lowest and
   highest points of the annual cycle. The best model also revealed a
   decline in population size of approximately eight birds counted per year
   or 4\% of the total population per year (1990-1994). Young-to-adult
   ratios calculated for the month of August during this study fluctuated
   around a baseline that averaged 6.1\% a year (1990-2003). These ratios
   exceeded 8\% for three different years (1995, 1996 and 2000). All three
   of these ``good{''} recruitment years occurred after management began,
   and two of them were associated with zealous anti-poaching efforts that
   ultimately could not be sustained. After intensive management practices
   began in 1995, the August counts increased by about 37 individuals in
   two years (1995-1996) to an average 243 individuals, which remained
   almost constant up to 2003. Management practices included creation of a
   local conservation organization that coordinated environmental
   education, artificial nest construction, networking among stakeholders
   and with governmental authorities, and artificial and natural nest
   protection. Although Scarlet Macaw conservation efforts have been
   inconsistent since 1997, our study demonstrates that collaborative
   conservation by local stakeholders increased the population of this
   threatened species in 1995-1996, and from 1996 to present the population
   has sustained itself.}},

Abstract = {{Powerlines may pose severe threats to bird populations. We assessed the
   significance of powerlines as a source of avian mortality within the
   Italian electric transmission and distribution system. We reviewed data
   from 11. mortality censuses and compiled a list of species that were
   found among powerline victims in Italy, based on over 1,300 reported
   individual casualties. Overall, 95 species of birds were reported among
   powerline victims (19\% of Italy's total species). The number of
   recorded species was compared with the number of species in the Italian
   list, after grouping species based on morphology and ecology. Some
   groups (e.g. raptors, herons, storks and allies) were highly affected,
   while others (e.g. passerines and allies) appeared to be poorly
   represented among species involved in powerline accidents. Furthermore,
   we evaluated the validity of a published discriminant model for the
   classification of bird species as collision or electrocution victims
   according to body measurements. The application of the available model
   classified 54.7-73.5\% of Italian species correctly (depending on the
   species included), compared with 88.6\% of the original dataset. Two new
   discriminant models based on Italian powerline casualties classified
   80.9-81.1\% of species correctly. This approach can be a useful tool in
   assessing collision and electrocution risk for species in different
   geographical areas. While we recognize the need for a general preventive
   approach for reducing the bird-powerline conflict, our review highlights
   once more the importance of local situations, where powerlines may have
   a strong impact on avian communities.}},

Abstract = {{The transition to the use of non-toxic shot and fishing weights has been
   slow at the international level despite the Bern Convention and the
   African Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) having called for
   a ban on lead Shot use by the year 2000. Adopting lead substitutes is
   also consistent with the habitat goals of the Ramsar Convention and the
   Biodiversity Convention. In countries where non-toxic shot and sinkers
   are required by law, published studies show a marked reduction in lead
   toxicosis and large savings of birds. A renewed commitment from the
   AEWA, the Bern Convention, and especially the Ramsar Convention is
   needed to encourage their parties to regulate the use of non-toxic
   materials. Eleven different non-toxic substitutes for shot now exist,
   and some of these can also serve as substitutes for lead sinkers. While
   previous regulatory emphasis has been placed oil wetland habitats, any
   new initiatives could also propose a phasing out of lead shot in upland
   habitats to reduce the prevalence of secondary lead poisoning of
   migratory raptors.}},

Abstract = {{The global population of the Critically Endangered Raso Lark Alauda
   razac was estimated in January 2003 at 93-103 birds and in November 2003
   at 76-87 birds. Of these, only 25-35\% were females. Counts were based
   on observations of individually colour-ringed and measured birds. Birds
   were not breeding during the January visit, and were concentrated in two
   small areas at opposite ends of the island of Raso. This distribution
   differed substantially from that recorded previously during the breeding
   season. Three different feeding strategies were apparent: flocking,
   aggregating around key resources and feeding singly or in pairs. Birds
   moving to new feeding areas immediately adopted the feeding strategy of
   other birds present. Birds were seen drinking seawater on several
   occasions. In November 2003, birds were breeding but nest survival was
   extremely low due to high rates of egg predation. No evidence was
   detected of introduced predators on Rase. However, a population of feral
   cats was found on nearby Santa Luzia, prohibiting natural colonization
   or deliberate introduction of Raso Lark to the island, despite much
   apparently suitable habitat there. Faecal analyses showed that these
   cats feed largely on skinks. Increased tourism development on
   neighbouring islands is identified as a potential threat to the species.}},

Abstract = {{In 2001 and 2002, we assessed avian richness in Linggoasri (central
   Java) where almost all lowland rainforest had been cleared 3 years
   previously. Bird surveys were carried out in a selectively-logged
   forest, two regenerating forests and one pine Pinus merkusii plantation.
   A comparison with a bird list complied at least 3 years prior to logging
   in Linggoasri showed that 10 lowland bird species may have been
   extirpated from this area following logging. However, further surveys
   will be needed to validate these extirpations. A comparison with a list
   of lowland forest birds of Java shows that only 37\% of these occurred
   in Linggoasri. From the lowland avifauna of Java, sole frugivores and
   insectivores were less likely to be present in Linggoasri. Smaller,
   generalist-feeding lowland species, endemic to Java, were more likely to
   be present in this area. Persisting lowland bird species, however, did
   not appear to be seriously affected physiologically by habitat
   degradation, showing no significant loss of body condition or reduction
   in survival and reproduction. There is an urgent need to preserve the
   few remaining lowland forest patches of Java and, given the alarming
   rate of deforestation throughout Southeast Asia, it is critical to
   conserve adequately large primary lowland forests (e.g. > 5,000 ha) if
   we arc to preserve existing lowland avifauna.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the causes and consequences of disturbance to the chicks of
   Hooded Plover Thinornis rubricollis in central southern Victoria,
   Australia. Humans were the most frequent source of encounters, and
   response rates to a variety of stimuli were high. Three possible
   mechanisms by which disturbance could reduce chick survival were
   evaluated. (1) Disturbance might cause thermal stress to chicks. An
   encounter with a human often caused brooding to cease, but it is not
   clear whether overall levels of brooding were compromised. Chicks found
   themselves un-brooded due to disturbance for up to 290 min, and in
   ambient temperatures of 10-46 degrees C. (2) Disturbance might cause
   energetic stress to chicks. Encounters with humans usually caused chick
   foraging to stop. Higher levels of disturbance were associated with less
   chick foraging. There was a tendency for broods to forage in lower and
   potentially more profitable levels of the habitat in less-disturbed
   conditions. However, the overall pattern of habitat use was similar
   during disturbed and less-disturbed conditions. (3) Adult defence of
   broods could be compromised by disturbance. However, no brood predation
   occurred in disturbed circumstances, and adults stayed close to their
   broods even in disturbed conditions. These data suggest that defence of
   chicks was not compromised by disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Endemic to the islands of Guam and Rota in the Mariana islands, Mariana
   Crow Corvus kubaryi is the only corvid in Micronesia. Currently, it
   survives on Guam only because of translocation of individuals from Rota
   (1999-2003). island-wide surveys in 1982 and 1995 on Rota yielded
   population estimates Of 1,348 and 592 respectively, indicating a 56\%
   decrease in only 13 years. A sharp decline in the only viable Mariana
   Crow Population has serious implications for conservation efforts on
   Rota and for efforts to re-establish the Guam population. However, the
   validity of the apparent decline has been debated among scientists and
   government management agencies. We augmented the 1982 and 1995
   island-wide VCP surveys with (1) an additional island-wide survey
   conducted in 1998, and (2) roadside surveys conducted during 1991-1993
   and again during 1999-2002. We also outline historical changes in Rota's
   limestone forest based on aerial photographs and historical information.
   Data from all surveys indicate a significant decline in the Mariana Crow
   population. Declines occurred especially along the north-central coast
   and in the area east of the airport known as As Dodo in the 1990s, but
   the data indicate an island-wide decline over the entire span of the
   surveys. Introduced predators, human persecution, and habitat loss and
   degradation by anthropogenic and natural causes have all contributed to
   the decline. Long-term preservation of this species will require
   effective brown treesnake Boiga irregularis control, habitat protection,
   continued monitoring and research, and increased public education and
   awareness of Rota's rare and endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary survey for Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi was undertaken at
   five sites within the species' historical range in the Tanintharyi
   (Tenasserim) Division of Myanmar from 14 to 24 May 2003. During the
   surveys, Gurney's Pittas were heard and/or observed at four sites with a
   maximum Of 10-12 pairs recorded at one site. Birds were encountered in
   logged primary and secondary forest below 100 m on flat ground,
   sometimes less than 10 m from forest edge. All encounters were within 2
   kin of the main trans-Tanintharyi highway. Landsat satellite imagery was
   used to map remaining lowland forests and Gurney's Pitta habitat ill the
   Tanintharyi Division. Our analysis demonstrated that Only 4,705 km(2) of
   lowland forest remain with about 3,496 km(2) in flat areas with slopes
   \&LT; 10\&DEG;. On the basis of previously reported population
   densities, these habitats My Support a population Of 5,152-8,586 pairs.
   Much of the remaining habitat is restricted to small and fragmented
   patches \&LT; 1 km(2), in area. The five largest patches have a total
   area Of 1,431 km(2) and range in size from 137 to 467 km(2). This survey
   demonstrated that Gurney's Pitta still occurs within its historical
   range in Myanmar, although probably not at any of the historical
   collecting localities visited. The global population of Gurney's Pitta
   is at least 100\% greater than the latest published estimate. This
   Survey has also shown that the Gurney's Pitta population in southern
   Taninthiryi Division is under pressure from forest conversion to oil
   palm. Contrary to the Situation in neighbouring Thailand, sufficient
   forest remains to establish landscape level protected areas covering a
   broad ecological continuum. Securing populations of Gurney's Pitta
   within either expanded or entirely new protected areas must be the best
   chance for the species and the Sundaic flora and fauna of which it is
   part.}},

Abstract = {{The urgent global objective of developing sustainable tropical forestry
   management practices, which also target biodiversity conservation,
   requires rapid comparative studies that address both biogeography and
   logging practices. This paper examines avifaunal implications (focusing
   on species diversity and composition) of forest fragmentation and
   selective logging, by comparing 15 selected reserved forests in
   south-west Ghana. The regeneration time since last logging varied from 0
   (logging continuing) to 21 years, with one unlogged site as control.
   Extraction levels ranged between 0.20 and 3-75 trees per ha (mean 0.90).
   Bird sampling involved understorey mist-netting and standardized
   line-transect walks, which respectively accumulated 8,348 captures and
   22,452 single records Of 147 species. Mist-net data showed that
   understorey bird diversity was positively correlated with logging
   intensity up to c. 3 trees per ha, reflecting increased influx of
   open-land species and a persistence of forest obligates during the first
   5 years after logging. The overall abundance of forest interior species
   tended to decrease 5-10 years after logging, but recovered fairly well
   thereafter. Canopy birds were generally more logging-resilient. Rare
   forest obligates with high conservation importance were found to be
   equally abundant in virgin and logged, large forests, whereas these
   birds were poorly represented in small heavily logged forests. The
   results are compared with findings from other regions, and conservation
   implications and constraints are discussed in a global perspective.
   Finally, recommendations on size-related sustainable extraction levels
   and regeneration time are presented for the Upper Guinea Forest.}},

   Sunbirds within the ASF. Forty transects were surveyed over 3 months in
   1999. The total length of all transects was 63.572 km. In total, 103
   Amani Sunbirds were detected at an estimated density of 36.6
   birds/km(2). Thus with a total area of 77 km(2), the Brachystegia
   woodland of the ASF should hold about 2,818 Amani Sunbirds. This
   estimate is much lower than the 5,800-9,400 birds estimated by Britton
   and Britton (1978). While it is possible that their estimate was
   inaccurate, the apparent decline in the population could be due to
   natural population fluctuations. Habitat degradation is another possible
   cause, as illegal logging and tree-felling continue in and around the
   ASF. Since the majority of the local people around the ASF are farmers,
   there is little concern for the welfare of the forest, especially when
   they see few benefits stemming from conserving the resource. Future
   funding towards the conservation of the ASF should focus on (1) setting
   up a consistent monitoring programme that will provide further
   population estimates for endangered species such as Amani Sunbird, and
   (2) ensuring that local people get some benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Tricolored Blackbird Agelaius tricolor is a rapidly declining species
   largely endemic to California and forms larger breeding colonies than
   any other extant North American landbird following the extinction of
   Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratoritts. We present information on its
   distribution, breeding habitat and changes in global population size
   using data collected since the 1930s. We also present data on
   reproductive Success at 103 colonies between 1992 and 2003. While
   possibly once the most abundant bird throughout much of its range, it
   declined by over 50\% between the 1930s and early 1990s, and by a
   further c. 56\% between 1994 and 2000. The global population is now
   smaller than the historic size of some individual breeding colonies.
   Reproductive success was significantly higher in upland non-native
   vegetation (primarily Himalayan blackberry Rubus discolor) than in
   native emergent cattail Typha spp. and bulrush Scripus spp. marshes, its
   likely predominant historic breeding habitat. Contemporary losses of
   important upland nesting substrate, combined with low reproductive
   success in native habitats and complete breeding failure in harvested
   agricultural fields, are the most likely causes of recent declines.
   Recovery of this species presents possible conflicts in conservation
   policy because Successful reproduction now largely depends on invasive
   non-native plants and the willingness of farmers to delay harvest or to
   lose portions of their crops.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the diet of breeding Olrog's Gulls Larus atlanticus during
   1994 at two colonies in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, through the analysis
   Of 207 regurgitated pellets. The diet at Isla Felipe and Isla Vernaci
   Sudoeste comprised only a few items (9 vs 7 respectively), of which
   crabs were the main component. At Isla Felipe, the crabs Cyrtograpsus
   altimanus and C. angulatus were present in 91.2\% and 89.2\% of pellets,
   respectively, while the percentage contribution of each species was
   76.1\% and 21.7\%, respectively. At Isla Vernaci Sudoeste, the figures
   were similar (96.2\% and 80\% of pellets, and percentage contributions
   79.4\% and 19-5\%). All other taxa were present in less than 11\% of
   pellets. No significant differences were found between colonies in the
   number of prey items, prey individuals per pellet, and consumption of
   crabs. Percentage contribution of crabs differed significantly between
   stages of the breeding cycle at Isla Felipe but not at Isla Vernaci
   Sudoeste. At both colonies, the proportion of male C. altimanus in
   pellets was larger than that of females. The proportion of female C.
   angulatus in pellets at Isla Vernaci Sudoeste was larger than that of
   males, but no significant differences were found in the consumption of
   each sex at Isla Felipe. Mean maximum carapace width of male crabs in
   pellets was not significantly different from that of females at either
   Isla Felipe or Isla Vernaci. Our study at Golfo San Jorge confirms that
   Olrog's Gull is fairly specialized, feeding mainly on crabs during the
   breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{A molecular phylogeny of the Spizaetus cirrhatus complex is presented in
   this study, based on two sections of the mitochondrial genome: partial
   sequences of the cytochrome b gene and of the control region (CR). The
   topologies derived from the two sequences are in agreement. Within S.
   cirrhatus distances are rather low (0-1.5\% in cytochrome b). Among the
   cirrhatus subspecies the island taxa floris, vanheurni and andamanensis
   form distinct haplogroups in the CR trees, conforming to the earlier
   subspecific divisions which were based on morphological characters. On
   the other hand, the most widespread Subspecies, limnacetus, does not
   represent a monophyletic group in the gene trees and its haplogroups do
   not Cluster according to geographic affinities. An unambiguous
   resolution of relationships among haplotypes and haplogroups,
   respectively, was not achieved, suggesting a more recent radiation of
   this group of hawk-eagles in the course of the last ice ages. Concerning
   the outgroup taxa Spizaetus philippensis and Spizaetus lanceolatus, our
   data indicate a clear genetic distinction between the two subspecies S.
   P. philippensis and S. p. pinskeri, suggesting that they should be
   treated as distinct species. Yet the phylogenetic relationships of the
   three outgroup taxa with respect to S. cirrhatus are ambiguous in our
   trees. The taxonomic consequences of applying different species concepts
   (BSC, PSC) are discussed. The species concept chosen would result in
   different conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The past five years have seen the arrival and extremely rapid expansion
   of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Western Hemisphere. The rapid sweep
   across North America has permitted little time for developing knowledge
   of the virus's potential impacts on wildlife in the New World. Given
   this information gap, we here summarize for the ornithological community
   what is known or can be anticipated for WNV's effect on bird communities
   in coming years. Our particular focus is on impacts of WNV on the
   conservation status of birds, the principal vertebrate reservoir for the
   virus.}},

Abstract = {{Black Harrier Circus maurus is a rare southern African endemic that may
   have lost over 50\% of its core breeding habitat in the last century as
   a result of extensive land transformation by agriculture, invasive alien
   vegetation and urbanization in the Fynbos biome. We partially sun,eyed
   both the western (Swartland) and southern (Overberg) coastal plains of
   south-western South Africa, Over 3 years (2000-2002) for breeding Black
   Harriers, and found a distinctly polarized distribution. Nests were
   concentrated either along the coastal strip or inland in montane
   habitats, and generally absent from heavily cultivated and transformed
   inland plains areas. Limited evidence (direct observations, prey
   remains) suggests that harriers forage in cereal croplands but generally
   do not breed in these modified environments. We recorded breeding
   success at nests in coastal (Dune Thicket) and montane (Mountain Fynbos)
   habitats. Harriers bred successfully along the coast and nests were
   aggregated in loose colonies around wetlands. Harriers in montane
   environments bred poorly, took a wide range of prey, and were subject to
   high levels of nest predation. We propose that Black Harriers have been
   displaced from lowland Renosterveld and Fynbos habitats (characterized
   by better foraging and nesting opportunities), primarily by the advent
   and spread of cereal agriculture. The consenation and future research
   implications of this hypothesis are discussed.}},

Title = {{The conservation status and vocalizations of threatened birds from the

Abstract = {{The western Angola Endemic Bird Area has 14 range-restricted species.
   Little is known about the conservation status of the region's birds due
   to the civil war that has raged in Angola for the last 27 years. The
   greatest diversity of restricted-range species is found in Cuanza Sul
   province, and given the uncertainty about their current status, many of
   these species are listed as Threatened. In this paper we report the
   first significant ornithological visits to the Gabela region since 1974.
   We visited an extensive scarp forest patch at Kumbira Primero, near
   Conda, as well as smaller forest areas along the Sumbe-Gabela and
   Sumbe-Seles roads. Most of the threatened species were relocated,
   including several species not seen since the 1970s. Gabela Bush-shrike
   Laniarius amboimensis was common and Monteiro's Bush-shrike Malaconotus
   monteiri was fairly common in degraded secondary forest, old coffee
   plantations and primary forest at Kumbira. Pulitzer's Longbill
   Macrosphenus pulitzeri was fairly common at higher elevations at Kumbira
   as well as in the dense understorey of secondary forest vest of Seles.
   Gabela Akalat Sheppardia gabela was less common, with only three birds
   found at Kumbira and one near Seles, but may have been overlooked. Only
   one group of eight Gabela Helmet-shrike Prionops gabela was recorded, in
   open woodland at the base of the scarp between Kumbira and 5eles.
   -Angola Cave-chat Xenocopsychus ansorgei was found on the rocky slopes
   above the forest at Kumbira. We describe the first sound recordings for
   five threatened species, which will help future systematic surveys of
   the region's forests. Vocal evidence confirms the close relationship
   between Gabela Bush-shrike and Luhder's Bush-shrike L. luehderi. The
   most pressing need is to assess the extent of remaining forests, map the
   distribution of key species of conservation concern, and then draft a
   strategy to conserve key habitat blocks.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of threatened lowland forest bird species and forest habitats
   were conducted during a 21-month census of lowland bird communities in
   Tambopata, Department of Madre de Dios, south-east Peru. A combination
   of distance sampling census methods and direct counts was used for the
   census in five sites located along the Rio Madre de Dios and Rio
   Tambopata. All five sites consisted of different forest types with
   significantly different habitat components. Three of these sites were
   classified as primary forest habitats whilst the remaining two were
   classified as disturbed forests. Population densities were calculated
   for eight of the threatened species recorded during the census. Density
   estimates of non-bamboo specialists were higher in primary forest
   habitats than in disturbed forest habitats. Density estimates of most
   bamboo specialists were hi-her in primary Old Floodplain forest with
   extensive bamboo understorey than in primary Middle/Upper Floodplain
   forest with smaller, patchy areas of bamboo understorey. Calculation of
   regional Population estimates based on the amount of forest cover from
   satellite photographs shows that only two of the threatened bird species
   have substantial populations currently protected by the Parque Nacional
   Bahuaja-Sonene and Reservada Nacional de Tambopata. Selective logging
   operations that reduce overall tree biomass and remove a Jar e
   proportion of palm tree species from primary forest habitats will have
   an adverse affect on local populations of four of the threatened bird
   species in the region.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Vietnamese Mekong Delta has undergone much anthropogenic change in
   the last 100 years, and few areas of natural or semi-natural habitat
   remain. Despite the likely consequent loss of biodiversity, little
   documentation exists about the region's avifauna at any time in its
   history. Here, we present a review of the avifauna of the Vietnamese
   part of the Mekong delta based on various surveys and other fieldwork
   carried out since 1988, and an assessment of the few earlier data that
   were available. A total of 247 species has been recorded from the
   Vietnamese delta since 1988. Most pre-war data are now considered to be
   of uncertain validity. Some 50\% of the species recorded since 1988 are
   dependent on wetlands. Of these 20 are listed as globally threatened or
   Near Threatened. The delta supports, or is likely to support,
   internationally important numbers of 21 species of waterbird, including
   two threatened and three Near Threatened species. Annotations are
   provided for records of globally or regionally threatened species; for
   those species for which the Mekong Delta holds internationally important
   numbers; and those for which records described herein constitute range
   extensions. Information on the avifauna of the Mekong Delta presented
   here suggests it is of regional and global importance for the
   maintenance of wetland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Group size and habitat use of Black-necked Storks Ephippiorhynchus
   asiaticus were studied over a 30-month period in an unprotected
   landscape with a mosaic of natural and man-made features in Etawah and
   Mainpuri districts, Uttar Pradesh, India. Group size was largely one or
   two and never more than a family of two adults and three young. Group
   size did not change with season or across habitat types. Black-necked
   Storks used habitats to different extents across years and seasons.
   Wetlands were preferred in all seasons and rice-paddies were preferred
   during the monsoon. The use of irrigation canals was consistent across
   seasons and was always in proportion to their availability. Irrigation
   canals and crop-fields, particularly flooded rice-fields, provided some
   additional habitat to Black-necked Storks, but catered to the population
   for a very small period of time. While some studies have demonstrated
   that flooded rice-fields are useful for wintering waterbird species,
   conversion of natural wetlands to crop-fields will not be advantageous
   to Black-necked Storks, and these habitats need to be preserved to
   conserve the species.}},

Abstract = {{Gull-billed Tern Gelochelidon nilotica is classed as Endangered in
   Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Hagemeijer and Blair, 1997), but there
   have been no detailed studies of the trends in the different populations
   occurring in Europe and Africa. Here we study the status and trends of
   the species in Europe and north and north-east Africa. We estimate the
   total population at 10,500-12,000 breeding pairs, and recognize two
   biogeographic populations in this region. The western population,
   comprising colonies in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands, Germany),
   France, Italy, Spain, and north and north-east Africa, consists of at
   most 6,200 pairs, 1,800 of which are in African colonies. The eastern
   population, comprising colonies in the Balkan Peninsula, Greece, shores
   of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, and Turkey, consists of at most 6,800
   pairs. Two trends were observed: a first phase from 1900 up to the
   mid-1970s in which the northern European populations practically
   disappeared; and a second phase of stabilization, or even increase, in
   some of the western colonies, while the eastern Population continued to
   decline. There is a marked concentration of the species in just a few
   localities in the countries of the Mediterranean basin.}},

Abstract = {{Food habits of Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus were
   studied from December 2000 to December 2001, in the Athikadavu valley,
   Western Ghats, India. A total Of 147 individuals belonging to 18
   fleshy-fruited tree species were monitored fortnightly. Thirteen fruit
   species, including five figs and eight non-figs, were recorded in the
   birds' diet. The overall number of tree species in fruit and fruiting
   individuals increased with the onset of summer, the Malabar Pied
   Hornbill's breeding season. The peak in fruiting is attributed to the
   peak in fruiting by figs. Figs formed the top three preferred food
   species throughout the year. During the non-breeding period (May to
   February), 60\% of the diet was figs. During the peak breeding period
   (March and April), two nests were monitored for 150 hours. Ninety-eight
   per cent of food deliveries to nest inmates were fruits belonging to six
   species. Most fruits delivered at the nests constituted figs (75.6\%).
   In addition, figs sustained hornbills during the lean season and should
   be considered `' keystone species `' in the riverine forest ecosystem.
   Two non-fig species are also important. Habitat features and local
   threats at Athikadavu valley were assessed. The distribution and
   conservation status of Malabar Pied Hornbill in the Western Ghats was
   reviewed. Conservation of hornbill habitats, particularly the lowland
   riparian vegetation, is imperative.}},

Abstract = {{Nest-site selection by the sympatric Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis,
   Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus and Oriental Pied Hornbill
   Anthracoceros albirostris was investigated in a lowland tropical forest
   in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India during 1997-2000. Information on
   two nests of Rufous-necked Hornbill Aceros nipalensis in
   higher-elevation forests is also presented. All species nested in live
   trees of three tree genera, 83\% (n = 36) in Tetrameles nudiflora, an
   emergent deciduous softwood, relatively common in lowland foothill
   forests. No difference was recorded in nest-tree species or nesting
   habitats of sympatric hornbills, but there were a few differences in
   structural characteristics of nest-trees. Cavity size was the main
   variable separating the three species. Great Hornbills used larger
   cavities while Oriental Pied Hornbills used smaller cavities closer to
   riverine areas. Nesting was attempted at 64\% of known sites and
   successful fledging of chicks was 80\% overall (n = 72 nests, pooled
   over 4 years). Nest-trees in disturbed habitats near human habitation
   were used but were often abandoned or unsuccessful and 50\% of all
   nest-trees were inactive by the end of the study. Potential large
   nest-trees had a density Of 5.9/ha, that of the two most used species
   was 1.3/ha, and minimum nest densities of all three species was about 1
   pair/km(2). Interference competition for nest-sites was not observed,
   despite similarity in nest-tree characteristics, low nest density and
   high loss of nest-trees. Nest-site availability may naturally limit
   hornbill populations in the area, and additional loss of nesting habitat
   to human activities may exacerbate limited availability of breeding
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the diets of four hornbill species (Bushy-crested
   Hornbill Anorrhinus galeritus, Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus,
   Rhinoceros Hornbill Buceros rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbill Buceros
   vigil) common within our 9 km(2) study area in the Bukit Barisan Selatan
   National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia. Line transects and opportunistic
   sampling were used over one year to collect feeding data, including the
   tree species and strata in which birds fed, diet items, fruit
   characteristics and tree crop size. Hornbills fed on 64 species. Figs,
   non-fig fruits and animals comprised 23.4\% (n = 15 species) 51.6\% (n =
   33 species) and 25\% (n = 16 species) of the diet, respectively.
   Although there was overlap among the diets of the four species, only B.
   rhinoceros and B. vigil had a statistically significant overlap,
   primarily due to high fig consumption by both species. B. vigil fed
   almost exclusively on figs (98.6 \% of the diet) and a small proportion
   of animals (1.4\%) while 23.1\% of the B. rhinoceros diet comprised
   non-fig fruits and animals (23.1.\%), with 76.9\% figs. A. galeritus and
   A. undulatus had distinct diets with drupaceous, oily fruits comprising
   66.7\% and 64.4\% of the diets, respectively. We found no significant
   relationship between the numbers of hornbills visiting fruiting trees
   and the characteristics of the fruit (weight, length and width).
   However, maximum crop sizes of diet species significantly influenced the
   number of feeding hornbills. Hornbill species also differed in the
   strata in which they fed. A. galeritus and B. rhinoceros were seen in
   the middle of the canopy 56\% and 50.8\% of the time, respectively while
   A. undulatus and B. vigil were observed more frequently in the upper
   canopy (50\% and 74-3\% of the time, respectively). The lower part of
   the canopy was used infrequently by all species. This study suggests
   that the four hornbill species in our study partition food resources by
   food type and/or feeding location.}},

Abstract = {{Asian hornbills are primarily frugivorous. We studied the
   characteristics of fruits consumed by four sympatric hornbill species in
   Thailand: Great Hornbill (Buceros bicornis), Wreathed Hornbill (Aceros
   undulatus), Austin's Brown Hornbill (Anorrhinus austeni) and Oriental
   Pied Hornbill (Anthracoceros albirostris). We compared the frequency of
   distribution of 11 variables for all fruit species collected in the
   study area (n = 259) and fruit species consumed by hornbills (n = 73).
   Our analysis revealed that fruits consumed by hornbills are: (1) large,
   (2) easily accessible within the canopy, (3) red, purple or black and
   (4) dehiscent or indehiscent with a thin husk. The range of fruit sizes
   eaten by hornbills in our study is comparable to that reported from
   other sites in Southeast Asia and Africa. The large gape width of
   hornbills enables them to consume large fruits that small frugivores
   would find difficult to consume.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes current knowledge and outlines future work on the
   breeding biology of Southern Ground Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri in
   Zimbabwe. All available records since 1900 were analysed, including
   casual reports by members of BirdLife Zimbabwe and published records.
   Estimates were made for the start and end of the breeding season, group
   sizes, clutch size and productivity levels, together with an assessment
   of preferred habitats and nest-tree species. There is a need for
   intensive fieldwork to determine aspects of breeding biology such as
   incubation and nestling periods. Particularly important for sound
   management and conservation strategies is relative breeding success in
   different land-tenure systems. The author has started work in a communal
   area 40 km south of Bulawayo city; land-use systems such as new
   resettlement areas, commercial farms and protected areas remain to be
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{Internal security problems from the 1960s up until 1998 prevented any
   fieldwork in Cambodia. Since then, the situation has improved greatly
   and the Royal Government of Cambodia, in collaboration with
   international conservation NGOs, has been conducting general biological
   surveys across the country. Survey reports were used to investigate
   current occurrence of hornbills. Historically, three hornbill species -
   Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis, Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus and
   Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris - were known from
   Cambodia. Recent surveys show that populations of Great and Wreathed
   Hornbills have declined significantly since the 1960s, while Oriental
   Pied is still common. A fourth hornbill species, Brown Hornbill
   Anorrhinus tickelli, was reported in 1998 in Kirirom National Park
   spanning the border of Koh Kong and Kompong Speu provinces in south-west
   Cambodia. Conservation priorities and priorities for future surveys are
   being developed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the influence of forest fragmentation and resource
   availability on the abundance and distribution of Sumba Hornbill Aceros
   everetti, a large, canopy-dwelling bird endemic to Sumba Island,
   Indonesia. Hornbill numbers were estimated monthly from August 1998 to
   September 1999. Estimates were made in three large ( >=,1,000 ha) and
   three small (< 1,000 ha) forest fragments, using a standard line
   transect method. Phenological patterns of canopy trees were assessed in
   10 X 50 m Plots. Our data indicated that forest patch size may be a
   better predictor of Sumba Hornbill abundance and distribution than
   overall resource availability. Hornbills occurred at higher densities in
   large forests (6/km(2)) than small forests (2-4/kM(2)). Small forests
   produced more fruit/ha per month but lacked a number of important
   hornbill food species. Monthly fruit availability in large and small
   forest fragments had no significant effect on fluctuations in hornbill
   density. However, hornbill densities were significantly higher in
   forests with high densities of strangling figs, after controlling for
   patch size, and in larger forests hornbill densities correlated with the
   abundance of ripe figs. We hypothesize that small patches still have
   conservation value if they are within hornbill ranging distance, and
   speculate that Sumba's forests are in a dynamic phase before the full
   impact of fragmentation has been expressed.}},

Abstract = {{The habitat requirements of a resident population of Bittern Botaurus
   stellaris were investigated during the breeding season in a
   Mediterranean upland wetland, with particular reference to the area's
   isolation from other wetlands, its small size and hydrological
   conditions. Vegetation structure and water-level were described and
   associated with booming male and nesting female distribution within the
   marsh. A logistic regression model showed that water-level was the only
   significant factor affecting the distribution of booming males, which
   occupied areas seasonally flooded with shallower water (< 1. m). Females
   nested in seasonally flooded zones, while vegetation density appeared an
   important variable for nesting-site choice. Management of the wet area
   is discussed and the importance of a better understanding of the
   temporal dynamics of vegetation cover and spatial and temporal
   variations in water-level, and their possible effects on prey
   distribution, is highlighted.}},

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{165-172}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The diet of the endemic Madeira Laurel Pigeon Columba trocaz in
   agricultural and forest areas of Madeira Island was studied in 1997 by
   means of microhistological analysis of 157 faecal samples, 94 from two
   of the main agricultural zones and 63 from a laurel forest. Cabbage was
   the most important component of the diet in agricultural areas,
   representing more than 54\% of the optical fields analysed. Samples
   collected further from the forest contained a higher proportion of
   cabbage. Native fruits did not figure highly in the samples collected
   from agricultural areas and crop plants did not appear in the forest
   samples, suggesting a degree of dietary separation and that some
   individuals may concentrate on crops. Madeira Laurel Pigeon is normally
   a highly frugivorous species and fruit availability is relatively high
   in winter when the birds go to agricultural areas to feed. This suggests
   that it is not a shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the
   forest. The unpopularity of the pigeon as a result of its pest status is
   the main threat to its existence. More information on the seasonal
   physiological requirements of Madeira Laurel Pigeon and the pattern of
   individual use of crops is needed to ensure the future conservation of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{There are no previous studies supporting the link between the decline of
   Roller Coracias garrulus populations in the Palaearctic and agricultural
   intensification. We studied the effect of farming practices on Roller
   reproduction during 1988-1991 in south-west Spain. Nest-boxes were
   installed on power pylons that crossed six different man-made habitats
   representing the most characteristic habitats in the Mediterranean
   region: pasture fields with and without holm oak Quercus roffindifolia
   trees, cereal fields with and without holm oak trees, scrub fields and
   irrigated fields. Rollers nesting in nest-boxes erected in unwooded
   pasture field had the highest breeding success, suggesting that this is
   the most suitable nesting habitat of Rollers in the region. There were
   no significant effects of farming practices in habitat adjacent to nests
   on Roller laying date and clutch size. However, after controlling for
   laying date, current agricultural practices around nests affected chick
   mortality, with higher losses in irrigated fields. Breeding success and
   egg productivity were also affected by farming activities, with the
   lowest values in irrigated fields. Future conservation plans for Rollers
   should consider that nest-box provision might increase habitat
   suitability for Roller reproduction and that highly intensified
   agricultural practices might have deleterious effects on Roller
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon is an Endangered species that has
   experienced a severe but short-lived population bottleneck in recent
   years. Only one wild population and two captive populations exist in
   China today, all of which were probably initiated from two breeding
   pairs rediscovered in 1981. This paper represents the first study of the
   genetic diversity of Crested This by analysing sequence variation of a
   fragment spanning domains II and III of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   control region of both wild and captive populations. Two haplotypes were
   identified in both wild and captive populations, and the captive
   population had a bias towards haplotype 1. The species as a whole
   demonstrated an extremely low level of genetic diversity, with a
   haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of 0.386 +/- 0.074 and
   0.069\% +/- 0.013\%, respectively. Despite the rapid increase in numbers
   of birds under intensive management, the paucity of genetic diversity
   remains a real threat to the species. The mtDNA control region
   variations detected in the present study could provide significant
   information additional to the studbook data of Crested Ibis; therefore
   we suggest that special attention be paid to individuals with haplotype
   2 when considering captive breeding management. Overall, great care
   should be taken in the selection of reintroduction sites for this rare
   bird, as species with low genetic diversity are thought to be more
   limited in their ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental
   extremes and diseases.}},

Abstract = {{From March to July 2000, four seabird colonies in coastal ecosystems of
   Sinaloa, northwest Mexico were visited: on islets, a sandy beach and a
   long-abandoned salt-panning flat. There were partial and total breeding
   failures, most of them due to human activity. Amongst colonies of nine
   species, the breeding success of three was severely affected. All 250
   Royal Tern Sterna maxima eggs were taken for direct consumption; 50\%
   (75) of Blue-footed Booby Sula nebouxii chicks were killed for crab
   (Portunidae) fishing; and in a Least Tern Stenia antillarum colony (97
   pairs), 50\% failed due to disturbance from a fishing championship. Some
   of these species have priority status within Mexican and international
   conservation regulations. Certain aspects of these problems are
   discussed, and actions are suggested to balance conservation and the
   development of economic activities.}},

   implications for conservation and management}},
Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Pale-headed Brush-finch Atlapetes pallidiceps is a restricted-range
   species that is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss. The
   total population of 60-80 individuals achieved a reproductive output of
   only 0.74 young per breeding pair in 2002. Brood parasitism by Shiny
   Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis was a major factor reducing breeding
   success, affecting 38.5\% of broods. Parasitism rates reached 50\% in an
   ungrazed reserve, but only 14\% on an adjacent grazed plot. The
   resulting difference in breeding success was not, however, attributable
   to vegetation parameters used to describe microhabitat use. Cowbird
   parasitism rates therefore seem to be influenced largely by factors
   operating at the landscape level. These may include grazing scheme,
   topography, humidity and host availability. It is suggested that lower
   species diversity and bird abundance rendered the grazed site less
   attractive to cowbirds. Current parasitism rates are of great
   conservation concern due to the low population size of Pale-headed
   Brush-finch, and the initiation of controlling measures is pressing.
   Management options described from intensive cowbird control programmes
   in North America are reviewed and evaluated for their applicability
   here. To. combine the possibility of further data collection with
   commencement of immediate conservation action, we consider two
   alternative approaches. Nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal would
   enable the study of the distribution of parasitism in relation to
   landscape and vegetation variables, whereas cowbird shooting and nest
   monitoring might provide a larger short-term benefit to reproductive
   output. Habitat management, resumption of some grazing in the reserve
   and cowbird removal should be considered for the intermediate future.}},

Abstract = {{Pale-headed Brush-finch Atlapetes pallidiceps is on the verge of
   extinction, with fewer than 100 individuals surviving in an area of less
   than 4 km(2) in the Yunguilla valley in the province of Azuay, southern
   Ecuador. A reserve created for the protection of the species held 10 or
   12 pairs in 1999, 14 in 2000, 16 in 2001. and 17 in 2002. Nearly all
   males had distinctive songs, showing little or no change from one year
   to the next. The yearly turnover of singing males was 40\% in both 2000
   and 2001 (4/10), and 29\% in 2002 (4/14). Altitudinal range of A.
   pallidiceps was 1,650-1,950 m. Habitat was typical of regenerating
   landslides and fallow fields, composed of early succession growth in the
   ecotone between dry, thorny valley-bottom and humid forest remnants on
   the upper slopes. Territory size averaged 1.0 ha (range 0.7-1.4 ha, 11 =
   37), and nearly all territories were within loo m of a stream or an
   irrigation channel. Most were on steep slopes with Chusquea bamboo, and
   deciduous bushy cover with few or no spines, typically including the
   composite Steiractinia sodiroi, and with some open areas. Although
   habitat improved considerably between 1999 and 2002, some territories
   were vacant some years. Shiny Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis parasitism
   was noted, and could be even more important than habitat as a limiting
   factor of the population size. The song of A. pallidiceps was found to
   be similar to songs of several other Atlapetes spp. in general pattern.
   Diet was composed of arthropods, fruit and a few seeds. Arthropods were
   almost invariably picked from the bark on upper- and under-surfaces of
   twigs and small branches. Seeds were taken from the ground. Young
   (cowbirds) were apparently only fed insects. Between 1,8001 and 1,950 m
   A. pallidiceps occurred with Rufous-naped Brush-finch A. latinuchus,
   which replaces it at higher elevations. Territories did not overlap, and
   where they met, A. latinuchus was confined to slightly taller and more
   humid vegetation, or to forest. In interspecific encounters A.
   pallidiceps was subordinate to Stripe-headed Brush-finch Buarremon
   torquatus, with which it coexisted in all its territories. Habitat
   management began in 2002, and limited cowbird control is planned to
   begin in 2003.}},

Abstract = {{Red-legged Cormorant Phalacrocorax gaimardi, considered Near Threatened,
   is one of the most conspicuous seabirds on the south Pacific coast,
   although its current status is unknown. During spring and summer of
   1998, 1999 and 2000 we surveyed Red-legged Cormorants along the Chilean
   coast. Survey portions of the coast were chosen based on published
   information, and discussions with local people. Nesting sites were
   distributed from Arica (18degrees30'S) to the Peninsula de Taitao
   (46degrees25'S). We found 40 breeding areas with at least 54 colonies,
   ranging from two to 964 nests. Colony size (as number of breeding birds)
   was larger in the south than in the north. Isolated pairs or small
   colonies were found in the northern and central part of Chile. The
   southern coast (X-th Region) held most colonies, including the largest
   one with approximately 1,000 breeding pairs, suggesting it is a critical
   area for the species. We estimated the Red-legged Cormorant population
   in Chile to be between 5,018 and 5,218 breeding pairs. The X-th Region
   holds approximately 80\% of the whole Chilean population. Factors
   affecting the breeding distribution of this bird in Chile include
   coastal development, nesting habitat availability and the occurrence of
   El Nino (ENSO) events. Human consumption may be important locally,
   mainly in the south. Chile holds more than 70\% of the world breeding
   population, estimated at fewer than 15,000 individuals. The Peruvian
   population has declined during recent decades, and the Argentinean
   population seems to be small and stable. Thus the Chilean coast,
   particularly the X-th Region, is a critical area for the conservation of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{The endemic Seychelles Scops-owl Otus insularis is a Critically
   Endangered restricted-range species currently recorded only from the
   montane forest of Mahe, the largest (152 km(2)) and highest (903 m)
   island in the granitic Seychelles. Limited research has been conducted
   on the species and, in particular, details of its breeding biology are
   poorly known. Behavioural observations were made on 12 pairs by the
   systematic monthly use of playback of conspecific calls, in conjunction
   with frequent non-playback territory visits from April 1999 to May 2001.
   A total of eight nests, including the first nest record, were found on
   three territories. All were in tree cavities (7-25 m high) and contained
   either a single egg or chick. This was consistent with additional
   observations of solitary fledglings (n = 11, from eight territories).
   Incubation lasted 3-4 weeks and the fledging period was 4-6 weeks (data
   from two nests). The timing of copulations, in conjunction with the
   detection of nests and fledglings, suggests that the scops-owl can breed
   throughout the year with peaks in nesting occurring around May and
   October. Sex roles during breeding were similar to those of other
   Strigidae owls: incubation was performed by the female; males
   courtship-fed the female prior to and during incubation, and the female
   and chick for the first 2 weeks post-hatching; and both parents fed
   older chicks and fledglings. Fledglings remained on territory for at
   least 3 months. Breeding success of study pairs was low: two of eight
   nests were successful and 11 fledglings (recorded from eight of 12 study
   territories) were observed in a 26-month period, equivalent to c. 0.5
   fledglings per territory per year. Evidence suggests that alien
   predators may have been a factor limiting breeding success. We discuss
   the conservation implications of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{-headed Fruit-dove Ptilinopus porphyreus is a little-known,
   restricted-range species, endemic to the mountains of the Indonesian
   islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali. In the period 1981-2002 we conducted
   surveys throughout its range and compiled data on its presence and
   absence on 32 isolated mountain complexes. The fruit-dove appeared to be
   restricted to < 12,000 km(2) of forest, scattered over 20 major mountain
   complexes on the three islands, i.e. three on Sumatra, 1.6 on Java and
   one on Bali. It occurred exclusively on mountains Of > 2,000 In in
   altitude, where, depending on the size of the mountain, it reached its
   lower altitudinal limit between 500 and 1,000 m. The species was found
   mostly in singles or as pairs but occasionally in flocks of up to 17
   individuals. It occurred almost exclusively in forest, feeding on figs
   and small berries in the upper-canopy. We documented three cases of
   breeding in the wild. From captive birds it is known that a single egg
   is laid which is incubated for 20 days, with fledging occurring after
   another 15-16 days. Based on a study of 104 skins, the breeding season
   peak in West Java is at the beginning of the dry season. Although
   Pink-headed Fruit-dove is found in scattered, ever-shrinking forest
   blocks of mostly < 200 km(2), the scarcity of recent field records is
   more than likely due to its inconspicuous behaviour, and a threatened
   status is unwarranted as yet.}},

   wintering in the Cholistan Desert, Pakistan in 1998 were monitored using
   satellite transmitters. Their homeward migration began between 15 and 31
   March, and they arrived on breeding grounds in China, Mongolia and
   Uzbekistan between 16 and 27 May. The houbara stayed on their breeding
   areas for c. 135 days (range = 124-140). They arrived on the wintering
   grounds in the Cholistan Desert between 20 October and 15 December.
   During their migration, they avoided the mountain massifs of Hindu Kush,
   Pamir, Tien Shan and Himalaya. They could fly Up to 220 km day(-1) and
   covered a total distance of up to 4,400 km between their departure and
   destination points. Long stopovers were made mainly in the Registan
   Desert (Afghanistan), the Kyzylkum Desert (Uzbekistan/Kazakhstan), the
   Muyunkum and Taukum Deserts (Kazakhstan) and to a lesser extent the Zhob
   Valley (Pakistan). Conservation issues of a long-distance migrant
   species like Asian Houbara should be addressed at a broader scale

Abstract = {{Kulal White-eye Zosterops kulalensis is endemic to Mt Kulal, northern
   Kenya. It is currently considered a Vulnerable species because of its
   restricted range. We investigated its habitat and microhabitat use, and
   flocking and foraging behaviour, with respect to seasonal and diurnal
   variation. In the dry season, Kulal White-eye was encountered only in
   montane forest, where it was more abundant in glades than in
   closed-canopy habitats. Here it fed frequently on fruit, as most
   fruiting occurred in the drier months. In the wet season population
   density was also higher in glades than in closed-canopy forest, but
   birds were mostly insectivorous. Foraging in bush outside the forest was
   favoured. In the wet season, Kulal White-eye inhabited both the forest
   and the drier bush at lower altitudes, and avoided habitats with mature
   trees, preferring young tree formations where vegetation was thicker.
   Flock size was larger in the dry season, and, in the wet season, larger
   flocks were encountered in the morning and in late afternoon. Our study
   suggests that Kulal White-eye is less restricted to mature forest than
   previously thought. The conservation of the species requires that both
   the forest and the adjoining bush habitats receive adequate protection.
   Although some traditional human activities could be compatible with
   conservation, grazing of domestic animals inside the forest and the
   removal of large tracts of bush to create new pastures could be
   detrimental to the species.}},

Abstract = {{The Eastern Arc Mountains of East Africa are known for an exceptionally
   rich flora and fauna with very high endemism. For the conservation of
   rare forest birds these mountains are of the utmost importance in
   Africa. We provide the first population estimate of the endemic
   Loveridge's Sunbird Nectarinia loveridgei in the Uluguru Mountains of
   eastern Tanzania. Our study was conducted between September and December
   2000. Capture-recapture using mistnets was used to gather data at eleven
   study sites between 1,300-2,600 m altitude in four different areas of
   the Ulugurus. The program CAPTURE was used to estimate the population at
   each study site. Since the home range of Loveridge's Sunbird is unknown,
   the density of the potential population was calculated by assuming home
   ranges ranging from o km(2) through to 3 km(2). When combined with data
   on the forest area in the Ulugurus and fixing the lower and upper home
   range sizes for this species at 0.1 km(2) and 0.8 km(2), we obtain an
   estimated total population ranging from 21,000 to 166,000 individuals. A
   median home range of 0.45 km(2) estimates the population close to 37,000
   individuals. The species does not seem threatened but its long-term
   survival will depend on the survival of the forest, and in particular on
   how well the forest reserves on the Ulugurus are managed in the future.}},

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{33-41}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Between 1989 and 1999, the Spanish population of Griffon Vulture Gyps
   fulvus increased from 8,064 to 22,455 breeding pairs. This increase was
   not linked to any clear density-dependent process of population control
   given that the population grew more steadily in the more densely
   occupied sectors. This growth was related to a small increase in the
   breeding range of the species supporting the strong effect of the
   availability of nesting sites in limiting the range of the species.
   Around 85\% of the breeding pairs were restricted to limestone sectors
   where cliffs suitable for breeding colonies were more abundant. In these
   limestone sectors, changes in the number of breeding pairs were
   positively correlated to changes in livestock abundance during
   1989-1999, supporting a functional relationship between food
   availability and vulture abundance. Any active destruction of livestock
   carcasses to prevent the spread of some epidemic livestock diseases
   (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever, foot and
   mouth disease) will probably produce a concomitant reduction of the
   Spanish population of Griffon Vulture.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of China's Galliformes live in forests and it is often
   difficult to assess populations of species in these habitats. Such
   assessments are becoming increasingly important because much of China's
   forest has been altered through logging and other forms of human
   activity. After describing and mapping habitat types, we assessed two
   commonly used methods for counting pheasants (transects and point counts
   at dawn) in the Xianshennongjia Mountains in the Three Gorges area of
   Hubei Province in east-central China. Four pheasant species were
   recorded: Golden Pheasant Chwrysolophus pictus, Temminck's Tragopan
   Tragopan teimincki, Koklass Pucrasia macrolopha and Common (or
   Ring-necked) Pheasant Phasianus colchicus. Golden Pheasants were
   detected most often by calls heard during transects and Koklass were
   recorded mostly during point counts at dawn. Temminck's Tragopan was
   detected during transects (by sightings) and also by calls at dawn. The
   relatively few Common Pheasants that were detected were registered
   mainly during transects. Golden Pheasants were found at the lowest
   altitudes, closest to human habitation and both Temminck's Tragopan and
   Koklass lived in various forest types above this. Common Pheasant was
   found in meadows at higher altitudes. We conclude that the methods used
   can determine general habitat use, but that no one method is likely to
   prove sufficient to unravel the detailed pattern of habitat use across
   all four species. In particular, further study is required to assess the
   relative importance of different forest types to Golden Pheasant,
   Temminck's Tragopan and Koklass. It would appear that human impact on
   the forest has affected the distribution of the pheasant species. For
   example, Common Pheasant is now absent from low-lying areas and occurs
   at what appears to be an unusually high altitude in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{We used artificial social stimulation (decoys, vocalization playbacks,
   and artificial nests) to initiate group displays in six (two females,
   four males) Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ruber that had not
   successfully bred since their introduction to Guana Island, British
   Virgin Islands, in 1992. During a control period prior to the
   introduction of stimuli, flamingos exhibited no social displays or nest
   building activities. All flamingos were observed approaching the decoy
   area as a flock within four hrs of the decoys being introduced, and
   Head-Flagging displays were exhibited by two birds within the first 24
   hrs. In a 12-hr watch conducted two-weeks post decoy introduction, there
   were significantly more group display behaviours, as well as
   nest-building, as compared with the control period and immediately after
   the introduction (3.6\% as compared with 0\% and 0.35\%). Two
   individuals performed the majority of group displays (although at least
   one social display posture was observed for each bird) and three birds
   exhibited nest-building behaviour. Overall, individuals spent most of
   their time feeding and resting/sleeping (> 95\%) during all observation
   periods. We show for the first time that decoys and vocalization
   playbacks could have a positive impact on breeding success in the wild
   by inducing group displays and nesting behaviours in this group of
   introduced flamingos. We suggest that social attraction techniques may
   be a useful tool to stimulate breeding in small captive and wild small
   populations of flamingos.}},

Abstract = {{The incidental mortality of albatrosses Diomedeidae and petrels
   Procellariidae by longline fishing vessels, has been assessed and
   analysed in several areas of the globe. We provide the first direct
   estimates of incidental mortality rates of albatrosses and petrels along
   the Argentine Shelf and shelf break. The estimated by-catch rate for the
   whole period analysed (1999-2001) was 0.04 birds/1,000 hooks, with a
   maximum of 0.20 birds/1,000 hooks observed in 1999. Annual captures
   averaged 1,160 birds; however, the large variation observed indicates
   that annual by-catch may be in the order of thousands, with around
   10,000 seabirds being killed by longliners through the study period.
   Most of the captures were observed along the Patagonian shelf break. At
   least 12 bird species were incidentally taken, with Black-browed
   Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris and White-chinned Petrels
   Procellaria aequinoctialis accounting for about 80\% of total captures.
   The information provided in this study allowed the design and future
   implementation of mitigation measures and new survey methods onboard
   longliners operating in Atlantic waters on the Argentine shelf.}},

Abstract = {{The density and species richness of bird communities in disturbed and
   undisturbed stands of papyrus Cyperus papyius were compared. Point
   counts, corrected for different probabilities of detection in different
   swamps, suggested that the species richness of bird communities in
   stands of papyrus disturbed by burning, grazing or pollution was higher
   than in nearby stands that were not disturbed. However, there were fewer
   species and individuals of highly specialized birds or species
   characteristic of papyrus, in disturbed stands than in undisturbed
   swamps. At < 1 ha(-1), the density of Papyrus Gonolek Laniarius
   mufumbiri in Ugandan swamps was, for example, significantly lower in
   polluted and burnt sites than in undisturbed papyrus where up to 13
   ha(-1) were recorded in the centre of swamps. White-winged Swamp Warbler
   Bradypterus carpalis was only recorded in undisturbed papyrus. In the
   papyrus that fringes Lake Naivasha in Kenya, outside the geographical
   range of species restricted to papyrus, disturbance in the form of
   grazing selects against species classified as swam 9, p-reliant. Species
   classified as generalist users of papyrus were much less sensitive to
   disturbance than specialists. The density of swamp specialists was also
   lower near the edge of swamps, where total species richness was higher.
   These results are discussed in relation to conservation management of
   papyrus swamps in East Africa.}},

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{299-306}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Translocations of threatened species play an increasingly important role
   in conservation management. However, few studies have examined what
   effects, if any, the translocation process itself (i.e. catching,
   handling, confining, transferring and releasing an animal into an
   unfamiliar environment) has on subsequent breeding success. Takahe
   Porphyrio hoclistetteri living on offshore ``predator-free{''} islands
   in New Zealand are a model system for examining such effects because
   pre-breeding birds have been frequently translocated between established
   island populations before they pair up and breed at 2-3 years of age. We
   postulated that ``translocated{''} breeders (i.e. breeders that had been
   raised on another island) would delay first breeding attempts and/or
   have lower reproductive success compared with ``resident{''} birds (i.e.
   bred on the same island that they were raised). The results indicated
   that translocated birds did not delay breeding and had similar mean
   hatching and fledging success as resident pairs in their first breeding
   season and subsequent seasons combined. The results suggest that at
   least for large or long-lived birds such as Takahe, the effects of any
   stress from the translocation itself, or the release into an unfamiliar
   environment, might be either short-lived or not significant enough to
   hinder subsequent breeding success. We recommend that further research
   be carried out on other species to determine the baseline effects, if
   any, of translocations, so that they can be taken into account when
   considering other determinants of translocation success such as habitat
   suitability, number of individuals and timing of releases.}},

Abstract = {{The 10 km(2) island of La Digue, Republic of Seychelles, western Indian
   Ocean supports the last viable population of the Critically Endangered
   Seychelles Black Paradise-flycatcher Terpsiphone corvina. Small
   populations recorded on adjacent islands since the 1980s appear to be
   ephemeral and not self-sustaining. We document the results of the first
   island-wide survey of the flycatcher on La Digue using the playback of
   conspecific calls at random points. Previous surveys were based largely
   on counting the number of singing males. The survey was conducted
   between April and August 2001 and confirmed (i) the current world
   population is at least 200 individuals (109-145 territories, 218-290
   individuals) in a c. 4.4 km(2) range, thus accurately quantifying the
   documented increase in flycatcher numbers since the late 1970s; (ii)
   territories were more widely distributed than previously recorded and
   not exclusively associated with coastal plateaux or freshwater bodies,
   contrary to previous descriptions; and (iii) distribution was determined
   largely by the presence of high canopy (native) broad-leaved tree
   species. The importance of canopy height to flycatchers was highlighted
   by the fact that localized loss of high canopy (native) forest (4\%), in
   a 161 ha study area on the large western plateau, resulted in an
   equivalent reduction (4\%) in the number of territories. In light of our
   findings we discuss the implications for conservation of the flycatcher
   on La Digue and its possible translocation.}},

Abstract = {{Pilon Lajas Biosphere Reserve and Communal Lands (Pilon Lajas) ranges
   from 300 m to 1,400 m altitude in the departments of Beni and La Paz,
   Bolivia. It is located in the Bolivian and Peruvian lower yungas Endemic
   Bird Area (054) and within one of the regions of highest conservation
   priority in the Neotropics. Pilon Lajas includes primary evergreen
   tropical lowland forest, foothill forest, and lower montane forest.
   Vegetation heterogeneity forms the basis for the high species richness
   of the area. A population of approximately 600 Chiman, Moseten and
   Tacana indigenous people live within the reserve. Little has been
   published regarding the avifauna of Pilon Lajas. Here we present the
   results of visual observations and tape recordings of 22 ornithological
   surveys, recording 502 bird species. Serrania Pilon is the most
   intensively studied and species-rich mountain range with 332 species, 48
   of which have been recorded only in this area within Pilon Lajas. We
   present 26 new departmental records and evidence of breeding for 42
   species. The reserve protects three globally Vulnerable and three
   globally Near Threatened species, four species of High Conservation
   Priority and 32 of Medium Conservation Priority. Together with Madidi
   National Park and the adjacent Bahuaja Sonene National Park in
   south-eastern Peru, Pilon Lajas forms a unique protected area system of
   more than 3.5 million ha and plays an important role in the
   establishment of biological corridors along the eastern Andean slope in
   Bolivia.}},

Abstract = {{Long-wattled Umbrellabirds Cephalopterus pendiliger are restricted to
   the Choco Biogeographical Region, an area with exceptional levels of
   avian diversity and endemism. Due to widespread habitat loss and hunting
   pressure, the species is considered globally Vulnerable and Endangered
   within Ecuador. Little is known of the species' basic biology. This
   paper presents data on the first confirmed nest recorded for the
   species. The nest was found in June 2002 atop a tree fern Cyathea sp.
   located in secondary forest near Mindo, north-west Ecuador, at 1,600 m
   in the subtropical zone of the Andean slope. Data collected during
   incubation and nestling provisioning suggest that females may be
   responsible for all parental care. At the nest, the female provided food
   an average of once per hour, and brought roughly twice as many
   invertebrate food items as vertebrate or regurgitated food items. A male
   was never seen at the nest. In addition to presenting data from the
   nest, we compare Long-wattled Umbrellabirds to congeners and discuss
   implications for the conservation of this species.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the abundance and distribution of low-elevation forest
   birds on windward Hawai'i Island during August 1993-February 1994, and
   present evidence of changes in the species composition of the forest
   bird community since 1979. Endemic Hawaiian birds occurred in
   native-dominated forests as low as 120 m elevation. Non-native species
   were detected at all survey locations. We observed non-native Saffron
   Finch Sicalis flaveola, previously unrecorded in Puna. Variable circular
   plot surveys of Kahauale'a Natural Area Reserve indicated the
   disappearance of two native species ('I'iwi Vestiaria coccinea and `O'u
   Psittitostra psittacea), and two non-native additions (Red-billed
   Leiothrix Leiothrix lutea and Kalij Pheasant Lophura leucomelana) to the
   study area since the Hawai'i Forest Bird Survey conducted in 1979. We
   present evidence that native `Elepaio Chasiempsis sandwichensis has
   experienced a decrease in population density and an elevational range
   contraction since 1979. Surveys indicate Puna's forest bird community
   has had increasing aliens and declining native species since 1979. The
   persistence of some native bird species within the range of avian
   disease vectors such as Culex quinquefasciatus in forests below 1,000 m
   elevation presents an important enigma that requires additional study.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance patterns of Malabar Grey Hornbill
   Ocyceros griseus and Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis were studied in one
   undisturbed and one heavily altered rainforest landscape in the southern
   Western Ghats, India. The Agasthyamalai hills (Kalakad-Mundanthurai
   Tiger Reserve, KMTR) contained over 400 km(2) of continuous rainforest,
   whereas the Anamalai hills (now Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, IGWS)
   contained fragments of rainforest in a matrix of tea and coffee
   plantations. A comparison of point-count and line transect census
   techniques for Malabar Grey Hornbill at one site indicated much higher
   density estimates in point-counts (118.4/km(2)) than in line transects
   (51.5/km(2)), probably due to cumulative count over time in the former
   technique. Although line transects appeared more suitable for long-term
   monitoring of hornbill populations, point-counts may be useful for
   large-scale surveys, especially where forests are fragmented and terrain
   is unsuitable for line transects. A standard fixed radius point-count
   method was used to sample different altitude zones (600-1,500 m) in the
   undisturbed site (342 point-counts) and fragments ranging in size from
   0.5 to 2,500 ha in the Anamalais (389 point-counts). In the fragmented
   landscape, Malabar Grey Hornbill was found in higher altitudes than in
   KMTR, extending to nearly all the disturbed fragments at mid-elevations
   (1,000-1,200 m). Great Hornbill persisted in the fragmented landscape
   using all three large fragments (> 200 ha). It was also recorded in four
   of five medium-sized fragments (25-200 ha) and one of five small
   fragments (< 25 ha), which was adjacent to shade coffee plantations.
   Abundance of Malabar Grey Hornbill declined with altitude and increased
   with food-tree species richness. Great Hornbill abundance increased with
   food-tree species richness, suggesting that maintenance of high
   diversity of hornbill food species in fragments is important for their
   persistence. It is likely that the smaller and less specialized Malabar
   Grey Hornbill will survive in disturbed and fragmented forest
   landscapes, while Great Hornbill is more vulnerable to habitat
   alteration. Protection and restoration of rainforest fragments and
   food-tree resources, besides protection of existing large fragments,
   will aid the conservation of hornbills in the region.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we demonstrate that non-breeding adult Lesser
   White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus from the Fennoscandian breeding
   population may undertake long-distance moult migration eastwards. Of
   three individuals equipped with satellite transmitters at a spring
   staging site in northern Norway, two migrated to moulting sites in the
   area of Kolgujev Island and Kanin Peninsula, while the third headed
   towards the Taimyr Peninsula, all in northern Russia. The first leg of
   the moult migration route for non-breeders was between Finnmark, Norway
   and the Kanin Peninsula area in north-western Russia, a similar route to
   that taken on autumn migration by Fennoscandian Lesser White-fronted
   Geese that had bred successfully. After the moulting period, one of the
   individuals followed a south-western route to Poland and Germany, where
   it spent the first part of the winter. The satellite signals from the
   other two geese ceased abruptly in early autumn, indicating that the
   birds may have been illegally shot in Russia. Locating new moulting and
   migration stopover sites is of crucial importance for the conservation
   of the critically endangered Fermoscandian subpopulation of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The Chimalapas region, in eastern Oaxaca, Mexico, holds lowland
   rainforests, tropical dry forests, and cloud forests typical of the
   Neotropics, as well as montane pine and pine-oak forests more typical of
   the Nearctic. Totaling more than 600,000 ha, much of the region is
   forested, and in a good state of preservation. The Chimalapas avifauna
   is by far the most diverse for any region of comparable size in the
   country, totalling at least 464 species in the region as a whole (with
   more than 300 species in the lowland rainforest) representing 44\% of
   the bird species known from Mexico. Within the region, the humid
   Atlantic lowlands hold 317 species, the montane regions 113 species, and
   the southern dry forested lowlands 216 species. Important species
   present in the region include Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja and several
   other large eagles, Black Penelopina nigra and probably Horned
   Oreophasis derbianus Guans, Scarlet Macaw Ara macao, Cinnamon-tailed
   Sparrow Aimophila sumichrasti, Rose-bellied Bunting Passerina rositae,
   and Resplendent Quetzal Pharomachrus mocinno. The area holds immense
   lowland rainforests and cloud forests that rank among the largest and
   best preserved in all of Mesoamerica, including a complete
   lowland-to-highland continuum, with entire watersheds preserved more or
   less intact.}},

Abstract = {{The Kilum-Ijim forest is an excellent example of the ornithological
   riches of the Cameroon montane forest biome. The forest is also
   important to over 200,000 people who exert enormous pressure on the
   ecosystem. In 1995, the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project began systematic
   monitoring of birds, with the intention of using them as indicators of
   the overall condition of the forest, as well as monitoring the status of
   individual species. Analyses of data collected in 1999-2000 demonstrated
   some clear differences in habitat use, suggesting suites of bird species
   may be indicators of changes in vegetation. However, beyond this, little
   is known about the response of birds to habitat modifications, or the
   relationship between bird abundance and diversity of other organisms at
   Kilum-Ijim. It is argued that the objective of assessing changes in
   vegetation could be more satisfactorily pursued through direct
   measurement of structural changes in habitats. We highlight the
   necessity for a shift in the programme objectives to place greater
   emphasis on monitoring endemic and threatened bird species for their own
   status and on assessing changes in the bird community as a function of
   changes in the vegetation.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{79-95}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews and updates the distribution and status of two
   geographically distinct subspecies of New Zealand Saddleback
   Philesturnus carunculatus, a New Zealand forest passerine that is highly
   susceptible to predation by introduced mammals such as stoats and rats.
   The recovery of the North Island and South Island saddleback populations
   has been rapid since translocations to offshore islands free of exotic
   predators began in 1964, when both subspecies were on the brink of
   extinction. South Island saddlebacks have gone from a remnant population
   Of 36 birds on one island to over 1,200 birds spread among 15 island
   populations, with the present capacity to increase to a maximum Of 2,500
   birds. We recommend that South Island saddleback be listed under the
   IUCN category of Near Threatened, although vigilance on islands for
   invading predators and their subsequent rapid eradication is still
   required. North Island saddlebacks have gone from a remnant population
   Of 500 birds on one island to over 6,000 on 12 islands with the capacity
   to increase to over 19,000 individuals. We recommend that this
   subspecies be downgraded to the IUCN category of Least Concern. The
   factors that limited the early recovery of saddlebacks are now of less
   significance with recent advances in predator eradication techniques
   allowing translocations to large islands that were formerly unsuitable.
   The only two predators that still cohabit some islands with saddleback
   are Pacific rats or kiore Rattus exulans and Weka Gallirallus australis,
   a flightless native rail. Although North Island saddlebacks coexist with
   kiore, South Island saddlebacks do less well in their presence, possibly
   because the relict population had no previous history with this species
   of rat. The impact of Weka as predators of saddlebacks is less clear,
   but population growth rates appear to be slowed in their presence. It is
   recommended that while current recovery strategies involving island
   habitat restoration and translocations be maintained, management effort
   should also be directed towards returning saddlebacks to selected,
   ``mainland island{''} sites, where introduced pests are either excluded
   by predator-proof fences or controlled at very low levels by intensive
   pest management.}},

Abstract = {{Seychelles Black Paradise-flycatcher Terpsiphone corvina is found almost
   exclusively on the 10 km(2) island of La Digue. It is currently
   considered the second rarest endemic bird in the Seychelles, using the
   criteria of total population and number of discrete populations.
   Research reassessing the habitat requirements of the flycatcher was
   conducted on La Digue from 1999 to 2001. This work was conducted in
   parallel with assessment and ranking of the suitability of medium-sized
   islands of the inner Seychelles archipelago for avian ecosystem
   restoration, using biological, geographical and anthropogenic criteria.
   Predator eradications on several islands have led to a reduction in the
   range of alien predators, and future eradications are planned. These
   developments combined with the findings of recent ecological research
   and a novel assessment of many islands in the archipelago have led to
   the opportunity for a reassessment of conservation options for
   Seychelles Black Paradise-flycatcher. This paper discusses and
   prioritizes strategies to increase the range and total population and
   hence improve the conservation status of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Alagoas Curassow Mitu mitu is considered extinct in the wild, having
   previously inhabited a small area in north-eastern Brazil that has since
   been replaced by sugar cane farms. Around 50 birds possessing
   morphological features of this species are still alive in captivity in
   Brazil, all being descendants from a breeding programme started in 1979,
   using offspring from a single male and two females captured from the
   wild. However, this captive population also includes some hybrids with
   the congeneric Razor-billed Curassow M. tuberosa and their descendants.
   Furthermore, the validity of Alagoas Curassow as a species is
   questionable. We used two molecular markers to study the validity of
   this taxon as a species, to detect potential hybrids present in the
   stock, and to estimate genetic variability among the remnant specimens.
   The analysis Of 760 base pairs from mitochondrial cytochrome b and
   control region sequences revealed that at least three of the 20 birds
   analysed had sequences identical to those of Razor-billed Curassow. The
   other 17 birds presented sequences that diverged 2.6\% from Razor-billed
   Curassow. Moreover, a sample from an Alagoas Curassow museum skin
   collected from the wild in 1951 had cytochrome b sequences identical to
   those of the 17 birds. These results confirm the Alagoas Curassow as a
   valid species. DNA fingerprinting profiles of the 20 descendants from
   the Alagoas Curassow breeding population showed that this group of birds
   is depauperate in genetic variability. There was an increase in genetic
   variability of birds born after 1990, attributed to the hybrid mating of
   Alagoas Curassow with Razor-billed Curassow. We suggest that birds born
   before 1990 should be handled separately from the others. However, if a
   decrease in chick harvest among birds of this group is detected due to
   inbreeding depression or ageing, cross-breeding between this group and
   the group of birds most closely related to it should be considered in
   order to enrich the progeny with the Alagoas Curassow genome.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Swamp Francolin Francolinus gularis is considered Vulnerable to
   extinction as its native grassland habitat is converted to agricultural
   land. However, there are virtually no life history data available to
   allow the impact of these changes on the species to be assessed.
   Thirteen birds were radio-tracked during the breeding season on
   agricultural land near Dudwa National Park in Uttar Pradesh, northern
   India. The study area was dominated by sugar-cane fields, but also
   contained other crops and natural wet grassland. Home range size varied
   from 273 m(2) to 2,687 m(2) and was significantly correlated with
   tracking duration. We did not detect significant patterns in overall use
   of habitats at either the home-range level (P = 0.14) or at the
   radio-location level (P = 0.13). However, some individual habitats
   appeared to be used in proportions that differed from random
   expectations. At the home range level, birds appeared to favour tall
   sugar-cane and grassland whilst at the individual location level,
   grassland and wet areas were most used. Radio-tagged birds made six
   nests, of which only two hatched young. One was in an old sugar-cane
   field and the other on grassland. Although we did not detect statistical
   significance, we believe that developing an appropriate management
   regime for this species is so urgent that the results are sufficient to
   manage adaptively the species' habitat at least on an experimental
   scale. These data suggest that a matrix of habitats, including
   agricultural land, can supply the necessary components to satisfy the
   various requirements of Swamp Francolin. However, some natural grassland
   habitat associated with wet areas appears to be critical. The crucial
   challenge is to make sure that agricultural landscapes have these
   habitats present in the right proportions and spatial arrangements to
   support viable populations of Swamp Francolin.}},

   differences in body size. They nested at the bottom of deep cavities
   with a long entrance (mean 45 cm), in tall trees. Average nest height
   was 23 m. Nests were sometimes abandoned (10\% of nests) during
   nest-building or incubation. Most Hill Mynahs (70\%) had clutches of
   three eggs. Both parents shared incubation and feeding of young. The
   most detrimental factor to the reproductive success of this species was
   human theft of the young, rather than any natural factors. During 1991
   to 1998, 80\% of eggs laid were hatched, but 88\% of all eggs hatched
   were lost before fledgling. Those illegally stolen by humans amounted to
   61\% of eggs hatched. Only 37 Of 308 nestlings or 12\% of eggs hatched
   survived to independence. In 1999, nests were experimentally guarded to
   prevent human interference, and fledgling success increased to 75\% of
   eggs hatched. The remaining 25\% of nestlings were lost to predators and
   unknown causes, close to the 27\% lost to these causes in unguarded
   nests during 1991 to 1998. Although the breeding pattern of this species
   has evolved to promote survival of young, it does not seem to have
   evolved adaptations to human predation. The continuing decrease of wild
   Hill Mynah populations has prompted attempts at captive breeding. Data
   on breeding biology from this study should enhance its success.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmoledo Atoll, in the Aldabra Group, western Indian Ocean, has rarely
   been visited by scientists. This paper reports the first visit by
   ornithologists during the south-east monsoon when many seabirds breed.
   The breeding populations of three species of booby (Sula spp.) and of
   Sooty Tern Sterna fuscata were censused and all other species of bird
   seen were recorded. The atoll proved to have globally significant
   populations of Masked Booby Sula dactylatra of the subspecies melanops,
   Red-footed Booby S. sula of the subspecies rubripes, and Sooty Tern of
   the subspecies nubilosa. Cosmoledo also supports populations of
   landbirds that have forms endemic to the Aldabra group, but whose
   taxonomy requires examination using molecular techniques. The atoll,
   although currently uninhabited, suffers the impacts of exotic fauna and
   flora, including cats and rats, introduced by previous inhabitants. The
   isolation of Cosmoledo confers some protection, but its value as a
   centre of biodiversity, and designation as an Important Bird Area by
   BirdLife International, indicate that formal protection is needed.
   Political mechanisms for this are suggested, the implementation of which
   would help to procure funding to enable practical conservation of the
   atoll's biota.}},

Abstract = {{Hinde's Babbler Turdoides hindei is a globally threatened Kenyan
   endemic, which during the 1990s, was known from just seven localities.
   Based mainly on surveys undertaken in 2000-2001, we estimate the
   species's global population size and compare recent changes in its
   ``extent of occurrence{''} and ``area of occupancy{''}. Historically,
   Hinde's Babbler has been recorded from c. 40 x 10 km squares; 27
   pre-1980 and 19 subsequently, suggesting that its area of occupancy has
   declined by about 30\%. In contrast, its extent of occurrence has
   declined by only 8\%, this measure being less sensitive to the balance
   of gains and losses occurring near the centre of its range. During
   surveys in 1994 and 2000-2001, 157 groups were located, containing 665
   birds, 75\% of which were found at two intensively cultivated sites.
   Some 97\% of birds were located in, or adjacent to, five Important Bird
   Areas, but only 8\% were found within legally protected areas. Two
   extrapolated population estimates are presented, based on the number of
   birds likely to have been missed at survey sites, and the species' area
   of occupancy. These suggest that the global population of Hinde's
   Babbler is likely to fall within the range of 1,500-5,600 birds.}},

Abstract = {{In October 2001, the world population of Raso Lark Alauda razae,
   confined to the uninhabited, and islet of Raso in the Cape Verde
   Islands, was estimated at between 128 and 138 birds, of which 61-66\%
   were males. The biased sex ratio was confirmed by standardized
   observations of randomly selected birds. The male-dominated sex ratio
   may result from differences in bill morphology and feeding methods. The
   males spent much time digging for the bulbs of the nutsedge Cyperus
   bulbosus, whereas females were seen to dig far less frequently. These
   differences may have been due to significant sexual differences in bill
   size. Both sexes also took a range of invertebrate prey, particularly
   lepidopteran larvae. Unpaired males showed differences in behaviour to
   paired males, particularly with respect to song flight length.
   Measurement of museum skins suggested significant seasonal changes in
   bill size, possibly related to changes in diet or feeding methods. Bill
   sizes in both sexes were highly variable, but significantly more
   variable in males. Nest predation, almost certainly by a near-endemic
   gecko, was extremely high, Mayfield estimates suggesting a nest survival
   rate of less than 5\% between the onset of laying and the end of
   incubation. Cats and dogs were thought to be absent, although analysis
   of droppings shows that both have been present in the recent past.
   Analysis of,historical data shows a strong correlation between
   population size and rainfall, and numbers of birds have fallen to
   extremely low levels during droughts. The conservation of the species is
   discussed in the light of these findings.}},

   was close agreement between the distributions of finches predicted from
   the use of this technique and from field records of the birds. The data
   suggest that the ranges of two endemic subspecies, Royal Parrot Finch
   Erythrura cyanovirens regia and Blue-faced Parrot Finch Erythrura
   trichroa cyanofrons, have declined in recent years. Royal Parrot Finch,
   in particular, should be given high conservation priority. It now
   occupies a tiny global range and is believed to be particularly
   vulnerable to further habitat change.}},

Abstract = {{Bare-necked Umbrellabird Cephalopterus glabricollis is endemic to Costa
   Rica and western Panama. It eats fruit, breeding at high elevations
   (greater than or equal to 800 m) and migrating to lower elevations
   during the non-breeding season. Using data from transect counts and
   radio-telemetry, we monitored bird movements in a protected area
   (Monteverde-Arenal-San Ramon reserves) in the Tilaran Mountains, Costa
   Rica. We also monitored fruit abundance along an altitudinal gradient to
   explore the potential relationship between bird movements and the
   abundance of the fruits this species consumed. The presence and
   abundance of umbrellabirds at high elevations (1,400 m) during the
   breeding season (March-June) coincided with the highest peak of fruit
   abundance. The presence of umbrellabirds in the lowlands (400 m) during
   the non-breeding season overlapped with the period of highest fruit
   abundance at these elevations. At middle elevations, bird presence and
   abundance did not correlate with fruit abundance. Radio-tagged birds
   left the protected area during the non-breeding season and there were no
   umbrellabirds inside the protected area during this period. Habitats
   where this species bred were well represented in the protected area but
   the habitat where they spent the non-breeding season was poorly
   represented, and was not adequately protected. This represents a
   potential threat to this species in the Tilaran Mountains.}},

Abstract = {{Karakelang, largest of the Talaud Islands, Indonesia, was visited in
   1999 with the aim of producing population estimates of globally
   threatened and Restricted-range bird species. Density estimates were
   calculated from primary forest and secondary habitats using the variable
   circular plot method. Eight of the nine restricted-range or threatened
   species resident on Karakelang were recorded and density estimates
   calculated for five of these. Two species of rail are endemic to
   Karakelang, Talaud Bush-hen Amaurornis magnirostris and Talaud Rail
   Gymnocrex talaudensis. The bush-hen was encountered in secondary habitat
   but occurred at higher densities in primary forest and the estimated
   population was 2,350-9,560 birds. The less vocal, cryptic G. talaudensis
   was noted just twice, in primary forest close to rivers. Both have small
   populations, are threatened by habitat degradation, hunting, and
   possibly predation by introduced rats and should be classified as
   threatened. Population densities of the Endangered, endemic Red-and-blue
   Lory Eos histrio had remained stable since the last survey in 1997. They
   occurred at higher densities in primary forest, but were also common in
   human-made habitats. The estimated population was 8,230-21,400 birds,
   threatened by habitat loss and trapping for the wild bird trade.
   Although more commonly encountered in forest, the Near Threatened
   Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis was found at higher densities
   in secondary habitats, and the population was estimated at 8,130-20,700
   birds. The Restricted-range Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon D. concinna was
   very common on Karakelang (14,500-27,700 birds), whilst the Vulnerable
   Grey Imperial Pigeon D. pickeringii was recorded rarely; both species
   were more frequently recorded in primary forest. The endemic Talaud
   Kingfisher Halcyon enigma occurred at low densities (5,290-8,690 birds),
   in primary forest and adjacent disturbed areas. It is heavily dependent
   on primary forest and threatened by habitat loss, and should be
   classified as Vulnerable. Approximately 350 km(2) of primary forest on
   Karakelang is protected, 250 km(2) as a wildlife reserve. However, at
   present, management is absent and forest is threatened by agricultural
   encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Given that all endemic and
   threatened species were encountered more frequently or occurred at
   higher densities in primary forests, future conservation efforts should
   target these protected areas. Management of reserves should involve
   local stakeholders from government and representatives of island
   communities. Wildlife trade is a major threat to Eos histrio and strict
   enforcement of the species' protected status should include monitoring
   of roost sites, patrols of harbours and markets in Talaud, Sulawesi and
   the Philippines, and the control of Philippine fishing boats involved in
   the wild bird trade. Further species-specific research and monitoring is
   also required.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In view of the continuing appropriation and conversion of natural land
   areas in North America for human uses, there is growing concern about
   the impacts of changing land use on terrestrial bird species. In order
   to promote conservation of critical remaining habitats for birds,
   Partners in Flight (PIF) initiated a project in 1997 in which bird
   conservation plans were prepared by members in each of 60 ecologically
   defined physiographical areas throughout the United States. Accurate,
   nationwide information on the location and extent of vegetative cover
   types, as well as lands under state and federal management, are
   critically important elements in the creation of effective bird
   conservation plans. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)
   awarded a challenge grant to The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Wings of the
   Americas Program to assist Partners in Flight in acquiring land cover
   data to serve as the foundation of the planning effort. Canon U.S.A.,
   Inc. and the American Bird Conservancy also contributed support toward
   this goal. The Center for Advanced Spatial Technology at the University
   of Arkansas was contracted to produce the needed land cover maps and
   associated tabular products. Digital land cover databases created by the
   U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Canada Centre for
   Remote Sensing, the University of California-Santa Barbara Department of
   Geography, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of
   Transportation Statistics were used in this project. The final spatial
   products were produced during 1998-1999 and are described in this paper.
   This effort represents the first nationwide habitat mapping project in
   the United States aimed at supporting and enhancing conservation of
   terrestrial bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Oriental White-backed Vulture Gyps bengalensis and
   Long-billed Vulture G. indicus declined in India between the mid 1980s
   and late 1990s. Regional reports from India described declines Of
   95-100\% across a wide area. This study was conducted to investigate the
   breeding success and pattern of mortality in two vulture colonies
   (Dholewala and Changa Manga) within Punjab Province, Pakistan between
   December 2000 and June 2001. Breeding success was found to be 62\% in
   Dholewala and 59\% in Changa Manga. A total of 668 sick and dead
   vultures were collected of which 591 were less than one month post
   mortem. No significant variation was found in the weekly mortality rate
   of adult and subadult vultures during the study period spanning winter
   through summer. A peak in mortality rate was observed during late April
   and early May that corresponded to mortality of newly fledged juveniles.
   Minimum annual mortality rate in the adult breeding population was
   calculated to be 11.4\% and 18.6\% in Dholewala and Changa Manga
   respectively. In a subsample of dead vultures (n = 185) visceral gout
   was found in 80\% of adults, 63\% of subadults, 19\% of juveniles and
   13\% of nestlings. These mortality rates were consistent with a rapid
   population decline. Results imply that the mortality factor responsible
   for the decline in Gyps vultures described in India is also present in
   Pakistan and will potentially lead to a population decline of a
   comparable magnitude.}},

   extirpated, wintering at just two known sites, in Iran and India. To
   help conserve species that migrate long distances it is essential to
   have a comprehensive conservation plan that includes identification of
   migration routes and key resting areas. One Siberian Crane was
   satellite-tracked from the south Caspian Sea to its breeding grounds in
   Russia during the spring of 1996. The crane began migration on 6 March,
   and completed its migration on 1 May. This destination was formerly
   unknown as a breeding area for the species. During migration, the crane
   rested primarily at the eastern end of the Volga River delta. This
   suggests that the delta may be an important resting site for Siberian
   Crane.}},

Abstract = {{White-bellied Shortwing is a globally threatened species found in the
   Western Ghats of India. There have been few records of this species over
   the past 119 years and its population is thought to have fallen due to
   habitat loss and fragmentation. The present study was conducted to
   assess the habitat preferences and distribution of this species in the
   Western Ghats of Kerala and Tamilnadu states as a prelude to a long-term
   study on the biology and causes of decline of this species. Several
   areas across varying vegetation type and altitude were surveyed after an
   intensive reconnaissance. There were 214 sightings from evergreen and
   shola forests during the study. They were found to prefer shola forests
   to other vegetation types. The species was also found in pine, wattle
   and tea plantations near shola forests. Although it was found to prefer
   an altitude above 1,500 In, it was also found in shola forests between
   1,000 and 1,500 In elevations. White-bellied Shortwing was found to
   occupy an elevation range from 1,000 M to 2,200 m. Encounter rates in
   shola forests fragmented by human interference. were four times higher
   than those in natural shola forests. Most encounters of shortwings were
   near streams that were wet (running or damp). Emphasis is laid on the
   need for long-term studies to unravel the basic biology of the species
   in order to aid active conservation efforts.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The endemic Seychelles Scops-owl Otus insularis is a Critically
   Endangered restricted range species currently only recorded in the
   upland forest of Mahe, the largest (152 km(2)) and highest (903 m)
   island in the granitic Seychelles. We studied the response of
   colour-ringed individuals to playback of conspecific calls, to determine
   factors affecting playback reaction, to monitor behaviour and to assess
   the reliability of current monitoring techniques. Playback of the
   territorial waugh call was conducted at fixed points (C. 200 M apart)
   every month along a total transect length of 8.4 km between April 1999
   and May 2001. On the basis of responses and movements of marked
   individuals we identified 12 territories and noted their boundaries.
   Mean territory length was 2.92 points (approximately 400 m), equivalent
   to a conservative estimated territory size of c. 12-16 ha. Males were
   more frequently detected than females/pairs. The probability of
   detection (males vs. females/pairs) was 0.87 vs. 0.50 on territory; 0.65
   VS. 0.26 at fixed points within territories; and 0.58 VS. 0.22 at fixed
   points along the transect. There was some significant seasonal variation
   in detection rates at fixed points within territories for both males and
   pairs, and in general there was a low probability of detecting
   individuals around June-August and a high probability of detection
   around April and, to a lesser degree, October. Response times and
   owl-recorder distances were not influenced by moon phase or time of
   playback. This study provides the first baseline data on individual
   responses to the systematic repeated use of playback in Seychelles
   Scops-owl. We discuss the implications for current monitoring and its
   application to other similar Otus species.}},

Abstract = {{The islands of Wallacea were surveyed most intensely by field
   ornithologists in the nineteenth century, and again in the 1990s.
   However, the status and habitat use of bird species on many islands
   remains unknown. This study examined birds in several natural and
   disturbed habitats on Lembata (also known as Lomblen) Island, Indonesia.
   A total of 78 bird species were recorded including six endemic to the
   Lesser Sundas, an additional three Wallacean endemics and a total Of 27
   resident forest species. Including published records, 91 bird species
   have been recorded for Lembata. Extrapolation from the cumulative number
   of new species in the 45 samples gave an expected Total Bird Richness Of
   103.4 species. The frequency of occurrence of Lesser Sundas endemic bird
   species, all Wallacean endemics and Lesser Sundas endemic subspecies,
   forest-dependent species and frugivores was greatest in closed canopy
   forest (at higher elevations). Conversely, generalist
   ``Australo-Papuan{''} species, granivores and nectarivores occurred more
   frequently in lowlands (including human-modified habitats). Protected
   area proposals were made in 1982, but there has been no management of
   natural areas for biological conservation on Lembata. Conservation
   activities aiming to stem forest loss and fragmentation in an Important
   Bird Area in southern Lembata, which includes significant populations of
   the Flores Green Pigeon Treron floris (Globally Vulnerable), may be an
   important step. Merits of the ``Species list{''} survey method are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We developed distributional models for go threatened bird species in
   China, and used heuristic complementarity algorithms to prioritize areas
   for conservation. The pixel-based area selection prioritized 20 areas
   for protection, which covered all species analysed. Area selecting for
   endangered species based on the existing biosphere reserve system
   included only 37-62 species in eleven reserves, leaving 28-53 species
   unprotected. We employed algorithms for area selection based on species
   richness and rarity and obtained two views of a most efficient reserve
   network. We used the distributional hypotheses to identify additions to
   the reserve system that would improve its effectiveness substantially.
   The pixel-based area selection approach includes species much more
   efficiently on a per-area basis, and thus offers exciting perspectives
   for improved protection of the country's endangered avifauna.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The Endangered Rodrigues Warbler Acrocephalus rodericanus is endemic to
   the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues, one of the world's most devastated
   tropical islands, its native forest having been completely destroyed
   since human colonization three centuries ago. It is now found in
   thickets and woodland dominated entirely by non-native trees and shrubs.
   As a step to implementing conservation initiatives, a population census
   and habitat study was undertaken in April-June 1999.. Using a
   combination of tape playback of song and point counts, at least 103
   Rodrigues Warblers spread through nine wooded localities were observed,
   and a minimum population of 150 birds estimated. The majority (78\%) and
   highest densities (2.3/ha) were found in habitat dominated by one
   introduced invasive tree, the rose-apple Syzygium jambos. Warblers were
   also found in plantations dominated by mahogany Swietenia mahagoni,
   tecoma Tabebuia pallida and Norfolk Island pine Araucaria cunninghamii,
   but at much lower densities (0.5/ha). Warbler densities were highest in
   habitat with a dense structure of small branches. There was a strong
   positive relationship between one index of human disturbance (number of
   cut branches) and warbler densities. This low-intensity cutting may
   promote the growth of new shoots thus perpetuating the dense vegetation
   structure that Rodrigues Warbler favours. At two localities, one
   supporting an existing population of warblers and the other prone to
   extirpation (shown from previous surveys), vegetation structure and
   composition were similar between sites, hinting that in some currently
   unoccupied areas, habitat is probably suitable and other factors are
   operating to preclude colonization and establishment. Further ecological
   studies would be desirable, especially to investigate the effect of
   nest-predation by introduced mammals and other factors suppressing
   warbler population growth.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1995 and 2000, we made a comparative study of ranging patterns
   of individuals of five sympatric species of antpitta Grallaria spp. that
   differ in body size and extent of geographical range. Grallaria milleri
   is restricted to a small area in the central Andes of Colombia, G.
   rufocinerea is endemic to the Central Cordillera, and G. ruficapilla, G.
   nuchalis and G. squamigera are widely distributed in the tropical Andes.
   Using mist-nets, we captured and banded 76 individuals of the five
   species during the five year study period. We also radio-tracked six
   individuals for periods Of 30-60 days, to obtain estimates of territory
   sizes. Recapture patterns revealed that antpittas exhibited high site
   fidelity, remaining in the same patch for documented periods of up to 34
   months. However, some individuals were captured only once, and were
   probably transient through the area. Territory sizes estimated were
   0.5-5.4 ha for G. milleri (n = 7), 1.4 and 1.5 ha for G. rufocinerea (n
   = 2), 1.9 ha for G. ruficapilla (n = 1), 9.3 ha for G. nuchalis (n = 1)
   and 2 and 4.5 ha for G. squamigera (n = 2). We compared these data with
   territory estimates of other Neotropical Formicariids. Our results
   indicated that antpittas had relatively small territories, and had
   population densities higher than assumed previously for these secretive
   birds of the forest understorey.}},

Abstract = {{Saffron-cowled Blackbird Xanthopsar flavus is a globally threatened
   icterid of open areas of south-eastern South America. Several sources
   suggest that the species is declining throughout its range, mainly due
   to habitat destruction. Between December 1997 and December 1999 we
   studied a breeding population of X. flavus at the Banhado do
   Vinte-e-Cinco and Banhado da Mulata area, Rio Grande municipality, Rio
   Grande do Sul state, Brazil. This population, previously unreported for
   the state's coastal plain, numbers at least 60 individuals and seems
   confined to an area of c. 35 km(2). The area is characterized by
   Cyperacaea-dominated peat marshes in comparatively higher terrain,
   covered with sandy, rolling fields. The species was recorded in all
   months (not necessarily of the same year) except March, and a marked
   irregularity in flock size was detected. During the non-breeding period,
   flock size averaged 12.7 individuals (S.D. = 11.7; range = 2-37; n =
   11). During the 1997-1998 breeding season (December to January), mean
   flock size was 25.3 individuals (S.D. = 16.2; range = 16-60; n = 7),
   while in the 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 breeding seasons, 33 and 4
   individuals were recorded respectively. No pronounced discrepancy was
   found in the size of the largest flocks recorded per season (from 20 to
   37 individuals), suggesting that the population is sedentary and that it
   undertakes only local movements. A nesting colony occupying the same
   part of the marsh in two successive breeding seasons was composed of six
   breeding pairs in 1997-1998, with an estimated nesting success of
   31.8-36.3\% at fledgling time. The species is highly gregarious and
   sociable, foraging flocks frequently following individuals of
   Black-and-White Monjita Heteroxolmis dominicana and, to a lesser extent,
   Yellow-rumped Marshbird Pseudoleistes guirahuro and Brown-and-yellow
   Marshbird P. virescens. Although habitat loss has been indicated as the
   main factor for the species' decline, we suggest that habitat
   perturbation and modification may affect negatively recruitment rates in
   the species and, theoretically, its overall population size.
   Furthermore, the conservation of Rio Grande's peat marshes should be
   regarded a regional priority, in order to preserve threatened birds and
   a very unusual wetland type.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out a four-year (1995-1999) survey on the foraging and
   breeding distribution of Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus on the island
   of Crete. The age classes of all birds sighted were systematically
   recorded and data on seasonal distribution patterns were collected; 262
   observations were made covering an area of about 4,000 km(2), at
   altitudes ranging from 200 In to 2,450 m a.s.1 (mean 1,100 m). Adult
   birds were distributed evenly throughout the island while young birds
   avoided active territories and were mostly sighted at the periphery of
   the high mountains. The species depended almost entirely on domestic
   livestock herded into and away from the mountains seasonally, with birds
   foraging in the uplands (> 1,200 m a.s.1.) from early May to late
   October and frequenting midland pastures (600-1,200 m a.s.1.) for the
   rest of the year. The mean altitude of nesting sites was 750 m (range =
   280-1,450 m), with 80\% of nests positioned below the 1,000 m contour.
   Bearded Vultures are more vulnerable to human-induced mortality within
   their breeding territories and on midland pastures in winter than in the
   upland areas in summer.}},

Abstract = {{Upon its adoption in 1992, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
   was greeted with enthusiasm by the conservation community including bird
   conservationists. Nine years after its entry into force in 1993, the CBD
   still has to live up to the original high expectations if it is to halt,
   or even slow, the loss of biodiversity at the ecosystem, species and
   genetic level. Among the reasons for this shortcoming, the rather vague
   nature of obligations for the 182 governments who have ratified the
   Convention is probably the most important, National Biodiversity
   Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) form the most significant
   instrument for the implementation of the CBD. The Global Environment
   Facility (GEF) is supporting the NBSAPs financially, as well as local,
   national and regional projects, many of which are relevant for bird
   conservation. Being the best-researched animal taxa, birds could serve
   relatively easily as indicators for the success of efforts under the
   Convention. Some cases, where ornithological data are being used within
   NBSAPs and related processes, are highlighted. From the early stages of
   planning, bird surveyors should take the potential use of their results
   by decision-makers into account. For ensuring that survey data are fed
   into NBSAPs and other similar policy documents, a strong collaboration
   of ornithologists and birdwatchers with non-governmental conservation
   organizations is recommended.}},

Title = {{Land-use and the conservation of Sharpe's Longclaw Macronyx sharpei in
   central Kenya}},
Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{107-121}},

Abstract = {{The highland grasslands of central Kenya hold a suite of
   restricted-range bird species, including several of global conservation
   concern. These grasslands occur almost entirely on private land with no
   formal protection, and have received little conservation attention. This
   paper describes land-use change on the Kinangop Plateau, Kenya, and
   considers the implications for grassland bird species, especially
   Sharpe's Longclaw Macronyx sharpei. The Kinangop Plateau is an area of
   montane grassland east of the Rift Valley, used primarily for dairy
   farming since human settlement in 1964. However, dairy farming (which
   retains grassland as pasture) has given way to other forms of land-use,
   especially cultivation of crops. In March 1996, a questionnaire was
   administered to 50 landowners to investigate community attitudes towards
   birds and their conservation, the extent of present land-use changes and
   likely future land-use patterns, The mean acreage of landholding was
   decreasing, and more grassland was rapidly being converted into
   cultivated land, with 3.2\% being ploughed up during the six months from
   November 1995 to May 1996. Farmers expressed a preference for crop
   farming (66\%) over livestock farming (26\%) or other land uses.
   Thirty-two per cent expressed a positive attitude, and 60\% were
   indifferent, towards birds. Most (76\%) were not aware of biodiversity
   values or conservation. Though 64\% were aware of declining bird
   populations around them, 82\% of this group did not realize that their
   activities might be contributing to this decline. Sixty-eight per cent
   of landowners planned to convert all or part of their grassland
   holdings. Although landowners' interests seemed generally incompatible
   with grassland conservation, a substantial proportion (44\%) were
   prepared to consider opportunities to enhance the area's conservation
   value. An informal follow-up survey in March 1999 concluded that
   prospects for the dairy industry and for grassland habitats on Kinangop
   were not as bleak as the initial survey suggested, but confirmed the
   delicate conservation status of Sharpe's Longclaw and its habitat. We
   suggest a variety of actions that might help to secure the future of
   Sharpe's Longclaw while promoting sustainable agricultural development
   on Kinangop, and propose several topics where further research is
   needed. Species such as Sharpe's Longclaw will only survive if we can
   develop ways of managing their habitats in a manner that is consistent,
   rather than in conflict, with the needs of the agricultural community.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Santa Catarina lies in the Atlantic Forest Domain of
   southern Brazil, one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet, It
   holds a wide variety of habitats, ranging from sand dune `restingas' to
   mature rain forest. We report, for the first time, a survey of the bird
   species and their conservation status for the different habitats present
   on the island. We recorded 269 bird species of 54 families (25 species
   were seabirds). More than 50\% (140) of the total number of species were
   residents or probable residents, 20\% (58) were visitors and a
   relatively high number of species (61, 23\%) had indeterminate
   residential status. Nearly 15\% (35 species) of the 244 landbird species
   observed were endemic to the Atlantic Forest. Habitat specificity was
   recorded for 40\% (97 species). We recorded one Endangered (Solitary
   Tinamou Tinamus solitarius), one Vulnerable (White-necked Hawk
   Leucopternis lacernulata), and three Near-threatened species (Azure Jay
   Cyanocorax caeruleus, Azure-shouldered Tanager Thraupis cyanoptera,
   Black-backed Tanager Tangara peruviana). We also recorded six locally
   threatened species that we predict will become extinct in the near
   future. The future for the birds of the island is uncertain, especially
   for habitat specialists, due to habitat loss for resort developments,
   and a lack of concern by the government and local people.}},

Abstract = {{A high proportion of island birds are threatened with extinction as a
   result of their vulnerability to introduced predators, habitat
   destruction, and fragmentation/isolation effects. In order to conserve
   island species effectively, it is necessary to disentangle these effects
   on distribution and abundance. We attempt to do this for the nine native
   passerines in the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands, using a database of
   presence/absence on 59 offshore islands in the archipelago, linked to
   data for each island on mammal presence, habitat modification, and
   isolation, Falklands native passerines are of considerable conservation
   importance, comprising one endemic globally threatened species, several
   endemic subspecies, and several restricted range species. presence of
   rats on islands was by far the most important predictor of passerine
   presence, overriding the effect of habitat modifications. The globally
   threatened endemic Cobb's Wren Troglodytes cobbi was absent from all
   islands containing rats. Some species were more likely, and others less
   likely to occur on islands where tussac Poa flabellata grassland had
   been destroyed by grazing. The former species were Primarily those
   adapted to dwarf-heath vegetation, and/or that thrive around human
   settlements. Island size and isolation were important predictors of
   occurrence for several bird species. The analyses show that, if
   vegetation restoration in the Falklands is to meet conservation aims,
   then it should be accompanied by introduced mammal control. Secondly,
   they indicate that biogeographical effects on bird distribution among
   islands in the Falklands are important, and need to be considered when
   assessing the conservation status of species, and when considering
   conservation action.}},

Title = {{Species limits within Grey-headed Quail-dove Geotrygon caniceps and
   implications for the conservation of a globally threatened species}},
Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{169-187}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Grey-headed Quail-dove Geotrygon caniceps has traditionally been
   considered a polytypic species endemic to Cuba and the Dominican
   Republic and treated as globally threatened within the most recent Red
   Data Book (BirdLife International 2000). Chapman (1917) described
   Geotrygon leucometopius of Hispaniola as specifically distinct from G.
   caniceps of Cuba based on 10 specimens, taken by Rollo Beck in the
   Dominican Republic. Subsequently, Bond (1936, 1956) merged leucometopius
   within caniceps, an arrangement that has persisted, unchallenged in the
   technical literature, until the present. Through examination of 76
   specimens, extensive field experience of Cuban birds, and less
   exhaustive fieldwork in the Dominican Republic, we re-evaluate the
   taxonomic status of the Hispaniolan population, identifying consistent
   differences in coloration, tail length and characteristics of the second
   to fifth primaries between it and the Cuban population. Based on these
   differences, we suggest that caniceps (endemic to Cuba) and
   leucometopius (restricted to the Dominican Republic) be henceforth
   resurrected to species status. We were unable to undertake a complete
   analysis of the vocalizations of the two forms, due to the lack of
   definite recordings from Hispaniola, but present sonograms and notes
   concerning Cuban birds. Further work, including molecular analyses,
   would be clearly desirable to test our hypothesis. Both forms are
   undoubtedly declining due to habitat destruction and hunting, and both
   certainly qualify as Vulnerable under current IUCN criteria. Indeed,
   leucometopius may even qualify as Endangered under the range criterion.
   Its status requires particularly careful monitoring, while new
   information, published since the BirdLife International (2000) review of
   globally threatened birds, suggests that the range even of nominate
   caniceps is considerably smaller than previously considered.}},

Abstract = {{Pygmy Palm-Swift Micropanyptila furcata is endemic to the Maracaibo
   Basin of Venezuela and Colombia. Described by Sutton in 1928, it is
   still known only from < 30 museum specimens from seven localities,
   leading it to be included in the first edition of the bird Red Data
   Book, but not subsequent editions. During a field survey in January 1995
   we regularly encountered this species throughout the south-eastern
   Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela, at elevations from 30 m to 800 m. We found
   them in a variety of habitats including cleared pastures, cropland, open
   forest and rural towns, and observed them near mature cultivated palms,
   which represented nesting and roosting substrates. Pygmy Palm-Swifts
   foraged in small groups immediately above the treetops and over grass
   savannah. As we recorded them at nearly all previously known sites and
   many additional ones, often in close proximity to human activities and
   potential sources of disturbance, we suggest that it is not a rare bird
   and currently does not require special status or conservation efforts.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus is classed as globally
   Vulnerable, based on the only available population estimate, made in
   1977, Of 2,000-2,800 pairs. Surveys for breeding Spoon-billed Sandpipers
   were carried out in summer 2000 on the Anadyr estuary coast, the
   Chukotka autonomous region, Russia. Although six new breeding sites were
   found, only 16-17 breeding males/pairs were recorded on the northern
   coast of the Anadyr estuary and five males/pairs on the southern coast
   and more southerly lagoons. These numbers were much lower than expected,
   and the species was not recorded in several apparently suitable areas.
   Four formerly known breeding sites held only one displaying male between
   them. At no site was there evidence of an increasing or stable local
   population. Together with other indicative data these suggest a sharp
   decline in the population of Spoon-billed Sandpiper. The previous
   population size estimate obviously requires updating, both because there
   were some incorrect assumptions in the calculations made for the first
   population estimate, and also due to a recent population decline. It is
   likely that the current population numbers under 1,000 breeding pairs.
   Given that the population of this species may be substantially lower
   than the only previous estimate, and the evidence for a possible rapid
   decline in its population described in this paper, it is recommended
   that its IUCN status is changed from Vulnerable to Endangered. No
   reasons for the apparent rapid rate of decline are evident within the
   breeding range. ``Bottle-necks{''} should be looked for at migration
   sites or wintering grounds, but currently, monitoring of the population
   is only possible on the breeding grounds.}},

   (15 males, 60-66 females, four first-year males: total 75-81). Combining
   enquiry results from local people with these data, the population size
   for spring is estimated at 92-111 individuals, and 117-133 for winter.
   Reproduction is confirmed. Threats to the population include illegal
   hunting, habitat loss through agricultural intensification (irrigation,
   use of pesticides) and infrastructural changes (construction of a
   motorway and a powerplant), disturbance, and accidents at powerlines and
   antennas. Several conservation measures are suggested: cease hunting;
   maximize the attention given to display sites; encourage villagers to
   carry out ``Great Bustard-friendly{''} land use and adapt animal stocks
   to the carrying capacity of their regions; clarify the situation of
   genetic exchange between Spanish and Moroccan populations; study
   movements between the Moroccan sites; monitor the size and trends of the
   most important subpopulations; and conduct education campaigns in
   schools and increase public awareness among adults.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about Mexican Duck Anas diazi biology and populations.
   We analyse long-term (1960-2000) trends of Mexican Duck numbers in
   Mexico and employ contemporary count data (1991-2000) from the U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service midwinter surveys to identify key sites for
   conservation using a complementarity approach. The overall Mexican Duck
   population showed a significant long-term increase Of 2.5\% per year,
   with large fluctuations throughout the study period. The Northern
   highlands population increased at an annual rate Of 7.7\%, while the
   Central highlands population showed no significant long-term trend.
   During the last decade, counts in both the Northern and Central
   highlands exhibited no significant change. At the site level,
   significant long-term increases occurred in four localities in the
   Northern highlands (Laguna BabPcora +13.9\% annually, Laguna Bustillos
   +25.9\%, Laguna Mexicanos +20.4\% and Laguna Santiaguillo +16.9\%) and
   in three localities in the Central highlands (Languillo +15.3\%
   annually, Presa Solis +8.9\%, Zacapu +13.4\%). Two sites in the Central
   highlands showed significant declines, in the long term (Lago de
   Chapala, -5.2\% per year) and during the last decade (Lerma, -11.8\% per
   year). The Northern highlands held 16\% and the Central highlands 84\%
   of the Mexican Duck population in the period 1960-2000; during the last
   decade, these figures were 31\% and 69\%, respectively. A set of
   priority sites for conservation of the Mexican Duck was identified,
   consisting of 15 sites holding more than 70\% of the midwinter Mexican
   Duck counts in Mexico. Ten sites from the priority set also qualify for
   designation as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar
   Convention on Wetlands, by holding greater than or equal to1\% of the
   estimated population. Four of the priority sites are in the Northern
   highlands and 11 in the Central highlands, of which eight are
   distributed along the Rio Lerma drainage. The most urgent actions that
   need to be undertaken are to estimate the current minimum population
   size in Mexico; to establish a programme for monitoring populations in
   the priority sites, especially those located within the highly degraded
   Rio Lerma drainage; and to determine the most feasible management
   actions for the species, concentrating efforts around the priority
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Sangihe, Indonesia, was visited in 1998-99 with the aim of
   producing population estimates of the island's endemic and other
   restricted-range bird species, some of which were poorly known and
   thought to be at risk of extinction due to habitat change. The study
   focused on the last remaining patch of primary forest, on Mount
   Sahendaruman in southern Sangihe, home to three critically endangered
   endemic species: Cerulean Paradise-flycatcher Eutrichomyias rowleyi,
   Sangihe Shrike-thrush Colluricincla sanghirensis, and Sangihe White-eye
   Zosterops nehrkorni. Population densities were estimated from primary
   forest and secondary habitats across Sangihe to assess species
   dependency on primary habitat. Twenty Of 24 restricted-range, globally
   threatened or endemic taxa were recorded and density estimates were
   calculated for 15 of these. The endemic Red-and-blue Lory Eos histrio is
   extinct on Sangihe as a result of lowland forest loss. Six species
   (Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica, Sulawesi Dwarf Kingfisher Ceyx
   fallax, Golden Bulbul Ixos affinis, E. rowleyi, C. sanghirensis, and Z.
   nehrkorni) were either not recorded or have very small populations and
   are critically endangered on Sangihe; two species of Tanygnathus parrot
   are also facing local extinction on the island. The major threat to all
   these species is the destruction of primary forest; larger species are
   also threatened by hunting. The remaining endemic and restricted-range
   species (Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon Ducula concinna, Sangihe
   Hanging-parrot Loriculus catamene, Sangihe Scops-owl Otus collari,
   Lilac-cheeked Kingfisher Cittura cyanotis and Elegant Sunbird Aethopyga
   duyvenbodei) were more widespread and occurred in secondary habitats. I
   recommend that L. catamene and A. duyvenbodei, currently treated as
   globally endangered, be reclassified as near-threatened and vulnerable
   respectively because of their large populations and tolerance of
   disturbed habitats. Species with wide global ranges that are represented
   by endemic subspecies have the greatest tolerance for disturbed habitat.
   The widespread deforestation of Sangihe has had serious consequences for
   many bird species and today the island supports the most threatened
   assemblage of single-island endemic species in Indonesia.
   Species-specific research to determine the status and ecology of E.
   rowleyi, C. sanghirensis and Z. nehrkorni, and monitoring of the
   Sahendaruman forest are desperately needed as a basis for future
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres is endemic to southern Africa and is
   globally threatened. Colonies in Botswana comprise part of one of the
   two core breeding areas in the species's range, and very little has
   previously been published about them. Ground censusing of 11 Cape
   Vulture sites in Botswana was undertaken from 1992 to 1999, continuing a
   monitoring programme initiated by the authors in 1984. Survey methods
   and census procedures are documented. The potential Cape Vulture
   breeding population in Botswana is estimated to be about 600 pairs,
   comprising at least loo pairs at Mannyelanong in the south-east and
   about 500 pairs in eastern Botswana. This represents an increase from
   previous estimates, and reflects improved census techniques rather than
   an increase in population size. The mean turnover rate of nest site
   usage from one year to the next averaged 21\% at Mannyelanong, and was
   about 26\% at Manong Yeng in eastern Botswana. Annual productivity of
   nest sites increased with the number of years the site had been
   occupied. Over the eight years of study eggs were laid in at least 436
   Of 477 nests (91.4\%) at Mannyelanong; chicks survived to mid season
   (60-80 days old) in 327 nests (75\% of eggs laid), and fledged (best
   estimate) in 248 nests (56.9\% of eggs laid and 52\% of pairs attempting
   to breed). In eastern Botswana eggs were laid in at least 1,825 Of 2,101
   nests (86.9\%); chicks survived to mid season in 1,272 nests (69.7\% of
   eggs laid). Two seasons have been excluded for eastern Botswana (1994
   and 1995) due to incomplete data, and breeding success can be estimated
   only from 1997 to 1999: of 990 eggs laid out of 1,108 nests, chicks
   fledged in 384 nests (38.8\% of eggs laid and 34.6\% of pairs attempting
   to breed). The eastern Botswana breeding population remains in a state
   of flux following the collapse of a primary colony that was the
   country's Cape Vulture stronghold. Conservation concerns and the
   vulnerability of Cape Vulture sites are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Seabird colonies often constitute valuable tourist attractions.
   Different species differ in their sensitivity to human disturbance and,
   although birds may habituate to visitors, inappropriate intrusions at
   poorly managed sites may result in adverse effects on breeding
   individuals. The rapid growth of wildlife-based tourism and recreation
   in coastal Patagonia, Argentina, presents opportunities for significant
   economic benefits but also raises concerns about the potential effects
   on seabird colonies. Sixteen seabird species breed along the Patagonian
   coast, with Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus being one of the
   main tourist attractions. At least 27 sites where seabirds breed are
   currently visited by people either through organized tourism or for
   recreational purposes, 19 of which are included in coastal protected
   areas. The number of visitors per year varies from 50 to more than
   100,000, depending on the site. Negative effects on seabird reproduction
   in Patagonia are through direct destruction of nests or their contents
   and desertion of offspring, particularly at locations where seabirds
   nest in association with or near to colonies of avian predators. Tourism
   and recreation activities are growing in extent and intensity at most
   coastal sectors in Patagonia. Current trends in coastal recreation
   activities may result in negative effects on breeding seabirds unless
   management guidelines are developed and enforced. Information shows that
   tourism in coastal Patagonia is compatible with seabird conservation if
   appropriately managed. Given the rapid increase in the interest in
   visiting seabird colonies in Patagonia, several management tools such as
   sanctuaries, the limitation of visitor numbers and both temporal and
   spatial zoning, need to be implemented in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Vu. Quang Nature Reserve, Vietnam, was brought to the attention of the
   world scientific community following the discovery of two previously
   undescribed large mammal species in the early 1990s. In light of the
   identification of other sites of high biodiversity value in the Annamite
   mountains of Vietnam and Laos, the relative importance for biodiversity
   conservation of Vu Quang needs to be reassessed. In this paper we
   evaluate the importance of the site for bird conservation, in relation
   to 13 other protected areas in the Annamese Lowlands Endemic Bird Area
   (EBA) and present species lists for all 14 sites. Whilst Vu Quang
   supports one of the highest numbers of recorded bird species of all 14
   protected areas, a complementarity analysis revealed that Vu Quang does
   not fall within the critical subset of sites necessary to conserve 95\%
   of the avifaunal diversity of the EBA. The site should not, therefore,
   be considered a regional bird conservation priority. Furthermore, of the
   nine restricted-range species known from the Annamese Lowlands EBA, only
   three are known from Vu Quang, which is not, therefore, a priority site
   for the conservation of endemic bird species. We also evaluate the
   conservation status of the avifauna of Vu Quang, and propose potential
   conservation measures to enhance its importance for bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian Merganser Mergus octosetaceus is considered to be one of the
   rarest and most threatened species in the Neotropical region, yet little
   is known about its distribution and life-history. We studied the
   population of Brazilian Merganser in and around Serra da Canastra
   National Park (SCNP) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, during 1996, with
   additional observations from 1997 to 2000. In this paper we report the
   sighting of previously undiscovered pairs and present some new
   behavioural data, including a description of calls performed by males
   and females, feeding behaviour, home ranges, parental care and
   population density. We also describe a previously unreported plumage of
   the young. A total of 39 individuals were recorded, comprising 12 adults
   (six pairs) and 27 Young. Brood size ranged from two to four (mean 2.7),
   being smaller than in other Mergus spp. (e.g. Goosander Mergus
   merganser). Two pairs were located within the SCNP, and four on
   unprotected stretches of river outside. Home range was large compared
   with other Mergus spp., each pair using on average 9 km of river. Range
   size was thought to be related to the availability of suitable nesting
   and feeding sites. SCNP and its environs contain very little mature
   gallery forest with trees large enough to provide nest sites (most
   having been selectively logged in the past). There is also competition
   for nest sites with other birds and mammals. All suitable habitat
   surrounding the SCNP is now occupied by adult birds, leaving none for
   young birds. Further research is needed to determine the fate and
   dispersion routes of juveniles. Future conservation priorities for
   Brazilian Merganser in and around SCNP include the installation of nest
   boxes to test whether the availability of good quality nest sites limits
   breeding success. A captive breeding programme could be established
   using eggs from these nest boxes. This would help to ensure the survival
   of this species and to provide birds for future reintroduction
   programmes should they be deemed necessary. Further surveys, with
   subsequent establishment of reserves at key sites, are required
   throughout the Brazilian Merganser's range.}},

Abstract = {{Most of Brazil's electricity is generated by hydroelectric power plants
   that require the flooding of huge areas and affect the stability of
   local ecosystems. The area of the Porto Primavera power dam was flooded
   in 1998 and a rescue programme was executed to save the fauna sheltering
   on treetops or emerging islands. Using DNA fingerprinting we estimated
   the genetic variability in a sample of 23 Bare-faced Curassow Crax
   fasciolata rescued in this area and found that the mean heterozygosity
   was H = 0.89. Although similar data on other natural populations of
   cracids is not available, the mean heterozygosity observed in the
   present sample is in the range found for free-living populations of two
   species of reintroduced cracids whose origin was captive breeding of a
   limited number of founders. We suggest that a collaborative captive
   breeding and reintroduction programme between the facilities holding the
   birds caught at Porto Primavera should start immediately to avoid the
   loss of genetic variability due to the small number of founders in
   captivity. Habitat protection, responsibility in fauna management and
   measures that prevent or correct the isolation of habitat fragments are
   needed to establish an equilibrium between progress and conservation in
   developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Suwarrow (Suvorov) atoll is an important seabird breeding site in the
   central Pacific Ocean. However, it is not protected and is attractive to
   developers of potentially damaging aquaculture industries. In this paper
   I report the results of a survey conducted to establish the present
   status of Suwarrow's seabird colonies and to generate base-line data for
   measuring the effect of a proposed pearl-farm development. Between late
   July and early September 2000 the reef islets were surveyed for seabird
   chick numbers and age-states using a simple sampling method. In addition
   to Sooty Tern Sterna fuscata, populations of boobies Sula spp., noddies
   Anous spp., frigatebirds Fregata spp. and tropicbirds Phaethon spp. were
   assessed. Results showed that bird populations were maintaining levels
   similar to those from findings of surveys in 1992. Of particular note
   were globally significant numbers of Lesser Frigatebird Fregata ariel
   and Red-tailed Tropicbird Phaethon rubricauda. Migratory birds were
   observed with Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis regularly
   seen. The well-being of bird-life on the islets appears to be indirectly
   proportional to the proximity of human activity, with birds not observed
   breeding on Anchorage Island - the islet most often visited by people.}},

Abstract = {{We reviewed the importance of power lines as a cause of mortality for
   Eagle Owl in the Italian Alps. Power lines were the most important cause
   of unnatural mortality for this species, accounting for over 50\% of
   recorded casualties. The number of reported dead owls tended to be
   higher in September-October, suggesting an influence on juvenile
   dispersal. Furthermore, the significance of power lines as a cause of
   mortality increased over time, being lower in the 1960-1980 period than
   in 1981-1999. Electrocution, which usually takes place at medium-voltage
   (15-30 kV) electricity poles, accounted for the vast majority of
   casualties. We suggest some protective measures that may be put into
   practice in the proximity of Eagle Owl breeding territories.}},

Title = {{Status, abundance and habitat use of Blue-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua
   ophthalmica on New Britain, Papua New Guinea}},
Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Most research on cockatoos Cacatua outside Australia has focused on
   species that figure significantly in the pet trade. Here, we examine the
   status of Blue-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua ophthalmica, an extremely poorly
   known species endemic to the island of New Britain, in three lowland
   forest types: primary forest, forest that had been commercially logged
   of selected large trees in the previous eight years, and forest gardens
   (small-scale mixed agroforests or ``homegardens{''} tended by indigenous
   people). During fieldwork at two lowland study sites on New Britain
   between December 1998 and April 1999, groups of C. ophthalmica were
   recorded in all forest types (maximum group size = 40), but the species
   was largely absent from non-forested areas. Estimated cockatoo density
   in selectively logged forest (64 individuals per km(2)) was similar to
   that in primary forest but densities in forest gardens at both sites (6
   and 28 per km(2)) were considerably lower than those in primary forest
   (27 and 73 per km(2)). Most active nests found were in large trees in
   primary forest and the paucity of nests in logged forest, and
   particularly in forest gardens, is cause for concern given ongoing
   forest alteration on the island. While we predict that the Blue-eyed
   Cockatoo population on New Britain is declining, the species remains
   numerous and the current low levels of trapping and the large area of
   suitable forest remaining on the island indicate that the taxon is
   currently of ``Least Concern{''}. In a wider context, C, ophthalmica is
   considerably more common than most of the traded cockatoos, but the
   tendency for cockatoo densities to be highest in primary forest,
   intermediate in human-altered forests and lowest in non-forest areas
   holds for traded and untraded species alike.}},

Abstract = {{Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, south-west Uganda, supports 24 Of 37
   restricted-range bird species of the Albertine Rift Mountains Endemic
   Bird Area (EBA). In common with other montane forest fragments in the
   EBA, Bwindi's structure and ecology have been substantially modified by
   human activities, the impact of which on its birds is difficult to gauge
   in the absence of quantitative information on their habitat use and
   abundance. During October 1999, habitat associations of nine
   restricted-range species and of 12 species with which they were commonly
   associated, were measured at Ruhija, Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
   Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship
   between habitat, topography, altitude and species occurrence. Population
   densities of 19 species were estimated using distance sampling, at
   survey points visited between dawn and midday. Although the detection
   rate declined during the morning, observations made towards midday
   helped to improve precision, without lowering density estimates. Eight
   habitat and topographical features significantly associated with
   restricted-range species are described. Few of the features measured
   were significantly associated with more than one species, underlining
   the importance of maintaining a diverse forest structure. Two
   restricted-range species were among the commonest birds in the study
   area, while a further four species were at least as abundant as their
   more widespread congeners.}},

Abstract = {{Olrog's Gull Larus atlanticus is an endemic species of the Atlantic
   coast of southern South America. It is one of six globally threatened
   gull species in the world, and is classified as Vulnerable. We studied
   age-related differences in the diet and foraging behaviour of this
   species in Mar Chiquita Lagoon during the non-breeding season. Diet was
   assessed by analysis of regurgitation casts, prey carcasses and direct
   observation, while foraging behaviour was quantified by focal
   observations. Grapsid crabs were by far the main prey in frequency of
   occurrence, followed by fish and snails. Some differences in diet were
   found between ages, particularly in spring when mature birds start to
   feed on the eggs of ovigerous females of the crab Cyrtograpsus
   angulatus. Foraging behaviour was similar between ages which is
   attributed to large resource availability, foraging strategies and
   social factors.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the distribution of birds along an altitudinal gradient
   ranging from 800 m to 1,400 m on two slopes of the Serra do Cip6, Minas
   Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Ornithological surveys were conducted over
   transects covering open (cerrado, campo rupestre) and forested (gallery
   and Atlantic forest) habitats from 1994 to 2000. We found 273 bird
   species belonging to 51 families. Twenty-two species were restricted to
   higher elevations and 84 Species were detected on only one slope,
   depending on the vegetation type they inhabited. We recorded 104 species
   occurring on both slopes, while 61 species were considered altitudinal
   generalists. Six species, including Hyacinth Visorbearer Augastes
   scutatus and Cip6 Canastero Asthenes luizae were restricted to the
   highest parts of Serra do Cip6, a fragile habitat important to endemic
   birds of the Espinhaco Range. In the past 10 years, the Serra do Cip6
   region has suffered human impacts on a large scale, and conservation
   action must be developed to protect the fauna and flora confined to the
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Black-billed Parrot Amazona agilis and Yellow-billed Parrot A. collaria
   are endemic to Jamaica and are restricted to remnant patches of
   mid-elevation wet limestone forest. Cockpit Country is the stronghold of
   Black-billed Parrot and is the only region where these two species occur
   sympatrically in significant numbers. In northern Cockpit Country,
   Black-billed Parrots nested commonly in degraded and regenerating edge
   habitat, where natural nesting cavities did not appear to be limiting.
   Yellow-billed Parrot nests were less abundant in the study area.
   Black-billed Parrots produced clutches of 3 or 4 eggs and incubation was
   approximately 24 days. Nestling growth and development were
   characteristically slow and the nestling period prolonged. Nesting
   success of both species was low for non-excavating, cavity-nesting
   species, but successful nests were prolific. Black-billed Parrot
   nestling mortality was highest during the first four weeks of the
   nestling period, the primary cause being predation, followed by
   ``dead-in-nest, possible hypothermia{''}. Many aspects of Black-billed
   and Yellow-billed Parrot nesting behaviour may be related to predation.
   The majority of predation events were attributed to the endemic and
   Vulnerable yellow boa Epicrates subflavus. Such predator-prey dynamics
   will challenge Jamaica's natural resource managers to develop a more
   comprehensive attitude away from single-species conservation towards
   multiple species and their interactions in a complex habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of trapping migratory sparrowhawks Accipiter spp. for
   falconry and the indiscriminate hunting of other migratory raptors,
   together with an alleged trade in raptors, were investigated in the
   eastern Black Sea coastal region of the Republic of Georgia in 1998.
   Falconry and hunting are deeply rooted in Georgian tradition,
   exacerbated by the current socioeconomic crisis, and result in
   significant mortality of migratory raptors during the autumn migration
   along strategic bottlenecks in the Kolkheti Lowland and along the
   Atchara-Imereti mountain range. The mortality of migratory raptors
   resulting directly from hunting and trapping ranges between 1,500 and
   3,000 birds during the autumn migration. Education of trappers and
   hunters through constructive dialogue and advocating best practice is
   practicable and imperative to reduce the magnitude of raptors killed.}},

Abstract = {{From 1950 to 1999 there was a substantial decrease in the number of
   Imperial Eagles Aquila heliaca breeding in the Baikal region of eastern
   Russia, but there have been no apparent changes in habitat or breeding
   success within this region. Identification of wintering and stopover
   sites is therefore necessary to discover whether negative impacts at
   these sites could be causing the observed population decline. To this
   end, we satellite-tracked four juvenile Imperial Eagles from Lake Baikal
   to their wintering grounds. Two sibling eagles were tracked in 1998 and
   two siblings from a different brood in 1999. The eagles migrated through
   eastern Mongolia and central Inner Mongolia (China), and wintered from
   south China to Thailand. Siblings independently used the same migration
   flyway, and the flyway was different between families. These results
   provide useful information for determining the causes of the decline in
   the population of Imperial Eagles in the Baikal region.}},

Abstract = {{White-eared Night Heron Gorsachius magnificus is probably the most
   threatened heron species in the world, and the highest priority for
   heron species conservation. From 1990 to 1998, there were sightings from
   only six localities in the wild. There are none in captivity. In 1998 a
   caged bird was found in a wildlife market in the city of Nanning,
   Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. This
   finding prompted a 12-month survey in 1998-1999 of both markets and
   potential habitats in Guangxi. Several captured birds provided direct
   evidence of the existence of small populations in Guangxi and Guangdong
   Provinces. The respective habitats were surveyed in spring 2000, with
   emphasis on observations at dusk. The species was seen at two locations.
   Although some of the captured birds came from highly degraded habitat,
   the best sites seemed to be in areas near extensive primary forests,
   with streams, rice fields and marshes. The information obtained will be
   used to compile a detailed Action Plan designed to prevent the
   extinction of the species.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Transect bird surveys were conducted at 43 tallgrass prairies in
   southwestern Missouri, U.S.A. in mid-June each year from 1992 to 1999.
   Litter volume on and near the ground was estimated on a nine-point scale
   during 1994 to 1999. The relative importance of management type
   (rotational burning, rotational haying, or a combination of both) and
   litter volume on relative abundance was analysed for three declining
   grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, Grasshopper
   Sparrow A. savannarum, and Dickcissel Spiza americana. Haying resulted
   in significantly higher abundance than burning for all species except
   Dickcissel, for which few significant management effects were detected.
   Henslow's Sparrow increased in abundance from light to heavy litter,
   Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in low to intermediate litter, and Dickcissel
   showed little pattern relative to litter. Litter scores recorded in each
   management type increased with number of years since last treatment.
   Although litter profoundly affected bird abundance, independent and
   equally important was whether that litter was obtained via haying or
   burning. Greater consistency among years in hayed vegetation structure
   may help explain these birds' preference for haying over burning or
   haying + burning. Rotational haying should be employed more than burning
   in the management of these declining birds, especially for the sharply
   declining, fire-sensitive Henslow's and Grasshopper Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{New World parrots are declining throughout their range. Blue and Gold
   Macaw Ara ararauna was extirpated from the island of Trinidad in the
   late 1960s through anthropogenic processes. The Cincinnati Zoo \&
   Botanical Garden is assisting the Wildlife Section of the Forestry
   Division, Trinidad on a mission to restore the species into its
   historical range within the Bush-Bush Sanctuary in the Nariva Swamp. The
   Sanctuary has been protected by the government of Trinidad and is the
   home of the endangered Red-bellied Macaw Ara manilata and West Indian
   Manatee Trichechus manatus. Zoo and Wildlife personnel participated in
   three separate releases, beginning in December 1999 through to March
   2000. The initial release consisted of an identical sex group of macaws
   followed by two additional releases of pairs/groups of birds. Of 18 Blue
   and Gold Macaws, 14 were released into the Nariva Swamp and are
   currently being monitored by the Wildlife Section, Zoo personnel and
   surrounding community. Translocation of wild populations of parrots has
   proven to be a viable solution to restocking wild populations that have
   been regionally extirpated.}},

   a mean annual death rate of 4.5 birds per too poles (95\% confidence
   interval: 3.0-6.03), of which 53.8\% were diurnal birds of prey. We
   identified all power poles in the distribution area of the Spanish
   Imperial Eagle Aquila adalberti population of the Donana area. The
   estimated total mortality for adults was 0.38 birds per year and for
   immature eagles 3.38, which was 1.3\% of the adult population and 30.0\%
   of the mean annual number of fledged young. Adequate modification of
   18.6\% of power poles in the distribution area of the eagle population

Abstract = {{Bird surveys were conducted through observations and mist-netting in six
   forest fragments in the cerrado region of central Brazil, to evaluate
   the effects of fragmentation on bird species richness and community
   composition. Smaller forest fragments had fewer species than larger
   fragments. The proportion of species in most foraging guilds did not
   change with forest size, except for that of granivores, which decreased
   as fragment size increased. The proportion of forest-dependent species
   increased significantly with increasing fragment size while that of
   semi-dependent species significantly decreased. Forest-dependent endemic
   birds, however, were not area sensitive, but appeared to be partially
   dependent on the flooded forests of the region. Conservation policies
   for the region should conserve both large and small forest fragments
   urgently, and flooded forests especially.}},

Abstract = {{Olrog's Gull Larus atlanticus is a vulnerable species endemic to the
   Argentine Atlantic coast. We present information on new breeding
   colonies, update information on known colonies, and describe habitat and
   nest site characteristics of Olrog's Gulls breeding at Bahia San Bias,
   southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. information was obtained
   during the 1998 breeding season. We recorded four colonies on islets,
   with a total population size of 305 pairs. Colonies were located on open
   ground, partly bordered by vegetation. The two colonies at Islote Arroyo
   Jabali Oeste were located more than 150 m from the high tide Line, while
   the two colonies at Banco Nordeste were placed only a few metres from
   the high tide mark (1-6 m). Most nests were located more than a metre
   away from low Atriplex patagonica bushes (20-30 cm high) and herbaceous
   species, although a few nests were a few cm from vegetation. Nests were
   built on vegetation debris, on low herbaceous vegetation, and on gravel
   and sand. All nests at the four colonies were built with vegetation
   debris, mainly Spartina densiflora and some Salicornia sp. Mean external
   and internal diameters of nests were 40.57 +/- 5.14 and 19.71 +/- 2.21
   cm, respectively. Gulls nested in discrete groups at relatively high
   densities, which ranged between 0.62 and 1.1 nests/m(2). Nest occupation
   and number of eggs per nest varied among colonies. Kelp Gulls Larus
   dominicanus were observed nesting in close proximity to all colonies.
   Further studies are needed to assess habitat partitioning between these
   two species, particularly considering that they nest in association at
   all breeding locations in coastal Argentina and that Kelp Gulls have
   shown an important population increase in recent decades.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Tristan Albatross Diomedea {[}exulans] dabbenena is the most genetically
   distinct of the five taxa that form the Wandering Albatross
   superspecies, and has been Listed as Endangered. It breeds only on Gough
   and Inaccessible Islands in the Tristan da Cunha group, central South
   Atlantic Ocean. The entire breeding population was surveyed during
   1999-2000. A mid-September survey at Cough Island recorded 1,129 chicks,
   equivalent to an annual breeding effort by approximately 1,500 pairs.
   Only one chick was present at Inaccessible Island in 1999, and another
   pair laid an egg in 2000. The annual breeding effort at this island has
   not exceeded three pairs since the 1950s. None were found during an
   incomplete survey at Tristan, where the species bred in the past, but
   birds were seen flying over the island. A complete survey and attempts
   to promote recolonization of Tristan are warranted. Breeding success at
   Gough Island averaged 63\%, and no birds that bred successfully
   attempted to breed the following year. Breeding success was greater and
   less variable in a large colony at Gonydale than at a peripheral colony
   at Tafelkop. Young birds returned to the island after 3-4 years (4-5
   years old), and the modal age of first breeding was 8 years, with some
   individuals breeding as young as 6 years. Most chicks (81\%) recruited
   to their natal colony, but some recruited to colonies up to 3 km from
   their natal site. Among adults, fidelity to partners and breeding colony
   was high. Of nine birds recovered away from the island, at least four
   were killed by longline fishing. Despite its known mortality on
   longlines, the Gough Island census exceeded demipopulation estimates
   from the 1970s and early 1980s, possibly due to incomplete coverage by
   previous surveys and a poor breeding season in 1998. Given the lack of
   evidence for a population decrease, Tristan Albatross should be listed
   as Vulnerable. It is the third rarest albatross species, however, and
   its population size warrants monitoring. We provide guidelines for
   repeatable censuses at Gough Island.}},

Abstract = {{Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserve, Dak Lak Province, Vietnam, is within an
   area of high bird endemism and supports a number of globally threatened
   and restricted-range species. Data were collected on the bird
   communities of the Reserve and their habitat in 1995, to ascertain
   habitat associations of some of the endemic and threatened taxa. Birds
   were surveyed in circular plots around a recording point. Habitat
   associations were investigated using Discriminant Function Analysis, and
   populations estimated using DISTANCE.
   Seven restricted-range species and 38 restricted-range subspecies were
   recorded in the survey. The number of contacts with some of the endemic
   species was low, which limited the statistical investigation of the
   habitat requirements of these species. When analysis was possible,
   altitude was the most important of the factors measured determining
   species distributions, while measures of forest architecture seemed less
   important. The area appears to support important populations of several
   restricted-range taxa and, provided that protection and management of
   the protected area can be enhanced, it remains one of the most important
   areas for bird conservation in southern Vietnam. Some drawbacks of the
   techniques used in the survey are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Biogeographical endemism and habitat restriction are two easily measured
   quantities that can be used as indicators of species' ecological
   restrictions. We analysed and compared these two types of information
   from available literature sources in an attempt to identify all bird
   species critically dependent on tropical deciduous forests of western
   Mexico and Central America. Based on patterns of biogeographical
   restriction, we identified 42 endemics, 33 disjunct endemics, 59
   corridor species and 3 seasonal endemics associated with tropical
   deciduous forest (TDF) in this region. Based on patterns of habitat use
   in these species, we classified them as 50 tropical deciduous
   forest-restricted species and 82 apparent habitat generalist species. No
   habitat use information was available within the TDF belt for five of
   the biogeographically restricted species. We found a high proportion of
   apparent habitat generalists (60\%) among biogeographically restricted
   species. We discuss three specific scenarios in which species critically

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In the Cerrado of Brazil, the largest Neotropical savanna region, open
   habitats are suffering an intense process of conversion to pasture and
   agricultural land. This study evaluated the responses of birds to the
   thinning of tree and shrub cover in plots of cerrado sensu stricto, the
   dominant habitat in the region, and examined whether disturbed plots
   supported bird communities of open natural habitats with similar
   structure. Birds were censused by point counts in five disturbed sites
   and in seven preserved patches, with a total of 304 samples of 20
   minutes in 68 points. Cleared plots were not suitable for species
   strongly dependent on trees and shrubs, such as frugivores and most
   insectivores. Their abundance was associated with the complexity of
   vegetation structure in these plots. Shrubby pastures held about 120\%
   more species than the traditional cleared ones. Bird communities of
   pastures showed large differences in relation to those of grasslands
   with similar structure. Communities of pastures were dominated by a
   seedeater, the Blue-black Grassquit Volatinia jacarina, and most species
   were habitat generalist or oportunistic predators, such as raptors and
   insectivores. Obligate grassland species, like the Grass Wren
   Cistothorus platensis, Cock-tailed Tyrant Alectrurus tricolor and
   Black-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis, as well as other abundant
   species in grasslands, such as Sharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora
   caudacuta and Capped Seedeater Sporophila bouvreuil do not adapt to
   pastures. Grassland grasses probably do not recover spontaneously in
   abandoned pastures and in other agricultural lands. Thus, conservation
   of grassland birds will strongly depend on a urgent programme of
   identification and protection of large areas of Cerrado dominated by
   campo limpo and campo sujo. These species would also benefit from the
   maintenance of a band of grassland along gallery forests.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1980s, exhausted pastures in Ecuador have been
   increasingly abandoned, allowing forest regeneration. At approximately
   2,200 m in the Tandayapa valley I surveyed four abandoned pastures to
   evaluate their use by birds. Each former pasture represented a different
   age of vegetation maturity. The number of bird species recorded in each
   successively older abandoned pasture increased but only half the number
   of species recorded in the undisturbed forest site was recorded in the
   most mature pasture. However, at least four restricted-range bird
   species were recorded in a single pasture. As pastures rapidly convert
   to secondary forest, more bird species and rarer bird species use them,
   even in highly disturbed areas where surrounding pristine forest
   constitutes less than 10\% of local forest cover. Conservation efforts
   should then be directed toward them.}},

   1914 On the Cape Verde archipelago. In 1996 and 1997, the first census
   of both kites on the entire archipelago (Hille 1998) revealed that fewer
   than 10 individuals of each species still existed and that extinction of
   all kites on Cape Verde was imminent. As expected from this first
   survey, the tiny island populations of kites further declined and only
   two individual Red Kites and one Black Kite were found in 1999. Both
   populations are expected to become extinct very soon. The presumed
   causes of extinction such as indirect poisoning, lack of food in a
   changing landscape, and human persecution are discussed.}},

   the type-locality for other threatened bird species are made.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{We examined the influence of fruit availability and habitat disturbance,
   including past and recent forest fires, on an assemblage of hornbills
   over a four-month period in the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park,
   Sumatra. The assemblage is dominated by Wreathed Hornbills Aceros
   undulatus (7.5 birds/km(2)), followed by Bushy-crested Hornbills
   Anorrhinus galeritus (3.05 birds/km2), Rhinoceros Hornbills Buceros
   rhinoceros (2.6 birds/km(2)), and Helmeted Hornbills Buceros vigil (1.9
   birds/km(2)). Overall densities for each species were consistent with
   estimates from other South-East Asian sites but densities varied
   temporally and spatially, even for territorial species. We speculate
   that Rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbills may exhibit facultative
   territoriality or they may not be territorial at this site. We found a
   positive relationship between temporal variability in hornbill numbers
   and the availability of ripe fruits. All hornbills, especially
   Rhinoceros and Bushy-crested Hornbills, tended to avoid highly disturbed
   areas; these areas had a lower than expected number of fruiting trees in
   five important hornbill diet families. Densities of Bushy-Crested,
   Rhinoceros, and Helmeted Hornbills declined from 28 to 63\% in the
   post-burn surveys. Wreathed Hornbills, however, increased slightly in
   the post-burn surveys, possibly because they were nesting there at the
   time. Movement of hornbills between disturbed and primary forest habitat
   may enhance regeneration of disturbed areas if hornbills are
   transporting viable seeds.}},

Abstract = {{The controversy that presently surrounds the taxonomy of the
   Orange-fronted Cyanoramphus malherbi and Forbes' C. forbesi Parakeets
   has important implications for the conservation of both birds. Both taxa
   are critically endangered, but consensus regarding their specific status

   the cytochrome b gene and the control region from 17 Cyanoramphus
   parakeets representing nine populations and six taxa together with field
   observations of courtship and breeding behaviour in a sympatric
   population of Orange-fronted and Yellow-crowned Parakeets C. auriceps.
   Field data support species status of the Orange-fronted Parakeet under
   the Biological Species Concept. Phylogenetic analyses of our DNA
   sequence data support earlier hypotheses based on allozyme data that
   both Orange-fronted and Forbes' Parakeets represent distinct species
   under four species concepts and indicate that high conservation priority

Abstract = {{We investigated how North Island Weka Gallirallus australis greyi could
   be conserved in situ at East Cape, New Zealand using banded and
   radiotransmitter-carrying Weka to measure home range size and use,
   reproduction and mortality. We fitted radiotransmitters to 28 Weka with
   75\% of the subsequent fixes from 18 birds being obtained at intervals
   of < 4 days. Home ranges of to males had an estimated median size of
   10.6 ha, while 5 female home ranges had an estimated median size of 3.5
   ha. Home ranges of individuals of both sexes overlapped. Within their
   home ranges, Weka preferred bush relative to pasture and may have
   preferred pines to pasture. Weka did not significantly prefer bush to
   pines. Breeding occurred year-round, with a summer peak, but 11 breeding
   pairs raised only four chicks to independence in two years. The causes
   of egg and chick mortality could not be established, but predators
   killed six adults, motor vehicles killed six and one adult died in a
   trap. Measurements of body size revealed that a male-biased sex ratio
   was Likely (67:33) We concluded that the recovery of the North Island
   Weka population in the East Cape region will require improving
   reproductive success and decreasing predation on adults. We recommend
   that managers focus on predator removal and habitat creation in future.}},

Pages = {{255-275}},

Abstract = {{The conservation status of the Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis, a
   Bolivian endemic, is assessed using the most recent information
   available. The known range of the species is patchily distributed within
   an 8,600 km(2) area of lowland savanna-forest habitat in the Beni
   department, under private ownership for cattle ranching, which is the
   main form of land use in the region. Population surveys of the
   Blue-throated Macaw revealed this species to exist in very low numbers.
   The immediate threat to the species is illegal trapping for the live
   bird trade. Effects of cattle grazing and savanna burning may modify
   habitat characteristics, but there is no direct evidence suggesting that
   these factors negatively influence the ecological requirements of Ara
   glaucogularis. The species is highly associated with the Attalea
   phalerata palm, which it uses for feeding and nesting. Current
   conservation efforts include: population and distribution surveys and
   assessment of habitat requirements; environmental awareness targeted at
   landowners and ranch personnel; collaboration with subnational and
   central government bodies; and development of strategies to curtail
   parrot trafficking activities. Recommendations for the long-term
   conservation of the species include increasing the involvement of
   landowners to strengthen protection for wild macaws; working with the
   Bolivian government on strategies to curb macaw trafficking; increasing
   environmental education activities with local inhabitants; basic
   research on breeding requirements and limitations of wild Blue-throated
   Macaws; and investigating the application of private reserves to the
   Blue-throated Macaw range.}},

Abstract = {{Population densities of the near-threatened Black-faced Cotinga
   Conioptilon mcilhennyi were investigated during a 21-month survey of

   Surveys for the species were conducted at two locations along the Rio

   floodplain/seasonally flooded swamp forest mosaic habitat than in
   seasonally flooded swamp forest. Regional population estimates along the
   Rio Madre de Dies, Rio Parramanu and Rio de las Piedras range from 1,153
   to 2,178 individuals. Current threats to this species and its habitat
   are discussed along with several conservation recommendations, including

   existing Zona Reservada de Tambopata-Candamo are expanded to encompass
   suitable Black-faced Cotinga habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We report the rediscovery of the Cherry-throated Tanager Nemosia rourei
   in southern Espirito Santo, Brazil, in February 1998, and the first
   substantive observations of its behaviour, vocalizations and other
   aspects of its natural history. Approximately to individuals,
   occasionally in groups of up to five birds, were located in humid
   montane forest at 1,100 m a.s.l. at the privately owned ``Fazenda
   Pindobas IV{''} (20 degrees 19'S, 41 degrees 17'W). This small
   population appears to be safe, as the property owners are preserving the
   remaining native forest there, and hope soon to register the land as a
   Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN). The species probably also
   occurs at similar elevations on neighbouring fazendas. Past reports of
   the species are reviewed, and the accuracy of the type locality,
   ``Muriae, Minas Gerais{''} is re-evaluated. As a result, we suggest that
   our locality of rediscovery, Jatibocas, where Helmut Sick surely saw a
   group of eight birds in August 1941, and the Nova Lombardia (= Augusto
   Ruschi) Biological Reserve, where a single individual was certainly
   sighted by Derek Scott and others in October 1995, all in south-central
   Espirito Santo, be considered the only confirmed points of occurrence of
   the Cherry-throated Tanager.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the impact of forest fire on the nesting success of the
   endemic Red-knobbed Hornbill Aceros cassidix in north Sulawesi,
   Indonesia. Pre- and post-fire breeding activity was monitored at 60 nest
   trees. Low rainfall and possible reductions in fruit abundance did not
   appear to have an effect on initial nest uptake or on subsequent chick
   production at non-burnt nests, which were comparable to previous years.
   However, there was an adverse effect on productivity at nests that
   directly experienced fire and the accompanying heat and smoke in the
   vicinity, resulting in a post-fire nest success (62\%) that was
   significantly lower than in previous years (78.6-80\%). Population
   recruitment dropped by an estimated 47\% to 0.17 fledglings/breeding
   pair. Our data suggest that, given the reproductive profile of this
   species and the ability of fire to reinforce its own negative effects on
   forest habitats, Red-knobbed Hornbill populations may be vulnerable to
   the potential effects of repeated fires.}},

   Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis in Kenya and Tanzania}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the distribution and habitat selection of the
   globally threatened East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis in
   Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, the Shimba Hills (both Kenya) and the lowland
   East Usambara Mountains (Tanzania). The species is more abundant than
   originally thought. In Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, akalats occur in two of
   the main vegetation types, and an estimated 7,500-9,000 territories
   represent one of the largest populations of this species in the world.
   Akalats occurred at similar densities to those in Arabuko-Sokoke (c. 0.5
   pairs/ha) in parts of Shimba Hills and East Usambaras, but were more
   patchily distributed. This akalat prefers areas where the undergrowth is
   partially open with large amounts of dead wood. It forages on or near
   the ground. In Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, areas where akalats were present
   had a higher abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods than areas where
   they were not. The akalat inhabits both primary forest and regenerated
   areas that have been selectively logged probably more than 20 years ago.
   Despite its relatively high densities where it occurs, this species
   (like other threatened birds in the East African coastal forests) is
   very patchily distributed and dependent on a habitat that is now highly
   fragmented and under considerable human pressure. The conservation
   situation in Arabuko-Sokoke gives cause for concern, and the destructive
   effects of a large elephant population threaten the forests of the
   Shimba Hills. The conservation status of the lowland Usambara Mountains
   is probably better and more stable.}},

Abstract = {{Densities and population estimates are presented for the little known
   Yellow-breasted Racquet-tail Parrot Prioniturus flavicans, a species
   endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Sixteen months of
   fieldwork was conducted within two protected areas in the island's
   northern peninsula. Densities were found to be much greater in the
   Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park than in the Tangkoko Duasaudara
   Nature Reserve: 16.27 and 7.18 birds/km(2), respectively. The species
   has a much more restricted range than previously thought, being confined
   to the eastern two-thirds of the north peninsula. The remaining suitable
   habitat within this range, lowland rainforest, is estimated to be c.
   11,300 km(2). Using this figure in conjunction with density values we
   estimate that the world population for this species may be greater than
   44,650 birds. Whilst such a population size is higher than previously
   thought, the very restricted distribution of the species causes concern
   for its future as loss emd fragmentation of forest habitat are ongoing
   within its range.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-148}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As an island endemic, the Island Scrub-Jay's Aphelocoma insularis
   population status and conservation are of concern. In addition, because
   the Island Scrub-Jay is easily observed, it is an ideal candidate for
   monitoring the effects of management efforts on Santa Cruz Island,
   California. We used estimates of territory size in several different
   habitats occupied by the Island Scrub-Jay and the total area of these
   habitats on the island to develop an empirical estimate of the
   population size for this species. Our most conservative, and we feel
   most realistic, estimate for the Island Scrub-Jay breeding population is
   7,000 individuals and for the non-breeding population 5,500 individuals,
   yielding a total population estimate of 12,500. Even though
   conservative, this estimate is larger than earlier estimates of 4,000 to
   6,000 individuals. Even so, our data suggest no reason exists for
   immediate concern regarding the population viability of the Island
   Scrub-Jay and they provide a baseline for future estimates and
   comparisons. Most importantly, this population estimate can be used to
   monitor the influence on the Island Scrub-Jay of future island
   management efforts, especially regarding exotic tree species and feral
   pigs.}},

Abstract = {{The Philippine islands hold a concentration of species diversity and
   endemism of global importance, yet few studies have analyzed
   biogeographic patterns or attempted to prioritize areas for conservation
   within the archipelago. We analyzed distributions of 386 species on 28
   Philippine islands and island groups, documenting intense concentration
   of species richness, especially of endemic species, on the two largest
   islands, Mindanao and Luzon. Factors identified as influencing species
   richness included island area, maximum elevation, and Pleistocene
   patterns of connection and isolation. Reserve systems were developed
   based on heuristic complementarity algorithms, and compared with the
   existing Integrated Protected Areas (IPAS) system in the country,
   showing that IPAS is an impressive first step towards protecting avian
   diversity in the country. Addition of presently proposed reserves on
   Palawan and Mindoro would make IPAS a near-optimal reserve design, at
   least at the level of island representation. Important challenges
   remain, however, with regard to design of reserve systems within islands
   to represent complete island avifaunas.}},

Abstract = {{A study of Corn Buntings Miliaria calandra, a rapidly declining
   red-listed species in the United Kingdom, was conducted over five years
   in the intensively cultivated, arable landscape of north-east Essex,
   eastern England. Mean densities in study plots ranged from 8 to 15
   territories per km(2), with evidence of a decline over the five years. A
   total of 278 singing males was located in 247 km(2) of farmland, some
   2-3\% of the U.K. population and therefore of national significance. The
   distribution of territories was highly clumped and there was marked
   territory fidelity between years. There was a strong preference for
   territories encompassing field boundaries without hedges and a general
   avoidance of hedges. Territories occupied in four or five years were
   more likely to contain water-filled ditches and/or weedy farm tracks
   than territories occupied in a single year. Song posts may be important
   resources. There was little preference shown for particular crops or
   other land-uses during the breeding season. During the winter period
   there was a strong selection for feeding on the small amount of grass,
   and in the late winter period, on stubbles. Lack of feeding
   opportunities in winter would appear to be critical to Corn Buntings. It
   is suggested that a retention of stubbles over winter on the 26\% of
   farmland destined for spring sowing could be highly beneficial to Corn
   Bunting: populations and that this could be initially targeted at those
   areas currently holding dense breeding populations.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of nests of the Visayan Tarictic Hornbill Penelopides panini
   panini on the Philippine island of Panay revealed thus far undescribed
   information on the breeding biology of this species. Females occupied
   nest holes in March-April, after which two or three eggs are laid.
   Although cooperative breeding is suspected for the genus, at two nests
   no helpers were recorded. Nest-concealment behaviour was observed in the
   adult male. After a nestling period of 55-58 days, the adult female and
   one juvenile left the nest simultaneously. Immature birds resemble their
   respective sex. Nest site characteristics of 24 nests of the Tarictic
   Hornbill and two of the Writhed-billed Hornbill Aceros waldeni,
   respectively, were recorded on Mt Balabag, Panay Mountain Range.
   Tarictic Hornbill nests were situated in living as well as dead trees,
   at an average height of 11 m. Cavity compass direction was uniformly
   distributed around the circle. Nests are aggregated within the habitat,
   with a mean nearest-neighbour distance of 190 m. Writhed-billed
   Hornbills may require larger trees for nesting than Tarictic Hornbills.
   Nest density was calculated to be around three Tarictic Hornbill nests
   and 0.2-0.3 Writhed-billed Hornbill nests per square kilometre. Given a
   total amount of suitable hornbill habitat on Panay of 225-450 km(2),
   about 750-1,000 Tarictic Hornbill breeding pairs and 60-100
   Writhed-billed Hornbill breeding pairs may remain on Panay.}},

Abstract = {{The Orange-breasted Falcon Falco deiroleucus, among the world's most
   poorly known falcons, is sparsely distributed in Neotropical forests
   from south-east Mexico or Guatemala to Paraguay and northern Argentina.
   Details of distribution and population size are poorly known throughout
   the species's range. From 1992 to 1997 we studied this species at 19
   nest sites in Guatemala and Belize. Occupancy and productivity rates
   remained stable for this northernmost population over this six-year
   period. Sparse data on historical distribution preclude a full
   assessment of possible changes in population status in the Mesoamerican
   portion of the species's range. Today the species appears restricted to
   forested areas in conjunction with large nesting cliffs. No breeding
   record is known for any Mesoamerican nation except Belize and Guatemala.
   Mean number of fledglings per successful nesting was significantly
   higher in areas of predominantly forested mosaic habitat (2.11, n = 18)
   than at sites with uninterrupted mature forest (1.36, n = 11);
   proportion of sites occupied and of pairs fledging young did not differ
   between these two habitats. Based on historical and current distribution
   records and distribution of potential nesting habitat, we conclude that
   the Guatemala/Belize population of Orange-breasted Falcons is disjunct
   from the species's main range in South America, is perhaps the only
   local population (at best one of a small number) in Mesoamerica, and is
   tightly linked to the existence of suitable nesting cliffs combined with
   large forested areas.}},

Abstract = {{A rocky area in Lamto, Ivory Coast, which is partly surrounded by
   plantations, was searched for nests of the White-necked Picathartes
   Picathartes gymnocephala. A total of 34 nests was found of which to were
   only remnants, 12 old and 12 rather new. One nest contained two chicks.
   It is suggested that ecotourism might be a suitable means to help to
   protect the species, but care has to be taken to avoid any further

Title = {{Conservation evaluation for birds of Brachylaena woodland and mixed dry

Abstract = {{Three forest and woodland sites were surveyed in the lowlands of the
   East Usambara mountains, Tanzania, from August to October, 1996. Bombo
   East I and II Proposed Forest Reserves (PFR) and Bombo West FR were
   previously unknown biologically Our fieldwork revealed several records
   of conservation interest. Four species of global conservation concern
   (Amani Sunbird Anthreptes pallidigaster, Southern Banded Snake Eagle
   Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer's Turaco Tauraco fischeri and
   Plain-backed Sunbird Anthreptes reichenowi) were recorded, with a
   further seven species of regional concern. These sites were not as rich
   in bird species as other East Usambara lowland forests. Bombo East I PFR
   had the highest richness, which included the presence of three montane
   species that were most likely cold-season visitors. The Endangered
   Sokoke Scops Owl Otus ireneae, otherwise known from similar woodland
   habitat in Kenya as well as lowland forest in the East Usambaras, was
   apparently absent at these sites. It is also clear from our survey that
   at least four threatened mammals and one possibly endemic snake inhabit
   the Brachylaena woodlands and mixed dry forest. Thus, our results
   indicate that the previously unexplored Brachylaena woodlands and mixed
   dry forest in north-east Tanzania are an additional habitat to some
   fauna of threatened status and do, therefore, merit conservation
   attention. The Brachylaena tree is highly favoured for charcoal
   production and the enormous demand for this product is increasing the
   degradation of these woodland patches. Larger tracts of unprotected
   Brachylaena woodland should receive immediate conservation attention.}},

Abstract = {{The Faunal Reserve of the Lobeke area of south-eastern Cameroon is an
   important area for forest conservation. One day, it is hoped, it will be
   part of an international unit, in association with two protected areas
   in neighbouring countries (Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African
   Republic and Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Congo). With a view to
   assessing the status of its avifauna in particular, 24 days were spent
   in three short surveys from 1997 to 1999. The main forest type is
   semi-evergreen, with an open canopy; the only natural savannas are small
   saline swamps. The total of 305 species of bird recorded includes a
   forest nightjar not yet identified (but more Likely to be the rare
   Itombwe Nightjar Caprimulgus prigoginei than a new species) and the Dja
   River Warbler Bradypterus grandis. The latter is a species confined to
   Rhynchospora swamps and had not been re-located in Cameroon since it was
   first collected in 1914 west of the Dja river; the extent of suitable
   habitat in Lobeke makes this site the most important to date for its
   conservation. Other rare or little-known forest species recorded include
   Olive Ibis Bostrychia olivacea, Sandy Scops Owl Of us icterorhynchus,
   Zenker's Honeyguide Meligomon zenkeri, Tessmann's Flycatcher Muscicapa
   tessmanni and Yellow-capped Weaver Ploceus dorsomaculatus. Barred Owlet
   Glaucidium capense is locally common in open-canopy forest: this
   population was only recently discovered in central Africa and its
   taxonomic relationships have yet to be determined. We include a brief
   comparison with the avifauna of adjacent Dzangha-Ndoki National Park and
   Nouabale-Ndoki National Park. A feature of the Lobeke avifauna is the
   presence of a few species normally associated with forest at higher
   altitudes (such as White-headed Wood Hoopoe Phoeniculus bollei, Uganda
   Woodland Warbler Phylloscopus budongoensis, Black-throated Apalis Apalis
   jacksoni), and perhaps absent from lower-lying Nouabale-Ndoki.}},

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{299-314}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present information on the current population status of seabirds that
   breed along the Patagonian coast obtained between 1993 and 1995. A total
   of 16 species, including two penguins, one petrel, five cormorants,
   three gulls, three terns and two skuas, breed along the 3,400-km coast
   from southern Buenos Aires (38 degrees 58'S) to Tierra del Fuego (54
   degrees 50'5) Breeding seabirds are not as abundant in coastal Argentina
   as was previously thought. Eleven of the 16 species have less than 5,000
   pairs. The most abundant seabird is the Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus
   magellanicus with 964,000 pairs, an order of magnitude higher than all
   other species. As well as Magellanic Penguins, Kelp Gulls Larus
   dominicanus, and Imperial Cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps are
   relatively abundant and have a wide distribution. Other seabirds, such
   as Red-legged Cormorants P. gaimardi, Olrog's Gulls L, atlanticus, and
   Dolphin Gulls L. scoresbii, have a highly restricted distribution or
   nest in small colonies at a few sites in Argentina. The Patagonian coast
   is one of the most pristine coastal ecosystems in the world and, thus
   far, few seabirds are seriously threatened. However, oil pollution and
   commercial fisheries are having a negative impact on some seabirds and
   some colonies have shown recent declines. Current threats and impacts,
   including pollution, fisheries, human disturbance, guano harvesting, and
   introduction of alien species are discussed. There are currently 34
   protected coastal areas, although in many cases protection measures are
   not adequately enforced and some areas with high seabird diversity and
   abundance still lack legal and effective protection. Conservation
   actions and requirements, including direct actions, monitoring and
   research are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{We report the current status of birds at the Namuli Massif, northern
   Mozambique. Despite being the only known locality for the Namuli Apalis
   Apalis lynesi and the nominate race of the Dapplethroat Arcanator
   orostruthus, the mountain is very little known ornithologically. Prior
   to our survey it had only been visited by an ornithologist in 1932, when
   Jack Vincent collected in the area for three weeks. During our week-long
   survey in November-December 1998 we recorded 130 bird species from the
   Namuli area, including all three globally threatened species reported by
   Vincent (Thyolo Alethe Alethe choloensis, Dapplethroat and Namuli
   Apalis). The higher-elevation (>1,500 m) forests are still largely
   intact, but most of those at lower elevations have been cleared for
   agriculture. The alethe and apalis are common, occurring in remnant
   forest patches and secondary scrub as well as pristine forest from 1,160
   to 2,000 m. The Dapplethroat is restricted to large, intact forests
   above 1,500 m,but also is fairly common (up to 2-3 singing males per
   hectare; greater densities than recorded elsewhere). Red-rumped Swallow
   Hirundo daurica was recorded for the first time in Mozambique, and was
   suspected of breeding at 1,400 m. We estimate that some 1,300 ha of
   pristine forest remains on the main massif between Gurue and Mount
   Namuli, but this area is being reduced by burning and ``subsistence{''}
   logging. Approximately 7,000 people currently live in the area east of
   the main forest. Grazing by goats and pigs on the montane grasslands
   surrounding the forests is another problem, but the gravest threat is
   posed by improved road access to the area, which could open the forests
   to commercial logging. In addition to being the sole locality known for
   the Namuli Apalis and the nominate race of Dapplethroat, the Namuli
   forests probably support the largest single populations of Thyolo Alethe
   and the well-marked belcheri race of Green Barbet. These populations
   make Namuli arguably the most critical Important Bird Area for
   Mozambique, and the remaining forests have a high priority for
   conservation action.}},

Abstract = {{The Javan Hawk-eagle Spizaetus bartelsi is endemic to the island of
   Java. Severe habitat fragmentation and small population size, aggravated
   by illegal hunting have put this rainforest species on the list of
   threatened bird species. Intensive searching since 1986 resulted in the
   discovery of a large number of localities additional to the historic
   ones. All known locality records of Javan Hawk-eagle have been
   scrutinized and are listed in the present paper. Confirmed post-1980
   records are from 24 forest fragments of varying sizes: to (including 28
   discrete localities) in west, seven (including 14 discrete localities)
   in central and seven (including 20 discrete localities) in east Java.
   The configuration of available habitat in forest clusters is evaluated.
   The co-existence with other threatened bird taxa, and the need for
   further field surveys and studies of the Javan Hawk-eagle are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi is endemic to the Caribbean island
   of Montserrat where, prior to 1995, it was widely distributed across the
   island's three main interior mountain ranges: the Centre, Soufriere and
   South Soufriere Hills. In July 1995, a long-dormant volcano on Chances
   Peak in the Soufriere Hills began to erupt. Since then the forest
   habitat of the oriole on the Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills has
   been devastated by pyroclastic flows and surges, heavy ash eruptions and
   rock falls. The Montserrat Oriole populations that inhabited these two
   mountain ranges have probably been lost. In December 1997, a census of
   the remaining Centre Hills population was undertaken to assess its
   status in the face of the heavy ash fall that occurred earlier the same
   year. To do this, a systematic grid of 140 sample points was overlaid on
   an area of 1,437.5 ha encompassing the Centre Hills, and a 10-minute
   count of all bird species was undertaken at 137 of these points during
   an eight-day survey period. The distance from the point to each oriole
   detected was measured and records of all other species were allocated to
   one of five distance bands radiating out from the point. Distance
   sampling was used to model densities, and thus to estimate population
   sizes, of eight bird species in the study area. It was estimated that
   4,000 (95\% CIs 1,500-7,800) Montserrat Orioles remain in the Centre
   Hills and thus the world. Although the probability of pyroclastic flows
   and surges overrunning the Centre Hills is considered remote, it is
   recommended that the Montserrat Oriole be classified as Globally
   Threatened (Endangered) under the revised IUCN threat categories because
   of its loss of breeding habitat since 1995.}},

Abstract = {{The Houbara Bustard on Fuerteventura uses cultivated fields (gavias) as
   feeding sites, finding in these a high-level resource of easy access. A
   total of 521 visits were observed during this study, 81 to abandoned
   gavias, 139 to cultivated, and 301 to ploughed ones. This use was
   correlated with the total vegetation cover, as well as with cover by
   herbaceous plants and by alfalfa Medicago sativa. The relationship with
   invertebrate abundance was negative. Cultivated gavias were selected in
   relation to their alfalfa cover, abandoned gavias in relation to their
   herbaceous cover, and ploughed gavias were selected in relation to total
   vegetation cover, cover of herbaceous plants, Launaea arborescens and
   Salsola vermiculata cover, and vegetation height. Figs, present in
   ploughed gavias only, were a highly favoured food resource. Of the three
   study localities, Lajares was most visited by Houbaras (357 visits),
   followed by Triquivijate (105) and Tefia (59) This use was not
   correlated with the population of Houbaras in each locality but with the
   resources that were found in them. The gavias were used in all seasons
   of the year, mainly in summer, and less so in spring. In summer, use was
   correlated with herbaceous plant cover and associated to the presence of
   figs, and in winter with herbaceous cover; in autumn there was no
   overall selection for variables; in spring, selection was negative with
   respect to invertebrate availability. This predictable food resource is
   a real advantage for the maintenance of Houbara populations and
   contributes to the conservation of the species on Fuerteventura.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was undertaken in 1995 to assess the conservation status of the
   Madeira Laurel Pigeon Columba trocaz, a threatened species endemic to
   the Island of Madeira. The first large scale survey was carried out
   1986, following the cessation of legal hunting of the species, to
   provide a baseline for future monitoring of population changes. The
   current study therefore aims to (I) compare population size with those
   of 1986 and (2) employ distance sampling methods (not used in 1986) to
   obtain estimates of population density and size. Eighteen transects (13
   repeated from the 1986 survey and five new) were conducted in the four
   main areas of laurel forest. Pigeon numbers had increased on nearly all
   transects but some of the highest increases, proportionately and often
   numerically, were in areas with lower numbers in 1986. We estimate the
   current population to be 10,400 individuals, a considerable increase
   since 1986, probably due to a ban on hunting. As laurel forest habitat
   is now very well protected the Madeira Laurel Pigeon is relatively safe
   from extinction.}},

Title = {{The recent distribution of endemic, disjunct and globally uncommon birds

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{191-225}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We surveyed the avifaunas of 24 forest areas in Kerala State,
   south-western India, over the period 1973-1997, recording 309 species.
   We give details here of distributions and status for all species endemic
   to South Asia and all those having isolated populations, disjunct from
   conspecifics in northern India (disjunct species). Most bird species
   found in Kerala that are endemic to southern India, or form disjunct
   populations, occur in forest habitats. Those species endemic to the
   Western Ghats (passerines), or constituting disjunct populations
   (raptors) tend to have more restricted occurrence than other forest
   birds. For the passerines this is because they are mainly confined to
   high elevation forests and grasslands: rather restricted habitats in
   Kerala. The raptors may be more dependent than other species on large
   areas of forest and hence may have suffered from recent reductions in
   forest cover. Current trends in forest clearance for agriculture and
   plantations and encroachment by settlers, threaten especially the birds
   of low and middle altitude forests. The present status of such birds as
   Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus, Great fared Nightjar
   Eurostopodus macrotis, Lesser Coucal Centropus bengalensis and
   White-bellied Blue Flycatcher Cyornis pallipes seems to be markedly
   worse than that described by Ali (1969) for the 1930s. These species, as
   well as Dollarbird Eurystomus orientalis and Black-crested Baza Aviceda
   leuphotes, are patchily distributed at low densities and may be
   vulnerable to extirpation from local areas. Higher altitude habitats,
   where many endemics occur, cover smaller areas, but are less threatened.
   However, some species occurring at low densities (Rufous-bellied Eagle
   Hieraaetus kienerii, White-bellied Shortwing Brachypteryx major,
   Black-and-orange Flycatcher Ficedula nigrorufa, Broad-tailed Grassbird
   Schoenicola platyura) may be vulnerable to extirpation or extinction in
   the long term. Kerala has a large network of protected areas (National
   Parks, Sanctuaries). Effective protection of those areas should be
   sufficient to maintain most species, although the coverage of low
   altitude forest is poor and remaining fragments should be carefully
   protected. There is continuous pressure on all habitats and bird
   populations will need to be carefully monitored in future if Kerala's
   endemic and disjunct populations are to be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Little Cayman, in the north-west Caribbean, supports a
   large breeding colony of Red-footed Boobies Sula sula, within a Ramsar
   site, the Booby Pond Nature Reserve, protected and managed by the
   National Trust for the Cayman Islands. Comparison of aerial photographs
   from 1994 and 1997 shows the colony area unchanged over this time
   period, occupying 16.5 ha. Area sampling yielded an estimate of 4,839
   nesting pairs on Little Cayman in 1997, representing c. 30\% of the
   entire Caribbean population for this species. Low mortality and
   excellent condition of chicks indicated a very successful breeding year
   with good food availability. Aerial photography proved to be an
   effective tool for determining the colony area but nests visible on
   these images did not correlate sufficiently well with ground data to be
   considered a viable basis for population monitoring. The 1997 census
   will serve as an important baseline, as Little Cayman is on the brink of
   explosive real estate development which is likely to have a severe
   impact on the island's natural resources over the next decade.}},

Abstract = {{In this study I compare bird communities along an elevational gradient
   in an Atlantic forest remnant (Pico do Corcovado in Ubatuba) in coastal
   Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Forests at low elevations are structurally more
   complex and more diverse in plant species than those along the slopes
   and at higher elevations in this remnant. Consequently it is
   hypothesized that low elevation forests contain a greater diversity of
   bird species. Results from the study in the Corcovado area show clear
   differences in the distribution of forest birds along the elevational
   gradient from both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The
   structurally more complex forest at low elevations contains the most
   diverse avifauna, including several of the rarest and most threatened
   species. The importance of this remnant as a whole is apparent due to
   the high diversity observed (254 species), the high proportion of
   endemic species, and the extent to which the avifauna is endangered.
   Protection of forests at all elevations along the Serra do Mar is
   required to maintain diversity of bird species, particularly the many
   endemic and endangered species restricted to specific elevations.}},

   by recreationists. It also holds a breeding population of the Hooded
   Plover Thinornis rubricollis, a rare endemic shorebird. We monitored the
   population of plovers over seven breeding seasons, 1991-1998. Mortality
   of nests (about 60\%), and of chicks (over 70\%) was high, but
   preliminary data suggests mortality was low in juveniles. The major
   cause of mortality of nests was trampling by people. The causes of
   mortality in chicks is unknown, but mortality was age dependent, and was
   highest in the youngest chicks. A combination of management techniques
   that have been phased into operation over the seven years of the study
   appear to be increasing the reproductive success of the population.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Grallaria antpittas are a group of little known birds from the
   understorey of humid forests of the tropical Andes, with several species
   having very narrow distributions. At Ucumari Regional Park, which
   protects the Otun River watershed in the Central Andes of Colombia, five
   species occur sympatrically at 2,400 m, including the recently
   rediscovered G. milleri, of which this is the only known population. We
   studied the patterns of altitudinal distribution, habitat use and
   abundance of the five species in the park. We found altitudinal
   segregation at a local scale, with two species, G. ruficapilla and G.
   squamigera, found at lower elevations (1,800-2,500 m) and two other
   species, G. nuchalis and G, rufocinerea, at higher elevations
   (2,400-3,000); G. milleri was recorded only in the 2,400-2,600 m range.
   The five species overlap in the range 2,400-2,600 m, where they occur in
   three habitats: early regeneration, overgrown alder plantations and
   30-year-old forest. There were no differences in density among habitats
   for any species; the five species used the three habitats in proportion
   to their occurrence in the landscape. Grallaria milleri had the highest
   overall density (1.3 ind/ha) while G. squamigera had the lowest density
   (0.2 ind/ha), and the other three species were intermediate. We
   estimated 106 individuals of G. milleri in an area of 63 ha, and only
   seven individuals of G. squamigera. The Otun River watershed
   concentrates an unusual number of Grallaria antpittas, including three
   endemic species, and the information presented here is fundamental to
   any future habitat management plans to ensure the persistence of these
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Dadia Forest in north-eastern Greece is well known for its diversity of
   breeding birds of prey. In 1980, the area was declared a wildlife
   reserve. One of the most endangered species at that time was the Black
   Vulture Aegypius monachus. To help the population of Black Vultures a
   feeding station was established in 1987. A monitoring programme from
   1984 until present indicates that the operation of the feeding station
   has coincided with an increase in the numbers of Black Vultures
   wintering in Dadia by nearly threefold, an increase in the number of
   breeding pairs from 10 to 21, and an increase in breeding success from
   40\% to a peak of 95\% A slight faltering in the continued rise in the
   numbers of Black Vultures in Dadia is attributed to a poisoning event in
   1995.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The winter bird assemblage and habitat preferences were studied in a
   largely arable landscape, dominated by winter cereals, in eastern
   England in one winter. A total of 32 species was recorded on 70 1-km
   transects but 11\% of transects had no birds. Overall densities were
   low, Skylark Alauda arvensis being the most abundant species. Bird
   density was highest in the first winter period (October-December).
   Species richness varied in proportion to the available habitat in the
   first winter period but there was a preference for stubble, grass and
   tilled land (harrow) in the second winter period (January-February).
   Skylarks preferred stubbles in the first winter period and stubbles and
   grass in the second winter period. Some 34\% of all birds fed on winter
   cereals despite a lack of preference for this habitat, while 94\% of
   seed specialists (finches and buntings) were recorded on stubbles. The
   areas of preferred habitats (stubbles, grass) were probably too limited
   to allow more than small populations to persist. Only by the widespread
   adoption of agricultural extensification and/or farming some of the land
   specifically for conservation benefits can the declines in bird
   populations on intensively managed arable farmland be reversed.}},

Abstract = {{The montane cloud-forests of the north-central Andes and the montane
   grassland and transitional elfin forest of the central Andean paramo
   contain a high diversity of bird species including several restricted
   range and uncommon species. Little is known of how densities of Andean
   cloud-forest species are affected by habitat degradation. Bird densities
   within pristine and degraded habitats at the Guandera Biological
   Reserve, Carchi province, Ecuador were recorded over a 10-week period.
   Densities were calculated for 48 species; where densities could be
   compared, 69\% of species occurred at a higher density in pristine
   habitats. Pristine forest had the highest species richness with 72
   species and paramo contained 44 species. In total, 26\% of pristine
   forest species were only found in pristine forest, 39\% of paramo
   species only in paramo, 13\% of farmland species only in farmland and
   there were no exclusively secondary scrub species; 47\% of species found
   in pristine forest, and 50\% found in paramo were found in both
   secondary scrub and farmland. Restricted range species recorded at
   Guandera included the Carunculated Caracara Phalcobenus carunculatus,
   Black-thighed Puffleg Eriocnemis derbyi, Chestnut-bellied Cotinga
   Doliornis remseni, Crescent-faced Antpitta Grallaricula lineifrons,
   Masked Mountain-tanager Buthraupis wetmorei and Black-backed
   Bush-tanager Uuothraupis stolzmanni. Three further species that occurred
   at Guandera of relatively local occurrence were the Grey-breasted
   Mountain Toucan Andigena hypoglauca, Golden-breasted Puffleg Eriocnemis
   mosquera and Mountain Avocetbill Opisthoprora euryptera. Of these nine
   species at least five used degraded habitats, while three occurred only
   in pristine treeline habitats.}},

Abstract = {{At the present time the earth is facing an anthropogenic (human-caused)
   mass extinction event that may eventually rival previous mass extinction
   events caused by drastic changes in the physical environment; however,
   the impact of this event on the earth's biotic diversity remains
   difficult to predict. Patterns of extinction and endangerment in birds,
   one of the best known taxonomically among major groups of organisms,
   showed that the distribution of human impact has been non-uniform
   relative to phylogenetic relationships. Fifteen major avian lineages
   differed over 35-fold with respect to the frequency of historical
   extinction and over threefold with respect to frequency of current
   threat; and overall rates of both extinction and threat were
   significantly higher in non-passerine orders than in passerines.
   Moreover, among both passerines and non-passerines, the rate of historic
   extinction has been significantly higher for species in monotypic genera
   than for other species; and in passerines, the rate of current threat is
   significantly higher for species in monotypic genera than for other
   species. Thus, the anthropogenic extinction and threat to avian species
   has specifically targeted species that are phylogenetically and thus,
   presumably genetically, unique.}},

Title = {{Is the decline of Burrowing Owls Speotyto cunicularia in prairie Canada
   linked to changes in Great Plains ecosystems?}},

Abstract = {{We examined population and ecosystem patterns hoping to inform
   conservation strategies for Burrowing Owls Speotyto cunicularia in
   Canada. The owls chose moderately to heavily grazed grasslands for
   nesting and roosting, and avoided cultivated fields. Where grassland
   patches were isolated in 90\% cultivation, owls dispersed later, for
   shorter distances and less often. Mortality rate during the 5-month
   study was high (adult ratio 0.45, juveniles 0.55), which may contribute
   to local declines. Additional mortality may occur on migration and
   during winter. We extrapolate from local effects (loss of grassland
   habitat with burrows for roosting, and similar to 2\% ``incidental{''}
   predation) to suggest that such changes detrimental to the owls occur
   throughout the central Great Plains ecosystem which the owls occupy
   year-round. The changes include ecosystem processes such as plant
   succession, owl dispersal and predation. These changes are likely to be
   irreversible on a scale that would be required to help this owl. The
   species may face extinction in Canada, at the northern limit of its
   range.}},

Abstract = {{Ornithological surveys were conducted in Tanzanian submontane forest at
   Nilo Forest Reserve in the East Usambaras and Nguu North Forest Reserve
   in the Nguu Mountains in July-September 1995. Information on the ecology
   of poorly known bird species of conservation interest was collected and
   combined with previously published information to assess their
   conservation status. Sixteen species of conservation interest were
   recorded during fieldwork, including five Vulnerable (Usambara Eagle Owl
   Bubo vosseleri, East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi, Amani Sunbird
   Anthreptes pallidigaster, Banded Green Sunbird Anthreptes rubritorques
   and Usambara Weaver Ploceus nicolli); three Near-threatened (Southern
   Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer's Turaco Tauraco
   fischeri and Moreau's Sunbird Nectarinia moreaui); one regionally
   Endangered (Southern Hyliota Hyliota australis); one regionally
   Vulnerable (Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird Anthreptes neglectus), two
   regionally Near-threatened (Lemon Dove Aplopelia lavata and Evergreen
   Forest Warbler Bradypterus barratti); and 10 in total as
   restricted-range species (Fischer's Turaco, Usambara Eagle Owl, Sharpe's
   Akalat Sheppardia sharpei, Red-capped Forest Warbler Orthotomus
   metopias, Spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Amani Sunbird, Banded Green
   Sunbird, Moreau's Sunbird, Kenrick's Starling Poeoptera kenricki and
   Usambara Weaver). New information on the ecology of these species is
   presented in this paper. It is recommended that the conservation status
   of East Coast Akalat and Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird be changed to
   globally Near-threatened and regionally Near-threatened, respectively.
   Should further work confirm that the Usambara race of Southern Hyliota
   deserves specific status it is strongly recommended that it be
   considered globally Endangered. All other species recorded should retain
   their current status and continue to be monitored. The Nguus represented
   a new locality for several species. Sharpe's Akalat, Spot-throat,
   Red-Capped Forest Warbler, otherwise widely distributed throughout the
   east Tanzania, were absent from the Nguus.}},

Abstract = {{Australasian teal consist of five taxa (Anas gracilis, A. castanea, A.
   chlorotis, A. aucklandica and A. nesiotis) whose taxonomic identities
   and relationships have been uncertain. Analysis of variation at 14
   allozyme loci indicates limited but clear divergence of New Zealand taxa
   (A. chlorotis, A. aucklandica, A. nesiotis), in agreement with previous
   studies of morphological variation. The New Zealand taxa are ``terminal
   and evolutionarily independent units{''} that clearly meet the criteria
   for specific recognition in line with the phylogenetic species concept
   (PSC). Because each is also geographically restricted and has small
   world population size, specific recognition supports increased
   conservation status for each. The three New Zealand species do not form
   a sister group with A. castanea, as previously hypothesized; instead, A.
   castanea and A. gracilis are sister taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of how avian communities are affected by human forest
   disturbance have given variable results. In order to focus conservation
   efforts we need comparative data for studying the relationship between
   community resilience and ecological predictability over much longer
   periods of time. This paper compares avian communities in mature forest
   and adjacent disturbed forest at a site in the Tanzania-Malawi Mountains
   which has probably had humid forest cover permanently since the
   Tertiary. At the same time the study presents a possible model design
   for such studies, which may be a suitable compromise between the needs
   for quantitative data and logistical constraints during exploratory
   visits to areas difficult of access. The method is highly time efficient
   as it is based on continuous recording of all birds during ``random{''}
   walking through the forest. There were at least 70 species in disturbed,
   against 61-65 species in different kinds of adjacent mature forest, but
   with a marked loss of range-restricted species as we passed from mature
   to disturbed forest. Most seriously affected were birds of the shaded
   forest understorey, but also the larger insectivores of mixed canopy
   feeding parties declined. These species search for food in the masses of
   epiphytic lichens, mosses and ferns in mature forest canopies. Comments
   are given on the specific requirements of six species of conservation
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{A group of villagers in Vanuatu are concerned that continuing
   development pressures are contributing to the over-exploitation of eggs
   of the Vanuatu Megapode Megapodius layardi. The Vanuatu Megapode or
   ``namalau{''} as it is known locally, is endemic to the country and
   classified as Vulnerable. Repeating a previous survey carried out in
   1995, the Vanuatu Protected Areas Initiative mapped and classified the
   burrows at three communal nesting grounds on north-west Ambrym in
   November 1996. The number of active and probably active burrows on the
   beach was low compared with 1995, whereas it was higher on both the
   raised promontories. The beach nesting site had recently been affected
   by a cyclone, and storm waves had inundated the area with the highest
   concentration of burrows. There is concern over the high percentage of
   megapode burrows checked by villagers at Buwoma, as well as the
   localized impact visitors could be having. Discussions with villagers
   raised useful points to be included in the proposed protection plan,
   particularly the support for a protected area.}},

Abstract = {{Between June and September 1995 estimates were made of the population
   densities of birds inhabiting fragments of unprotected montane cloud
   forests in southern Ecuador. The study focused on to species: Bearded
   Guan Penelope barbata, Golden-plumed Parakeet Leptosittaca branickii,
   Red-faced Parrot Hapalopsittaca pyrrhops, White-capped Parrot Pionus
   seniloides, Grey-breasted Mountain-Toucan Andigena hypoglauca, Barred
   Fruiteater Pipreola arcuata, Turquoise Tay Cyanolyca turcosa, Great
   Thrush Turdus fuscater, Hooded Mountain-tanager Buthraupis montana, and
   Mountain Cacique Cacicus leucoramphus. Species assemblages and
   population densities varied greatly between sites, despite the presence
   of similar habitats and altitudinal ranges. Substantial populations of
   the threatened Bearded Guan, Grey-breasted Mountain-Toucan and
   Golden-plumed Parakeet were found in areas previously unstudied, as well
   as in areas previously known to be important. Currently unprotected
   areas are important for the conservation of montane cloud forest birds.}},
