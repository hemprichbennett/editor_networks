Abstract = {{Count data suggest that Black Oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) has
   locally variable but globally stable populations. A simple, stage-based
   matrix population model for Black Oystercatcher was built and Monte
   Carlo simulations of the model were conducted using vital rates from
   peer-reviewed and gray literature. Simulations yielded a distribution of
   potential population growth rates that extended from 0.87 to 1.14 and
   was centered at 1.00, supporting the hypothesis of a globally stable
   Black Oystercatcher population. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of
   the population model showed that potential population growth is
   particularly sensitive to changes in hatching success (i.e., proportion
   of eggs hatched), fledging success (i.e.,proportion of chicks fledged),
   and breeding adult annual survival. These rates could be possible
   targets for population management should it become necessary given
   future changes in sea temperature, sea level, and coastal development.
   Pair productivity, which integrates hatching and fledging success, is
   suggested as a simple and valuable metric for monitoring population
   growth potential of Black Oystercatcher.}},

Abstract = {{The Red-billed Tropicbird (Phaethon aetehreus) is a seabird that breeds
   on islands in tropical seas. The Mexican government has listed it as
   threatened; however, the International Union for Conservation of Nature
   considers it of least concern, although it recognizes that its global
   population is decreasing. Its breeding ecology was studied at Pena
   Blanca island, Colima, Mexico, through monthly visits from 15 January
   2008 to 10 December 2009. By extrapolating density in a 4,227-m(2)
   survey area, 1,390 (2008) and 1,225 (2009) nests were estimated for the
   entire colony. In both years, the earliest eggs were laid in September,
   and the last active nests were recorded during 14 May-19 June, with peak
   activity on 7 March 2008 and 25 February 2009. Egg volume was not
   different between years (57.4 cm(3) +/- 5.1 vs. 56.8 +/- 3.3), but nest
   success was higher in 2008 (77\% vs. 57\% in 2009). Highest nest
   densities occurred between January and May, coincident with regional
   upwelling processes (colder water and high concentration of nitrites,
   nitrates and chlorophyll-a). The Red-billed Tropicbird colony on Pena
   Blanca is the largest Mexican colony and one of the two largest colonies
   of the world.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding distribution and population size of the Red-billed
   Tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) in Mexico were reviewed. This species
   has been confirmed to breed on 14 and potentially breed on six Mexican
   Pacific islands: two in the North Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of California,
   and six in the Tropical Pacific. The breeding population has been
   estimated to be approximately 1,901-2,725 breeding pairs. This estimate
   includes between 507-713 pairs in the Gulf of California, 1,391-2,004
   pairs in the Tropical Pacific, and the rest in the North Pacific. The
   largest colonies are Pena Blanca in Colima (1,250-1,650 pairs), Farallon
   de San Ignacio in Sinaloa (150-228 pairs), San Pedro Martir in Sonora
   (150-190 pairs), San Benedicto in the Revillagigedo archipelago (50-200
   pairs), Isabel in Nayarit (87-155 pairs), and Morros El Potosi in
   Guerrero (100 pairs). The portion of the population that breeds in
   Mexico is numerically important at both regional (Pacific Ocean) and
   global scales, representing approximately 50\% of eastern Pacific
   breeding pairs and 25\% of the global population, respectively.
   Therefore, protection of these colonies can play an important role in
   the global conservation of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Consideration of annual population count data, stream flows, water
   levels, and nesting habitat availability over a 29-year period suggest
   that Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalossos) nesting along the
   Cheyenne River and Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota, USA, select areas
   primarily in response to reservoir water levels early in the breeding
   season. Generalized linear models were selected in an
   information-theoretic framework and showed important relationships
   between adult Least Tern numbers and reservoir levels, as well as a
   negative long-term temporal trend in both survey areas. Reservoir levels
   alone could not account for the temporal trend. The number of adult
   Least Terns on the Cheyenne River was positively correlated (R = 0.668)
   with mean May reservoir water levels-a more important relationship than
   that between adult numbers and river levels. The number of adults on the
   Oahe Reservoir was negatively correlated (R = -0.573) with mean May
   reservoir water levels. Numbers of adults on the Cheyenne River and on
   Oahe Reservoir were negatively correlated (R = -0.684), suggesting that
   birds may interact as one population across the two areas. This
   information should help managers to consider ecological relationships
   among segments of the Least Tern population on the Missouri River and
   its tributaries and options for managing Least Terns on the Cheyenne
   River, Oahe Reservoir, and elsewhere on the Missouri River system.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{For migratory waterbirds, the availability and quality of suitable
   stopover habitat can affect body condition and demographic parameters
   throughout the annual cycle. This study investigates the importance of
   the Salton Sea, a large saline lake located in the southwestern United
   States near the USA-Mexico border, for migrating Caspian Terns
   (Hydroprogne caspia) fitted with long-duration satellite telemetry tags
   in the northwest contiguous USA. During fall migration, 100\% (n = 25)
   in 2014 and 98\% (n = 63) in 2015 of all tagged individuals were tracked
   to the Salton Sea, with median durations of stay lasting 36 and 25 days,
   respectively. Use of the Salton Sea during subsequent spring migrations
   was less consistent than in fall, but still substantial, with 91\% (n =
   23) and 68\% (n = 53) of all birds conducting brief stops there during
   2015 and 2016, respectively. The future of the Salton Sea as suitable
   habitat for fish and piscivorous birds is uncertain due to rising
   salinity levels caused by reduced input flows. It is also uncertain if
   other wetlands in the region can serve as replacement habitat for
   Caspian Terns and other migratory piscivorous species should the Salton
   Sea cease to provide fish prey.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying sexes in birds from visual observations could be a useful
   and inexpensive method. While sexual dichromatism and ornaments are
   readily used by observers, sexual size dimorphism can also be used to
   identify sexes in some bird species. This study assessed the
   applicability of visual observation of size differences to identify
   sexes in adult Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). Black Skimmers do not
   have sexual dichromatism; however, Black Skimmer males are skeletally
   larger (6.7-31.7\% depending on trait) and 33.3-37.5\% heavier than
   females. The study focused on two subspecies: Amazonian (R. n.
   cinerascens) and South American (R. n. intercedens) Black Skimmers. Sex
   identified by visually observing size differences was consistent with
   the sex identified at specimen preparation from examining gonads (R-GLMM
   = 0.996 +/- 0.004). The identification of sexes from photographs using
   visual observation of size had a very high within- (R-GLMM = 0.995 +/-
   0.001) and between-(R-GLMM = 0.984 +/- 0.002) observer repeatability.
   Non-invasive methods for identifying sex by visual observation may allow
   enhanced use of data from photographic datasets, citizen science
   projects, and surveys using direct observation or images.}},

Abstract = {{Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus; n = 3 breeding pairs) at the
   Shanghai Zoo, China, were used to study breeding behavior and nest
   conditions using automated telemetry from 21 February to 25 March 2011.
   Both sexes were found to participate in egg incubation, but females
   spent 341.7 +/- 180.0 min incubating while males spent 378.3 +/- 180.8
   min incubating during daylight hours. Females turned the eggs at 51.5
   +/- 22.8-min intervals, whereas males turned the eggs at 70.0 +/-
   64.3-min intervals. However, the differences between the sexes were not
   significant. The time budget of the Dalmatian Pelicans indicated that
   the breeding birds saved energy by reducing locomotion and increasing
   the time spent resting during the breeding season. The average nest
   temperature during the study was 35.5 +/- 0.8 degrees C (Range =
   33.1-37.1 degrees C), and diurnal fluctuations in egg temperature were
   small (F = 0.570, P = 0.942). The average relative nest humidity was
   55.7 +/- 4.8\% (Range = 39.8-66.9\%), and changes during the day were
   not significant (F = 1.347, P = 0.148). Therefore, ambient conditions
   had little effect on nest conditions in this study, but the sample size
   was limited.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of shelter to avoid predation and ameliorate
   physiologically stressful conditions is often important to the survival
   of avian hatchlings. However, as changes in habitat availability force
   birds to nest in nontraditional locations, young must quickly adapt to
   using novel sources of shelter. Two Common Tern (Sterna hirundo)
   colonies (one vegetated and one barren) were observed during the 2017
   breeding season on a remote island habitat restoration project during
   data collection for a larger associated study. While chicks within the
   vegetated colony sought shade under vegetation, those in the barren
   colony were frequently found under anthropogenically constructed chick
   shelters. The first reported instance of Common Tern chicks using Bank
   Swallow (Riparia riparia) burrows for shelter was also observed in the
   barren colony. This behavior, when paired with other similar reports,
   suggests that this species is able to recognize beneficial shelters,
   both natural and anthropogenic, and use them at a young age, an
   important ability if they are to successfully reproduce in atypical
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the special section prepared for Waterbirds from
   selected papers originally presented at a symposium titled ``Recent

   Annual Meeting of the Waterbird Society, 11-15 August 2015. The
   principal objective of this symposium was to explore and communicate
   about ways to address conflicts with this species that would result in
   fewer birds being killed under legal management programs. Fifteen papers
   were presented in three subject categories: population status and new
   research; knowledge-based challenges for Double-crested Cormorant
   management; and ethical, bird conservation and other perspectives on
   cormorant management. Three papers from the second two categories
   provided unique and important perspectives on ways to manage conflicts
   in which fewer birds would be destroyed and are presented here. The
   well-developed approaches in these papers are important steps toward a
   knowledge-based path to resolving conflicts and, most importantly,
   living with Double-crested Cormorants.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Abstract = {{In 2000, studies began on the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) in the Beaver Archipelago, Lake Michigan, Michigan, USA, and
   have continued through the present. Research was conducted to determine
   whether Double-crested Cormorants were preying on smallmouth bass
   (Micropterus dolomieu) and causing a decline in this fishery. Breeding
   Double-crested Cormorant population estimates were recorded to document
   population dynamics before management and throughout the intensive
   control program, initiated in 2007. Research included studies using
   telemetry, raft surveys, banding, game cameras, and development of
   several bioenergetics models. In addition, co-nesting species were
   monitored to investigate impacts of Double-crested Cormorant control on
   non-target species. Results indicated that Double-crested Cormorants do
   not negatively impact smallmouth bass populations, co-nesters or other
   components of the system. However, control measures were initiated and
   continued through 2015; litigation ended control activities in 2016.
   Research suggested that control led to abandonment by Double-crested
   Cormorants of traditional colony sites, a switch from ground to tree
   nesting, and impacts on co-nesting species. This review demonstrates a
   significant disconnect between science-based knowledge and chosen
   management practices. Although court rulings ceased Double-crested
   Cormorant control, this disconnect should be addressed and remedied;
   science-based knowledge should be emphasized in any future management.}},

Abstract = {{Lethal management of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalocrocorax auritus)
   has been implemented in many areas of the United States. In this paper,
   the philosophical method of argument analysis is used to assess ethical
   premises underlying the proposition that Double-crested Cormorant
   populations should be culled to reduce pressures on wild fisheries in
   the Great Lakes region of the eastern USA. This influential argument has
   been used to justify the destruction of more than half a million
   Double-crested Cormorants and hundreds of thousands of their nests and
   eggs. Three versions of the argument are formulated and assessed. It is
   shown that each of the arguments presupposes some form of
   anthropocentrism, an ethical stance considered by many in the scholarly
   community to be philosophically untenable and ethically inappropriate.
   It is suggested, consequently, that the arguments analyzed do not
   constitute an ethically sound basis for lethal management of
   Double-crested Cormorants in the Great Lakes region of the eastern USA.}},

Abstract = {{Tree mortality incurred through the nesting habits of Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) can cause human-wildlife conflicts,
   often resulting in the lethal control of cormorants to reduce local
   population numbers in North America. In a protected area in Toronto,
   Ontario, Canada, that supports the largest colony of Double-crested
   Cormorants in North America, a non-lethal management approach to
   mitigate cormorant-induced tree mortality was adopted by the site
   managers in 2008. Double-crested Cormorants were managed for space
   occupancy rather than population size, with the main objective of
   minimizing tree mortality while supporting the cormorant population.
   Targeted non-lethal deterrence of tree-nesting Double-crested Cormorants
   was labor intensive, but effective in protecting trees. Between 2008 and
   2016, the tree-nesting colony was prevented from expanding. Accessing
   ground-nesting Double-crested Cormorants only at night to avoid Larus
   sp. predation of Double-crested Cormorant nests appeared to be highly
   effective in minimizing disturbance; the ground-nesting colony expanded
   899\% over an 8-year period, with a 44\% decrease in tree nesting.
   Ground-nesting Double-crested Cormorants had less impact on trees than
   tree-nesting individuals, and this spatially focused approach allowed
   for the sustained existence of a thriving colony.}},

Abstract = {{The Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens) is listed as a priority species
   for conservation throughout much of its range because of a relatively
   small global population size and restriction to coastal habitats. Much
   of the previous research on the Reddish Egret has focused on the
   breeding season; subsequently, little is known about the winter ecology
   of the species. Satellite transmitters were attached to adult Reddish
   Egrets breeding in the USA in Texas (n = 30) and Florida (n = 5) and
   daily movements were tracked during the winters of 2010-2016. Reddish
   Egrets that were marked during the breeding season in Texas, USA,
   wintered at sites in Texas, Mexico, and El Salvador, and those marked in
   Florida, USA, remained resident. Habitat types used for foraging and
   roosting were similar in Texas; 48\% of roost locations and 63\% of
   foraging locations occurred on unvegetated tidal flats. In Florida,
   Reddish Egrets used different habitats for roosting compared to
   foraging. All Reddish Egrets exhibited a high degree of fidelity to
   wintering sites across years; 72\% of individuals had an average overlap
   of >= 63\% for roosting areas across successive winters, and 78\% had an
   average of >= 65\% for foraging areas. Average home range sizes varied
   considerably among locations and sexes and ranged from 39 ha (95\% CI =
   7-224; males in Florida) to 11,849 ha (95\% CI = 4,946-28,282; females
   at western Gulf Coast sites). This study provides new information on the
   winter ecology of Reddish Egrets that will aid in directing conservation
   and management efforts for the species.}},

Abstract = {{Sheldgeese {[}Upland Goose (Chloephaga picta picta), Ashy-headed Goose
   (C. poliocephala) and Ruddyheaded Goose (C. rubidiceps)] have similar
   migratory patterns, breeding in Patagonia (Argentina and Chile) and
   wintering mainly in the southern Pampas, Argentina. All of them are
   species of conservation concern in Argentina. The objective of this
   study was to estimate species densities using distance sampling and to
   calculate population sizes over three categories of habitat quality in
   the southeast of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Road surveys (9,200
   km) were performed from a vehicle during two consecutive wintering
   seasons (13 June to 6 July 2011 and 9 June to 4 July 2012). Predicted
   probabilities of sheldgeese occurrence were divided into three classes
   of habitat quality. Upland Goose mean density was estimated at 3.72
   individuals/km(2), Ashy-headed Goose at 1.62 individuals/km(2) and
   Ruddy-headed Goose at 0.04 individuals/km(2). Consequently, Upland Goose
   numbers were estimated at 348,255 individuals, Ashy-headed Goose at
   151,803 individuals and Ruddy-headed Goose at 498 individuals in the
   southeast of Buenos Aires Province. The results confirm former studies
   regarding the small population sizes of these species in comparison with
   historic data and suggest a decline in sheldgeese populations.}},

Abstract = {{Though an important measure for ecological studies, obtaining foraging
   data through direct observation is rarely assessed independently. Using
   field measurements (foraging habitat, food acquisition behavior, and
   food manipulation time), the summer diet of Whooping Cranes (Grus
   americana) in Wisconsin, USA, was determined; foods consumed based on
   foraging behavior were identified; and ingestion for Sandhill Cranes
   (Antigone canadensis) was assessed. Based on 102 observations, Whooping
   Cranes occupying six territories consumed 17 food items (verified with
   images), of which 90 samples from nine foods were modeled. Food
   manipulation time predicted food size: ln(y) = 3.50 + 0.45ln(x) -
   0.05ln(x(2)) (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001). Classification tree analysis
   identified consumed food using foraging behavior (error rate = 17\%). A
   schematic model with the same three behavioral variables and an
   additional variable of direct observation identified 93\% of 90 items.
   With Sandhill Cranes, observed swallows predicted actual swallows (y =
   1.12x - 6.18 (r(2) = 0.85, 95\% CI of slope = 0.79 to 1.45, 95\% CI of
   y-intercept = -50.55 to 38.19)). Field observation of diet and ingestion
   can be applied to any bird species that uses open habitats where food
   acquisition behavior and food size vary enough to inform models of
   foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Food availability affects the reproductive success of animal
   populations. However, food availability includes both prey abundance and
   its accessibility, which are regulated by different environmental
   processes. The match-mismatch hypothesis links reproductive success to
   annual variability in food availability, but the threshold hypothesis
   suggests that changes in prey abundance can reduce or intensify the
   effects of a mismatch event. From January-June 2011-2013, food
   availability and wading bird (Pelecaniformes) reproduction were measured
   amidst different environmental conditions at Lake Okeechobee, Florida,
   USA. Mean prey density was 165 +/- 21 prey/m(2) (2011), 87 +/- 7
   prey/m(2) (2012), and 104 +/- 9 prey/m(2) (2013) while 34\% (2011), 36\%
   (2012), and 77\% (2013) of the landscape became available for foraging.
   Two generalized linear mixed models were constructed to quantify the
   relationship between fledging success and total productivity using prey
   density and foraging habitat availability as independent variables. The
   interaction of prey density and habitat availability was significant and
   positive in both models. Fledging success and total productivity
   increased with increasing prey density, the effects of which were more
   pronounced when habitat availability was low. Saturation thresholds
   existed for both fledging success (147 prey/m(2)) and total productivity

Abstract = {{Habitat selection by herons, egrets and bitterns (Ardeidae) is
   influenced by the extent and quality of surrounding wetlands in natural
   landscapes. However, these relationships may be different in highly
   modified urban environments where inter- and intra-specific competition
   could be increased. To assess the relative effects of habitat and
   competition on habitat selection by ardeids in an urban landscape, all
   known colonies in the densely populated coastal region around Macao
   Special Administrative Region, China, were surveyed. The relationship
   among ardeid communities and patch-level habitat variables were
   investigated using multivariate and co-occurrence analyses. Ardeid
   species (n = 12) were recorded during 2006-2009. Habitat patches were
   categorized into three types based on 10 habitat factors using
   redundancy analysis. The area of adjacent open land (r(13) = 0.772, P =
   0.002) and patch area (r(13) = 0.670, P = 0.012) were the major
   indicators of species richness and abundance, respectively. However, the
   factor that influenced habitat selection the most was perimeter-area
   ratio (marginal effect:.1 = 0.33). The lack of evidence for competition
   in the co-occurrence analysis suggested that the spatial pattern of the
   ardeid community in Macao Special Administrative Region, China, was
   primarily driven by variation in habitat features that satisfy
   species-specific requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) undertake comparatively short
   migrations for a shorebird and were not previously thought to congregate
   in large numbers during migration. Superpopulation size (individuals
   occurring at the study site during the study period) and stopover
   duration were estimated for migratory Piping Plovers on South Point,
   Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, USA, from 3 July-28 October 2016 by
   integrating a Jolly-Seber model and a binomial model of resighting and
   count data. We estimated 569 Piping Plovers (95\% CI: 502-651) used
   South Point during fall migration in 2016, approximately 10\% of the
   global population and approximately 15\% of the Atlantic Coast
   population. Stopover duration differed between Piping Plovers that bred
   on or near our study site (Southern USA, 46 days, SD = 1.7) compared to
   individuals that bred in the northern area of the breeding range
   (Atlantic Canada, 41 days, SD = 2.0; New England States, USA, 44 days,
   SD = 1.8) and the central area of the breeding range (New York and New
   Jersey, USA, 26 days, SD = 1.4). South Point may be unique in that no
   other areas are known to host similar numbers of Piping Plovers during
   fall migration.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate which factors determined immediate
   mortality of Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) chicks during a heavy
   rainfall. On 26 June 2013, a heavy rainfall event was recorded at an
   inland colony of Common Terns in central Poland that resulted in the
   death of similar to 30\% of the chicks. The highest mortality rate was
   recorded in the youngest age group (1-8 days). Probability of surviving
   the rainfall increased 1.47 (95\% CI: 1.25-1.83) times with each
   additional day. There was also a positive relationship between survival
   probability and mass-size residuals of chicks (beta = 0.17 +/- 0.07, P =
   0.025). This study provides evidence for age-and condition-dependent
   mortality of semi-precocial chicks during an extreme weather event.}},

Abstract = {{Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica) comprise a group of
   cosmopolitan subspecies that make use of a wide range of aquatic
   ecosystems and have a broad dietary spectrum. This study documents the
   use of a southwestern Atlantic mudflat in Argentina and depredation of
   the southwestern Atlantic fiddler crab (Uca uruguayensis) by Gull-billed
   Terns. Gull-billed Terns preyed exclusively on male fiddler crabs. This
   may have been due to the observed presence of Gull-billed Terns mainly
   between 2 and 3 hr after low tide, when more than 80\% of fiddler crabs
   active on the surface were males. Gull-billed Terns spent 66.9\% of the
   time flying over and feeding on fiddler crabs. Gull-billed Terns landed
   without feeding 9.3\% of the time. Gull-billed Terns succeeded in
   capturing prey in 29.8\% of cases. Food capture rate of Gull-billed
   Terns was 68.9 items/hr, which is higher than rates reported for the
   species feeding on fiddler crabs in Mauritania and Guinea Bissau.}},

   than previously reported for shorebirds, particularly in Sanderlings
   (Calidris alba), which directed almost half of their attacks toward
   members of other species, mainly Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris

Abstract = {{Sarus Cranes (Antigone antigone) in south Asia breed during the rainy
   season (monsoon), with few nests initiated outside of the monsoon.
   Several hypothesis have been put forth to explain the unseasonal nesting
   outside the monsoon, but a careful evaluation of the hypotheses has been
   absent. Using a multi-year (2004-2017), multi-scale (four Indian states)
   data set, this study explored the factors potentially responsible for
   unseasonal nesting by Sarus Cranes. Nests outside the monsoon were very
   rare (0.3\% of all nests) and were initiated when Sarus Crane pairs were
   in areas with artificial water sources (irrigation canals or reservoirs)
   or faced abnormal monsoonal conditions. Unseasonal nests were initiated
   only when breeding pairs had been unsuccessful in raising chicks in the
   previous primary nesting season. Altered cropping patterns associated
   with increased artificial irrigation and changing rainfall patterns
   appear responsible for unseasonal nesting in Sarus Cranes. Nesting of
   this species outside the monsoon may increase in response to the
   increasing changes in cropping patterns and changing rainfall
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop tools for distinguishing
   between sexes of the two Blackcrowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) subspecies (N. n. obscurus and N. n. hoactli) using
   discriminant function analysis. Significant differences were found in
   length of the culmen, length of the bill from the gape, and length of
   the wing chord between the sexes of each subspecies, with males being
   larger than females. The resulting discriminant functions were able to
   differentiate between the sexes of each studied subspecies and between
   subspecies after determining the sex of the individuals (with a correct
   classification of 77.8\% for females and 97.8\% for males). In females,
   all morphometrics were greater for N. n. obscurus than N. n. hoactli;
   this was also the case for males, except for bill width, which was
   greater in N. n. hoactli. Wing chord length was the most useful
   measurement for constructing the discriminant functions. External
   morphometrics are a valuable tool not only for discriminating between N.
   n. hoactli and N. n. obscurus but also for sexing these subspecies.}},

   Foraging Habits from Stable Isotope Analysis}},

Abstract = {{Isotope data from Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) primaries
   P1 and P6 were compared to determine whether foraging habits change
   between the beginning and middle of the nonbreeding season. P6 data did
   not differ between samples derived from a longitudinal and a minimally
   invasive protocol and point samples taken from the feather bases. While
   P6 delta C-13 increased longitudinally, no delta N-15 longitudinal
   trends emerged, yet inter-individual delta N-15 variability was high. P6
   delta C-13 data suggest that Hawaiian Petrels molt at low latitudes.
   Among colonies, all of which are located in the Hawaiian Islands, USA,
   low P6 delta N-15 values for Maui birds relative to Hawaii and Lanai
   birds reflect foraging segregation and differential utilization of
   N-15-enriched oceanic regions. For the Hawaiian Petrel, the isotopic
   similarity between P1 and P6 indicates that analogous ecological
   interpretations can be drawn from these feathers, and similar foraging
   habits persist from the beginning to middle of the nonbreeding season.
   Prolonged inter-colony foraging segregation may facilitate coexistence
   of colonies and, together with high intra-colony foraging diversity, may
   reduce extinction risk for the endangered Hawaiian Petrel.}},

Abstract = {{The geographic distribution and populations of cliff-nesting seabirds
   are essential elements in the assessment of their ecological roles and
   status. Here, a geographic mapping approach was used to visualize the
   bio geography of European seabirds. This approach was conducted at two
   temporally separated time intervals: 2004-2010 was compared to
   1982-1988. Three bio geographic regions were identified: Arctic. Boreal
   and Ibero-Atlantic. The data show that species richness has remained
   stable over the approximately 20-year interval, as have, in general,
   population numbers and geographic distribution. Such stability, compared
   to recent declining trends worldwide, may be due to earlier human-driven
   declines in the European Atlantic, followed by effective conservation
   measures for the remaining populations. The species richness of
   cliff-nesting seabirds may not be principally determined by island area
   and distance from a large land mass, but rather by the extent of
   vertical cliff facade and distance from fishing areas. The stable
   species richness of each European Atlantic geographical sub-unit
   suggests that not only individual islands and mainland but rather the
   entire European Atlantic functions as a single large ``cliff seabird
   island{''} in determining bio geographic seabird equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Eleven of 15 species of cranes (family: Gruidae) are considered
   vulnerable or endangered, and die increase of agriculture and
   aquaculture at the expense of natural wetlands and grasslands is a
   threat to Gruidae worldwide. A reintroduced population of Whooping Crane
   (Grus americana) was studied in coastal and agricultural wetlands of
   Louisiana and Texas, USA. The objectives were to compare Whooping Crane
   movements across seasons, quantify multiscale habitat selection, and
   identify seasonal shifts in selection. Whooping Cranes (n = 53) were
   tracked with satellite transmitters to estimate seasonal core-use areas
   (50\% home range contours) via Brownian bridge movement models and
   assess habitat selection. Whooping Crane core-use areas (n = 283) ranged
   from 4.7 to 438.0 km(2), and habitat selection changed seasonally as
   shallow water availability varied. Whooping Crane core-use areas were
   composed of more fresh marsh in spring/summer, but shifted towards rice
   and crawfish (Procambarus spp.) aquaculture in the fall/winter. Within
   core-use areas, aquaculture was most strongly selected, particularly in
   fall when fresh marsh became unsuitable. Overall, the shifting of
   Whooping Crane habitat selection over seasons is likely to require
   large, heterogeneous areas. Whooping Crane use of agricultural and
   natural wetlands may depend on spatio-temporal dynamics of water depth.}},

Abstract = {{The Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens) is North America's rarest heron,
   and roughly 10\% of its population resides in Florida. Its dark plumage,
   subcanopy nesting, and rarity make it difficult to count with aerial
   surveys, and assessments of ground- and boat-based methods for
   estimating the abundance of nesting pairs at breeding sites in Florida
   are lacking. The efficacy of flight-line surveys (boat-based counts of
   adults flying to and from colonies) and direct counts (ground- or
   boat-based counts of nests) were compared using data collected by
   multiple observers during repeated visits to 16 Reddish Egret colonies
   in three core breeding areas in the State of Florida, USA. Detection
   rates on direct counts were 77\% for a single observer and 89\% for two
   observers combined. Variance between repeated flight-line surveys was
   high (61\% ) for 1-hr surveys but substantially lower for 2-hr (18\%)
   and 3-hr (14\%) surveys. Estimated nest counts from flight-line surveys
   were substantially greater than those produced during direct counts,
   with mean differences of 85\% for 1-hr counts, 134\% for 2-hr counts,
   and 133\% for 3-hr counts. Overestimates from flight-line surveys may be
   related to factors that can be mitigated by avoidance of sites for which
   use of the method is likely inappropriate (e.g., where breeding is
   substantially asynchronous or when a site includes an interior foraging
   lagoon). Survey recommendations are presented for monitoring the Reddish
   Egret on a large spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{In northwestern Italy, traditional rice cultivation using permanent
   flooding has been replaced by cultivation that uses a reduced water
   depth and a shortened submersion period. Prey availability for the
   numerous herons and egrets using this intensive rice cultivation region
   changed as well, with a diminution of amphibians and an increase of
   crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and oriental weatherfish (Misgurnus
   anguillicaudatus). The prey intake in 2014 was compared with data
   available for 1987 for the three most common species of waterbirds that
   forage in the paddies. Total biomass intake by Grey Herons (Ardea
   cinerea) feeding in the paddies decreased from 28 g dry mass/min in 1987
   to 7 g in 2014, and by Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) from 8 g to 5 g, while the intake by Little Egrets (Egretta
   garzetta) remained similar (12 and 13 g in 1987 and 2014, respectively).
   The observed levels of prey intake allowed breeding Grey Herons to meet
   their energy needs by feeding exclusively in the rice paddies in 1987,
   but not in 2014. The other two study species could not meet their daily
   requirements for successful breeding by feeding in the paddies only,
   either in 1987 or 2014. Yet the three species bred successfully in the
   study area, and their reproductive output remained stable both in 1987
   and 2014. Successful breeding was probable by the three species foraging
   in other habitats, such as rivers, small natural wetlands and irrigation
   canals, in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Body mass accumulation is a widely used measure of waterfowl condition
   and predictor of fitness. So far, however, post-breeding changes in body
   mass affecting autumn and winter condition have been largely unexplored.
   Here, changes in body mass of Pink-footed Geese (Anser brachyrhynchus)
   were investigated during an autumn stopover in Nord-Trondelag, Norway
   Average juvenile body mass varied from year to year, ranging from
   1,976-2,286 g and 2,154-2,104 g for females and males, respectively, and
   was affected by May temperature on the breeding grounds-a proxy for
   onset of the breeding season. Average adult body mass did not vary
   between years. During the stopover, juveniles of both sexes increased
   their body mass substantially (11.4 +/- 2.8 g/day), while adult birds
   showed sex-specific differences. Adult males took on an average of 6.1
   +/- 2.4 g/day, whereas adult females showed no increase during the
   period. One explanation of this might relate to sex-specific behaviors
   in the preceding brood-rearing period. In addition, arrival from the
   breeding grounds was earlier for non-breeders compared to family groups.
   Our findings indicate that annual variation in body mass, as well as
   body mass changes during an autumn stopover, may differ considerably
   between age and sex classes of Pink-footed Geese.}},

Abstract = {{Information about shorebirds is essential for predicting the impact of
   natural and human-mediated changes on their populations. Aerial and
   terrestrial surveys were performed to characterize shorebird abundance,
   spatial distribution and assemblage composition at Samborombon Ray.
   Argentina, during different tide levels and seasons. Approximately
   60,000 shorebirds were observed using the intertidal flats. Highest
   abundances occurred during austral summer, autumn and spring when
   Nearctic migrants dominate the assemblage. Significant percentages (>
   1\%) of the populations of three Nearctic migrants {[}American
   Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica
   ). and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis)] , one Neotropical
   migrant {[}Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus)], and two
   resident species {[}American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) and
   Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus)] were estimated. Large numbers
   of Semipalmated Plovers (C. semipalmatus ), Rufous-chested Dotterel (C.
   modestus ), and Ruddy Turnstones (Armaria interpres) were also recorded.
   Management measures aimed at maintaining healthy, viable populations
   should address species needs during all four seasons focusing on the
   southern and central sectors of Samborombon Ray. which are the most
   important feeding areas for shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{The nestling diets of four heron species breeding on a small forestry
   islet in Anzali, Iran, were investigated to determine the dietary
   segregation among sympatric breeders. Regurgitated samples from
   Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) , Little Egrets
   (Egretta garzetta) , Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and Squacco Herons
   (Ardeola ralloides) were collected during the breeding season from 23
   May to 16 August 2016. A total of 1,606 prey items were identified
   representing 39 prey categories from nine different classes. Differences
   were detected among these four ardeid species for the percentage of each
   prey category. Fish dominated the regurgitates of the Black-crowned
   Night-Heron (67\%; n = 43 samples), Little Egret (45 \%; n = 33 samples)
   and Squacco Heron (53\%; n = 10 samples), whereas arachnids and insects
   combined (53\% and 40\%, respectively, based on total number of
   individuals) and insects (61.9 \% based on weight) were the most common
   prey items for the Cattle Egret. Although fish items were dominant in
   Black-crowned Night-Herons, Little Egrets and Squacco Herons, their
   weight (chi(2)(3) = 318, P< 0.001) and length (chi(2)(3) = 225.2, P<
   0.001) differed significantly. There was some overlap in the diet of all
   four heron species, especially between Black-crowned Night-Herons and
   Squacco Herons, with a Pianka Overlap Index equaling 0.92. There was
   sufficient dietary segregation in terms of number, weight and length of
   prey items that could contribute to a reduction in competition for
   limited food resources.}},

Abstract = {{Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica) have historically demonstrated
   variability in nest-site selection and reproductive success throughout
   their breeding range. However, few studies have investigated the
   breeding parameters of Gull-billed Tern populations on barrier islands
   in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. The main objective of this study
   was to investigate annual variability of breeding population size,
   hatching success, and causes of nest failure during eight breeding
   seasons (2009-2016). Annual variation was observed in colony sizes
   (Range = 1-68 nests), colony locations (among five islands), and
   hatching success (0-93\%). Mean hatching success was 56\% and flooding
   was the main cause of failure, accounting for 64\% of all failed nests.
   Additionally, nest site habitat characteristics were compared between
   successful and unsuccessful Gull-billed Tern nests. Nest substrate
   composition differed between successful and failed nests, and successful
   nests were also associated with higher elevation, greater distance from
   the high tide line, and less vegetative cover. There was considerable
   variation in Gull-billed Tern breeding population size and hatching
   success, which may be attributable to the dynamic nature of barrier
   island habitats. Long-term monitoring is required to better understand
   the breeding dynamics of Gull-billed Terns, but conservation efforts
   should consider maintaining island habitats that are protected from
   flooding and have adequate nesting substrate, minimal vegetation, and
   limited disturbance from humans and predators.}},

Abstract = {{Research comparing dive durations and inter-dive intervals of

   Duck are considered the same species, we treated them separately to
   evaluate possible ecological differences. All three were observed at the
   same time in the same place in Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife
   Refuge, Puerto Rico. Dive durations and inter-dive intervals were
   recorded for Masked Duck (n = 60), Northern Ruddy Duck (n = 70), and
   West Indian Ruddy Duck (n = 445) from 1 January through 30 April 2015
   and 2016. The Northern Ruddy Duck had a longer mean (+/- SE) dive
   duration (22.9 +/- 0.75 sec) than the West Indian Ruddy Duck (18.8 +/-
   0.02 sec). Northern Ruddy Ducks likely had longer dive times because of
   their larger body size and migratory behavior.}},

   Clutches: Behavioral and Genetic Evidence}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral and genetic data were used to determine whether more than one
   female lays eggs in nests of the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis).
   Eighty-five nests were monitored, and 18 nests with eggs suspected to be
   from different females were selected. Both types of eggs were swabbed to
   sample for DNA since eggshells contain cells from the reproductive tract
   of the m other or the skin of incubating individuals. Using these swabs,
   molecular sexing was first conducted, and three clutches were discarded
   due to samples with a pattern of male DNA. In the remaining 15 nests.
   DNA was extracted from swabs (n = 45 eggs) and genotyped at seven
   microsatellite loci. The genetic diagnosis was developed with a blinded
   protocol including both suspected and non-suspected eggs by comparison
   of maternal DNA found on the eggs. With one exception, genotypes not
   compatible with the predominant female genotype in each clutch were
   found almost exclusively on suspected eggs, proving that the genetic
   diagnosis was not an artifact. Using a behavioral criterion, multiple
   laying females were detected in 21.1\% nests, but genetic data showed
   that the behavior methodology should be modified. In the 15 nests
   analyzed, die behavioral criterion failed to detect one suspected egg in
   one nest (\#11) (false negative) and indicated two suspected eggs in two
   nests (\#12 and \#13) that were not confirmed using the genetic
   criterion (false positives). The results showed that estimates based
   solely on the behavior approach can be biased, and the genetic method
   should be applied to check and improve ecological data.}},

Abstract = {{The Masked Finfoot (Heliopais personatus) has a global population
   estimated at 1,000 individuals, but very little is known about its
   ecology. Therefore, the nesting ecology of the Masked Finfoot was
   studied in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh between 2011 and 2014, and
   compared to nesting observations from the same area made in 2004. A
   total of 25 nests were detected in 2011-2014: 56\% (n = 14) on blinding
   mangrove (Excoecaria agallocha), 36\% (n = 9) on sundri (Heritiera
   fomes) and 8\% (n = 2) on cannonball mangrove (Xylocarpus granatum).
   Factor analysis revealed that 2004 nest characteristics differed from
   subsequent years. The 2011-2014 nests were built on the periphery of
   vegetation along narrow creeks of 12.66 +/- 3.54 m and located 1.78 +/-
   0.53 m above water level at high tide. Diameter of nesting tree (2004 =
   16.68 +/- 5.82, 2011-2014 = 34.19 +/- 3.96), nest depth (2004 = 16.88
   +/- 3.09, 2011-2014 = 13.28 +/- 3.32) and creek width (2004 = 21.26 +/-
   9.09, 2011-2014 = 12.66 +/- 3.54) was significantly different between
   2004 and 2011-2014. Reasons for changes in nesting locations are
   important to determine given the conservation status of the species and
   altering conditions in the Sundarbans.}},

Abstract = {{Precise sampling and observational techniques are fundamental to the
   management and conservation of many bird species. An array of camera
   traps (n = 15) was deployed to collect information on a poorly known
   wetland bird, Lewin's Rail (Tasmanian) (Lewinia pectoralis brachipus) on
   Tasman Island, Australia, from 25 August 2012 to 10 June 2013. Using
   camera traps located to maximize detection probability, images from
   1,213 camera events quantified Lewin's Rail occurrence and temporal
   variation in activity. Observations of social organization and behavior,
   agonistic behavior, foraging, relations within family groups, breeding
   activity, and diel activity were recorded. Lewin's Rail behavior was
   documented for a total of 294 days (n = 3,975 camera trap days). This
   study demonstrates the effectiveness of camera traps as a tool for
   studying secretive ground-dwelling birds. Although camera traps cannot
   replace other avian survey methods, they provide a complementary method
   for collecting behavioral data on Lewin's Rail and other ecologically
   similar species.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are altering the phenology of critical life history events,
   including migration, in response to the effects of global climate
   change. Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) are one of the most critically
   endangered birds in the world. Their remnant population, referred to as
   the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population, numbers between 300-400 individuals
   and migrates between the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast and north-central
   Canada twice each year. Previous analyses suggested Whooping Crane
   migration was temporally constant in spring and fall. New analyses of
   observations spanning 1942-2016 show Whooping Crane migration is now
   occurring earlier in spring by approximately 22 days and later in fall
   by approximately 21 days. Spring temperatures have also increased in the
   migration corridor during the same period; however, there is no apparent
   temperature pattern during the fall. In spring, earlier migrating
   Whooping Cranes stopped over for longer periods of time compared to
   late-migrating cranes. This result may be partially explained by single
   Whooping Cranes migrating with earlier migrating Sandhill Cranes
   (Antigone canadensis). These results have important conservation
   implications as the timing of Whooping Crane migration and availability
   of the habitat and foraging resources, including those associated with
   agriculture, on which this species relies will be increasingly affected
   by climate change. Received 6 February 2017, accepted 9 March 2017.}},

Abstract = {{The American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is an iconic
   waterbird breeding in the Prairie Pothole and Upper Midwest Regions of
   North America. Significant variation in recruitment occurs among years.
   However, mechanisms affecting recruitment, such as variation in size at
   hatching and chick growth, have not been quantified. In this study, size
   at hatching and growth rates of American White Pelican chicks were
   examined at Mash Lake, Minnesota, USA, during 2010-2012. On the day of
   hatch, the mass and lengths of tarsus, wing and culmen were recorded for
   the oldest chick in 2-egg nests. No difference was detected in skeletal
   size at hatching during 2010-2012, but mass of chicks was 11\% lower in
   2010 than in 2011. Growth rates for mass and wing did not differ between
   2011 and 2012, but over 40\% of the variation in absolute and
   instantaneous (relative) growth rates of tarsus was explained by year,
   with higher rates in 2011; in 2011, nest initiations were started later
   than other years. Little variation in size at hatching or growth rates
   were detected between years, but significant variation in size at
   hatching and growth rates were detected within season depending on the
   timing of hatch. No difference was detected in initial mass throughout
   the nesting season, but initial tarsus and wing length were shorter in
   chicks hatched later in the season in 2012. However, absolute and
   instantaneous growth rates for mass, tarsus and wing were greater for
   late-hatched chicks in 2012, potentially allowing late-hatched chicks to
   fledge at an earlier age.}},

Abstract = {{Brood reduction is a within-brood partial mortality due to sibling
   rivalry, and, in some species, the death of at least one sibling in the
   brood is almost guaranteed (obligate brood-reducers). Imperial
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) usually lay three-egg clutches that
   hatch asynchronously over 4-5 days. This species exhibits obligate brood
   reduction, and last-laid (marginal) eggs serve as insurance against
   early failure of elder (core) members. Within-brood sibling asymmetries
   were manipulated to analyze their effects on breeding success, brood
   reduction, parental body condition and chick growth. Two types of
   symmetrical broods containing three similar-sized chicks at the
   beginning of chick-rearing (3-days old) and close to the peak in brood
   reduction (8-days old) were generated to contrast the natural
   asymmetrical brood. Breeding success and parental condition were
   unrelated to sibling asymmetry levels. Asymptotic mass of fledglings
   from 8-day old broods was lower than those for natural and 3-day old
   broods. Our results suggest that hatching asynchrony favors early brood
   reduction and improves fledging condition. Regardless of asymmetry
   levels, Imperial Cormorants were obligate reducers, and the insurance
   value provided by the marginal chick was negligible. Therefore, the
   insurance value of the marginal offspring appears to serve mainly at the
   egg stage.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, there has been increasing interest in the application
   of ecological indices to assess ecosystem condition in response to
   anthropogenic activities. An Index of Waterbird Community Integrity was
   previously developed for the Chesapeake Bay, USA. However, the scoring
   criteria were not defined well enough to generate scores for new species
   that were not observed in the original study. The goal of this study was
   to explicitly define the scoring criteria for the existing index and to
   develop index scores for all waterbirds of the Chesapeake Bay. The
   standardized index then was applied to a case study investigating the
   relationship between waterbird community integrity and shoreline
   development during late summer and late fall (2012-2014) using an
   alternative approach to survey methodology, which allowed for greater
   area coverage compared to the approach used in the original study. Index
   scores for both seasons were negatively related to percentage of
   developed shorelines. Providing these updated tools using the detailed
   scoring system will facilitate future application to new species or
   development of the index in other estuaries worldwide. This methodology
   allows for consistent cross-study comparisons and can be combined with
   other community integrity indices, allowing for more effective estuarine
   management.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental approach was used to investigate wintering waterfowl
   responses to introduced trail use at foraging sites with and without
   recreational trails in California, USA. Waterfowl were exposed to trail
   use in the form of two researchers walking levees adjacent to ponded
   habitat, and the number of waterfowl by species were compared before and
   after experimental walks in 40-m bands starting at the levee and
   extending 200 m into the ponds. The researchers recorded distances to
   the nearest individuals, responses of focal animals, and numbers of
   recreational trail users. The most numerous species were Ruddy Duck
   (Oxyura jamaicensis), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), and scaup spp.
   (Aythya affinis and A. marila). Recreational trail use rates at trail
   sites averaged 1 to 82 people/hr. The greatest difference in numbers of
   birds before vs. after experimental walks occurred in the two 40-m bands
   closest to the levee at non-trail sites (0-40 m {[}t = 4.558, P =
   0.0001], 40-80 m {[}t = 3.775, P = 0.001]) and trail sites (0-40 m {[}t
   = 3.049, P = 0.005], 40-80 m {[}t = 1.808, P = 0.082]). The relationship
   between the ratio of beforeto after-walk waterfowl numbers vs. date
   since the start of the winter season (r(2) = 0.315, P = 0.102) and the
   total number of birds vs. the number of recreational trail users (r(2) =
   0.041, P = 0.847) did not indicate increasing tolerance to trail use for
   waterfowl overall. However, species varied in their tolerances. Ruddy
   Duck numbers declined with increasing numbers of recreational trail
   users (rho = -0.481, P = 0.017), while Northern Shoveler numbers
   increased (rho = 0.456, P = 0.025). Distances (using the 95th
   percentile) that individual birds were recorded from researchers during
   experimental walks varied from approximately 170-200 m at both non-trail
   and trail sites.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys for secretive marsh birds could be improved with refinements to
   address regional and species- specific variation in detection
   probabilities and optimal times of day to survey. Diel variation in
   relation to naive occupancy, detection rates, and vocalization rates of
   King (Rallus elegans) and Clapper (R. crepitans) rails were studied in
   intracoastal waterways in Virginia, USA. Autonomous acoustic devices
   recorded vocalizations of King and Clapper rails at 75 locations for
   48-hr periods within a marsh complex. Naive King and Clapper rail
   occupancy did not vary hourly at either the marsh or the study area
   level. Combined King and Clapper rail detections and vocalizations
   varied across marshes, decreased as the sampling season progressed, and,
   for detections, was greatest during low rising tides (P < 0.01). Hourly
   variation in vocalization and detection rates did not show a pattern but
   occurred between 7.8\% of pairwise comparisons for detections and 10.5\%
   of pairwise comparisons for vocalizations (P < 0.01). Higher rates of
   detections and vocalizations occurred during the hours of 00:00-00:59,
   05:00-05:59, 14:00-15:59, and lower rates during the hours of
   07:00-09:59. Although statistically significant, because there were no
   patterns in these hourly differences, they may not be biologically
   relevant and are of little use to management. In fact, these findings
   demonstrate that surveys for King and Clapper rails in Virginia
   intracoastal waterways may be effectively conducted throughout the day.}},

Abstract = {{Proposed oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska
   has raised questions about possible impacts of development on molting
   Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) and their
   habitats. We used GPS transmitters to record fine-scale location data of
   molting and post-molt White-fronted Geese to assess patterns of movement
   and resource selection relative to vegetation class, year (2012, 2013),
   and body mass at capture. Molting White-fronted Geese were located an
   average of 63.3 +/- 4.9 m (SE) from lakeshores. Estimated terrestrial
   home range size for flightless birds differed between years (2012 = 13.2
   +/- 2.6 km(2); 2013 = 6.5 +/- 1.8 km(2)), but did not vary among habitat
   strata or with body mass. Molting White-fronted Geese used sedge (Carex
   aquatilus) dominated low centered polygons and water more frequently
   than expected given proportional habitat availability, but avoided
   tussock tundra and wet sedge vegetation classes. Upon regaining flight,
   individuals tended to remain in the same general area, and the center of
   their home range only moved an average of 6.9 km. Greater White-fronted
   Geese that could fly tended to forage further from lakeshores (= 245 m),
   and used a larger home range (= 44.3 +/- 9.5 km(2)) than when
   flightless.}},

Abstract = {{Dam construction on the Zeya River, which is an important tributary of
   the Amur River in Far East Russia, has caused significant declines in
   water levels and frequency of floods in the adjacent floodplains since
   1980. However, an extreme flood event occurred in 2013. Populations of
   six crane species were monitored before and after these drastic water
   level changes at Muraviovka Park in Far East Russia, an important
   breeding and stop-over site. Individuals were counted by territory
   mapping during the breeding season (2000-2015) and by roosting site
   counts during autumn migration (2006-2015). The objective of this study
   was to evaluate whether changes in water levels had a significant impact
   on local and migratory crane populations. We found a positive effect of
   flooding on numbers of breeding Red-crowned Cranes (Grus japonensis) and
   White-naped Cranes (Antigone vipio), as well as on numbers of roosting
   Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) in autumn. Siberian Cranes (Leucogeranus
   leucogeranus) were only observed after the wetlands were flooded. The
   results of this study highlight the importance of elevated Amur River
   water levels for crane populations of global importance.}},

Abstract = {{Eight Agami Herons (Agamia agami) captured in the Marais de Kaw-Roura
   National Nature Reserve in French Guiana were tracked with Argos
   satellite transmitters in 2012 and 2013. While nesting, birds used a
   100-to 200-km(2) area around the colony site. After breeding, four birds
   moved from 280 to 1,250 km in different directions along the Atlantic
   coasts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and/or Brazil.
   Migration paths included one stop-over of 24 to 61 days. These results
   show that the Agami Heron uses large areas during the breeding season
   and can migrate long distances. That Agami Herons congregate from large
   areas into a limited number of potentially large colonies provides a
   basis for a conservation strategy for the species.}},

Abstract = {{Eighteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized
   from the endangered Black-fronted Tern (Chlidonias albostriatus), a
   species endemic to New Zealand. The loci were initially tested on seven
   individuals spanning the entire breeding range and then for a larger
   dataset of 345 samples covering 30 colonies from throughout the species'
   range. The number of alleles per loci ranged from 4 to 24, and observed
   and expected heterozygosity ranged between 0.46 and 0.95 and 0.45 to
   0.86, respectively. One locus showed significant heterozygote deficit
   and appears to be sex-linked. The similar annealing temperatures across
   loci and the wide fragment sizes allowed multiplex polymerase chain
   reaction and rapid multilocus genotyping. The microsatellite markers
   will be useful tools for further investigation into the genetic
   diversity, population structure and effective population size of this
   endangered species and for informing conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Visually-oriented predators, such as seabirds, are highly light
   dependent, and thus their presence and activity under continuously dark
   conditions of Arctic polar night pose a number of questions about the
   strategies and mechanisms they use to find prey. Here, opportunistic
   observations of the behaviors of Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia; n =
   4) and juvenile Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle; n = 5) were made in
   the ocean around Spitsbergen Island, Svalbard Archipelago, off the coast
   of Norway. These observations were made between 15-23 January 2014-2017
   during the darkest period of the polar night. Underwater observations
   recorded on 23 January 2014 and 19-20 January 2015 revealed that
   individual birds seemed to be attracted to artificial light. They
   actively foraged in the sea within the beam of scuba diver lights and
   harbor lamps indicating that artificial light may create additional
   feeding opportunities for seabirds present in the area. Other
   observations of Dovekies (Alle alle; n = 2) made on 15-16 January 2016
   may indicate that not all seabird species exhibit such an adaptable
   behavior. Various seabird reactions might be caused also by different
   age and intra-specific variation among individuals; however, due to the
   limited number of observations, future studies are needed to increase
   our understanding of these behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) is a migratory bird with
   many aspects of its ecology poorly understood. The objective of this
   study was to examine effects of fire, vegetation structure, and
   landscape variables on site occupancy and detection probabilities for
   Yellow Rails overwintering in coastal pine savannas of Mississippi and
   Alabama. Between December and April, 2012-2013, dragline surveys for
   Yellow Rail were conducted at three conservation areas: two in Jackson
   County, Mississippi, and one in Mobile County, Alabama, USA. Site
   occupancy for Yellow Rail was 0.81 +/- 0.06 (SD) with detection
   probabilities of 0.79 +/- 0.09 (SD). Yellow Rail occupancy related
   negatively with time since fire, indicating fire provides conditions
   attractive to Yellow Rail overwintering throughout the study area.
   Yellow Rail use of wetland and fire-maintained habitats within coastal
   Mississippi during winter, coupled with continued loss of open
   grasslands and inadequate management of fire-dependent pine savanna
   habitats throughout the southeastern USA highlights the continued need
   to prioritize the conservation and effective management of
   herbaceous-dominated ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Contrasting the general trend of declining Afro-Palearctic migratory:
   bird populations, the Whiskered Tern (Chlidonias hybrida hybrida) has
   recently exhibited spectacular demographic expansion and range shifts
   across its patchy European breeding distribution. To explore population
   connectivity of this species, individuals sampled from four sites in
   France, Poland, and Ukraine (n = 78) were genotyped at six
   microsatellite DNA loci and one partial mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene.
   Genetic variation was generally high (H-E = 0.47-0.67; pi = 1.29-2.26).
   Contrasting the historical absence of significant genetic structure
   (Phi(ST) = 0.061-0.027), the microsatellite data indicated strong
   differentiation between France and the Eastern European sites (F-ST =
   0.067-0.098). This, coupled with evidence of two distinct genetic
   clusters (K = 2; Delta K = 2) corresponding to little subdivision
   between Poland and Ukraine, has confirmed the presence of two European
   Whiskered Tern subpopulations (western and eastern) characterized by
   stark differences in wintering distribution and seasonal migratory
   routes.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma biochemistries provide a complementary method for assessing
   physiological and nutritional status of free-ranging wild birds.
   Triglycerides, total protein and alkaline phosphatase were determined in
   110 free-living Imperial Cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps) chicks aged
   16-35 days, at Punta Leon (Argentina) during 2010 and 2011. Body mass at
   30 days of age ({''}pre-fledging body condition{''}, 2010 only) and body
   mass corrected by tarsus length at the time of blood sampling
   ({''}current body condition{''}, 2011 only) were also determined.
   Variability of parameters by sex, hatching order, survival, age and
   breeding season was assessed, and the relationship between biochemical
   and morphometric indices was also explored. Morphometric indices were
   higher in A-chicks (pre-fledging body condition also varied with sex),
   and explained 35-55\% of B-chick survival. Biochemistries differed
   significantly between breeding seasons, being higher in 2011. Alkaline
   phosphatase increased with age, and total protein was higher in
   A-chicks. Triglycerides and total protein accounted for 26\% and 30\%,
   respectively, of variation in current body condition; however, they did
   not forecast pre-fledging body condition. Lastly, total protein levels
   predicted B-chick survival (higher levels in surviving B-chicks), but
   their prognostic value was relatively low. The results suggest that
   unlike morphometric indices, the biochemistries chosen are valuable to
   assess individual body condition at the time of sampling, yet their
   applicability for predicting chick survival requires further evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and abundance of wetland birds have been threatened. by
   increasing anthropogenic activities during recent decades. The objective
   of this study was to determine the effect of human-induced disturbance
   on bird species richness and abundance of natural wetlands in southwest
   Ethiopia. Bird surveys were performed at 56 locations during both the
   wet and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. Generalized linear modeling (G)
   was used to correlate species richness with environmental variables. It
   was found that wetlands with low human disturbance were characterized by
   a higher richness (n > 10) of wetland dependent specialist birds
   (depending completely on wetlands for food and nesting) than the highly
   disturbed wetlands. However, for wetland-associated birds (those able to
   nest and feed in wetlands as well as in other habitats), there was no
   significant difference (P = 0.31) in species richness between disturbed
   and non-disturbed wetlands. The abundance of wetland dependent
   specialist birds was significantly affected (P < 0.001) by human
   disturbance, whereas the abundance of wetland associated birds was not
   (P = 0.39). Fifty-three percent of the variation in species richness of
   wetland dependent birds was explained by a combination of water depth,
   sludge depth, conductivity, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, human
   disturbance and vegetation cover. It is recommended that anthropogenic
   activities should be minimized and controlled in and around these
   wetlands to conserve biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism and geographic variability in external
   measurements of the Grey-faced Petrel (Pterodroma gouldi) were
   investigated on the west and east coasts of the North Island of New
   Zealand. The applicability of morphometrics to distinguish the sex of
   individuals in the two geographic areas and assign a geographic origin
   to individuals was evaluated. Low geographic variation in morphometry
   was found, with discriminant function analysis failing to develop an
   efficient function to assign a geographic origin (55.9\% accuracy). In
   contrast, sexual size dimorphism was marked (up to 6.6\% different),
   with males being significantly larger than females in all measurements
   but wing length. A discriminant function combining bill depth at
   nostrils and head length correctly predicted sex of adult breeders with
   80.9\% accuracy (78.9\% for males, 82.7\% for females). Despite its
   apparent applicability across the entire range of the species, this
   discriminant function was not sufficiently accurate on its own.
   Alternatively, the use of bill depth at the base or a bill size index
   increased sexing accuracy to 92.1\% when both mates of pairs were
   considered. Thus, Grey-faced Petrels can be reliably sexed by taking
   only one measurement on both mates of a pair.}},

Abstract = {{Cormorants and shags (Phalacrocoracidae) are sexually monomorphic in
   plumage but dimorphic in size with males larger and heavier than
   females. Such size dimorphism has been capitalized upon for several
   species in the family to sex adults by using discriminant analysis
   applied on the morphometric measurements. Despite that, few studies have
   analyzed the development of sexual size dimorphism during chick growth.
   In this study, sex specific growth was assessed in chicks of the
   Imperial Cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps) by analyzing the development
   of body mass, bill length, head length, tarsus length and wing length
   measured on 80 chicks sexed by DNA based technics. Fieldwork was
   performed during the 2004 breeding season at Punta Leon, Patagonia,
   Argentina. In addition, discriminant analyses were performed to obtain
   functions to determine the sex of fledglings. Males had higher
   asymptotic values and growth rates than females for all measurements
   considered, even though the arising of dimorphism varied among
   morphometric characteristics (10-40 days). Discriminant functions to
   determine the sex of chicks at 30, 35 and 40 days of age were obtained.
   All functions included tarsus length and head length as variables,
   correctly classifying 88-94\% of chicks. Our findings show the Imperial
   Cormorant to be an interesting model for evaluating the potential
   consequences of sexual size dimorphism on chick survival and fledging
   condition depending on brood sex composition.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have applied induced regurgitations to characterize the
   diet of cormorants, but none have presented quantitative information
   indicating complete stomach contents were obtained. Our goal was to test
   the value of induced regurgitations for the assessment and monitoring of
   Imperial Cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps) diet. Stomach samples were
   obtained from male and female breeding adults bringing food back to the
   colony during the chick rearing stage (n = 22) at Isla Arce, Argentina.
   Samples were obtained through induced regurgitation, and immediately
   afterward each individual was flushed with sea water. The diet of the
   Imperial Cormorant consisted of at least 23 prey taxa, mostly fish
   complemented by crustaceans, cephalopods and polychaetes. However, only
   Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and rockcods (Patagonotothen
   spp.) showed a significant contribution by mass (70.7\% and 25.3\%,
   respectively). Analysis of similarity indicated that prey composition
   between samples obtained by induced regurgitation and those obtained by
   combining regurgitation followed by stomach flushing were similar in
   both the numerical frequency of all prey taxa recorded and the
   contribution by mass of the main prey. Our results show that induced
   regurgitation provides complete stomach contents, and thus validates the
   use of this technique for quantifying Imperial Cormorant diet
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Aechmophorus grebes are socially monogamous and copulate only on
   floating nests. Motion-activated cameras were used to study the
   copulation behavior of Aechmophorus grebes at Clear Lake, Lake County,
   California, USA, during 2015-2016. The sex of both partners was
   determined in 226 of 435 copulations; of these, 8.0\% were female
   mounting male (reverse mountings), including 6.4\% by Western Grebe (A.
   occidentalis; n = 171), 0\% by Clark's Grebe (A. clarkii; n = 31), and
   42.9\% by mixed pairs (n = 14). One copulation comprised two Western
   Grebes mounting a third individual on a nest; the sexes could not be
   determined, but most likely consisted of two males mounting a female.
   Another copulation comprised a male-male mounting by Western Grebes.
   These records provide the first documentation of simultaneous extra-pair
   copulation and male-male mounting in the Western Grebe.}},

Abstract = {{White-eared Night-Herons (Gorsachius magnificus) have been observed
   throughout their range, but their life history is still poorly
   understood, especially breeding parameters prior to 2007. This study was
   conducted on the breeding parameters of White-eared Night-Herons, from
   April 2009 to July 2015, in two artificial forests of southern China.
   All nests were located on two crossing branches of Masson's pine (Pinus
   massoniana) with altitudes ranging from 123-248 m. Most (88.9\%; n = 18)
   White-eared Night-Heron pairs began breeding in March and completed
   breeding in July. They consistently laid three eggs, hatching on average
   2.88 +/- 0.49 (n = 17; Range = 1-3) nestlings and fledging on average of
   2.17 +/- 1.38 (n = 18; Range = 0-3) fledglings per nest. Tree felling
   and human disturbance were the two most important factors influencing
   the breeding success of White-eared Night-Herons in the artificial
   forests. These results suggest that White-eared Night-Herons have a
   strong adaptability in breeding behavior in pine trees of artificial
   forests.}},

   Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos)}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Many bird species of conservation concern have behavioral or
   morphological traits that make it difficult for researchers to determine
   if the birds have been uniquely marked. Those traits can also increase
   the difficulty for researchers to decipher those markers. As a result,
   it is a priority for field biologists to develop time- and
   cost-efficient methods to resight uniquely marked individuals,
   especially when efforts are spread across multiple States and study
   areas. The Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) is one
   such difficult-to-resight species; its tendency to mob perceived
   threats, such as observing researchers, makes resighting marked
   individuals difficult without physical recapture. During 2015, uniquely
   marked adult Interior Least Terns were resighted and identified by
   small, inexpensive, high-definition portable video cameras deployed for
   29-min periods adjacent to nests. Interior Least Tern individuals were
   uniquely identified 84\% (n = 277) of the time. This method also
   provided the ability to link individually marked adults to a specific
   nest, which can aid in generational studies and understanding
   heritability for difficult-to-resight species. Mark-recapture studies on
   such species may be prone to sparse encounter data that can result in
   imprecise or biased demographic estimates and ultimately flawed
   inferences. High-definition video cameras may prove to be a robust
   method for generating reliable demographic estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Socotra Cormorants (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) are a regionally
   endemic, locally abundant species restricted primarily to the Arabian
   Gulf and coastal Oman. The species has declined since the 1980s and is
   currently categorized as Vulnerable by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature. Breeding phenology, breeding performance and
   variation in breeding population size were studied on Siniya Island, the
   largest colony in the United Arab Emirates. Laying dates were between 13
   September and 6 October during the 20112015 breeding seasons. Incubation
   was estimated to be 24-27 days, and clutch size ranged from 2.21-2.79
   eggs/ nest. Hatching success ranged from 58.71 +/- 5.85 in 2011 to 81.76
   +/- 4.86\% in 2012. The total population varied over the 5 years of
   study from 28,152 +/- 3,780 pairs in 2011 to 41,568 +/- 3,761 pairs in
   2014. Population estimates using density-area calculations were closely
   aligned with ground counts. The use of a drone with a mounted camera
   greatly improved the counts in 2015. The Socotra Cormorant breeding
   population on Siniya Island appears to be stable over the short term
   with annual fluctuations comparable to other cormorant species. Thus,
   our data suggest the breeding population on Siniya Island could have
   surpassed that of other colonies in the Arabian Gulf, underscoring its
   global significance.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A small colony of nesting Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens
   caerulescens) was discovered on the Ikpikpuk River delta in 1992. The
   number of nesting pairs averaged 35 (Range = 0-60) from 1992 to 1998,
   then increased dramatically from 176 in 1999 to 12,373 in 2015, for a
   lambda of 1.40 (SE = 0.138). Concomitant with this dramatic population
   increase, the geographic extent of the colony expanded annually from
   three small islands in the northwestern portion of the delta during
   1992-1999 to all vegetated deltaic islands in 2001 and farther inland on
   the mainland from 2006 onward. When colony growth was most rapid
   (2001-2008), nesting success averaged 79\% (Range = 48-97\%). Low
   nesting success during 2009-2014 (< 50\% in all years except one),
   primarily caused by brown bears (Ursus arctos), was followed in 2015 by
   96.6\% success. In 2015, 22,009 adults (in both brood-rearing and
   adult-only flocks) were accompanied by more than 25,000 goslings in July
   and August. These numbers represent a remarkable increase in the
   abundance of Snow Geese west of the Colville River, where only 15 years
   previously fewer than 500 birds nested. Both immigration and high
   productivity probably have contributed to colony growth, although the
   relative importance of effects of the two factors in this growth has not
   been determined. Further analyses may provide insights into population
   relationships and the management implications of rapid local and
   regional growth of Snow Goose populations in northern Alaska.}},

   support for this long-term study of Snow Geese on the Ikpikpuk River
   delta, Alaska. From the early 1990s, the North Slope Borough's (NSB)
   Department of Wildlife Management provided funding through National
   Petroleum Reserve Alaska funds available through the Alaska Department
   of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. These funds included
   support for ABR personnel, contracted aircraft, field logistics, and NSB
   personnel for design and review and some field elements (banding) of the
   project. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and ConocoPhillips Alaska,
   Inc. (CPAI) provided additional financial support for nest fate surveys
   and banding support in 3 years of the program. Debbie Nigro (BLM) and
   Caryn Rea (CPAI) were particularly helpful in providing support. We were
   assisted by the exceptional flight capabilities of pilots from a number
   of air charter services including Arctic Air Alaska, Pollux Aviation and
   Quicksilver Air. Sandy Hamilton (Arctic Air Alaska) participated in all
   years of our surveys. Finally, thanks go to a number of biologists who

Abstract = {{Discriminant functions based on external body size measurements are
   widely used to sex different gull species with great accuracy. However,
   all of them have been derived for adult birds, which puts into question
   their usefulness for sexing immatures due to possible changes in size as
   birds mature. To address this issue, discriminant functions that allow
   sexing of Herring Gulls in immature age classes with an accuracy of
   88-100\% were developed. In total, 247 males and 111 females of
   wintering Herring Gulls, including birds in the first, second and third
   winter plumages and individuals in adult plumage, were measured and
   sexed in the region of the Gulf of Gdansk (southeastern Baltic coast).
   In all age classes, total head length and bill depth were the best
   traits for sexing Herring Gulls. However, bill depth, but not total head
   length, increased with age. Hence, in the first and second winter
   plumages, total head length made a much higher contribution to the
   discriminant function than bill depth. In the third winter plumage, bill
   depth became more important. For individuals in adult plumage, however,
   the contribution of total head length and bill depth were nearly the
   same. Hence, using discriminant equations derived for adults resulted in
   erroneous sexing of 4.5-8.9\% of immature males, which were identified
   as females, and illustrates the importance of deriving age-specific
   discriminant functions.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery (i.e., shot, retrieved, and reported) rates and daily mortality
   risk of 52,330 adult Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) leg-banded during
   pre-molt, in-molt, or post-molt during 1985-2011 were evaluated to
   better understand mortality during wing molt in dynamics of the Mallard
   population in California, USA. Recovery rates and non-hunting mortality
   risk varied by molt status at time of banding and California region
   where banded. Mallards banded during post-molt were 1.22 (95\% credible
   interval = 1.10-1.32) times more likely to be recovered than Mallards
   banded pre-molt; recovery probability was similar for pre-molt and
   in-molt Mallards. Mallards banded post-molt had 0.43 (0.17-0.98) and
   in-molt 0.87 (0.51-1.49) times the daily risk of non-hunting mortality
   as Mallards banded pre-molt. Mallards were 0.92 (0.86-0.98) times as
   likely to be recovered, and daily risk of non-hunting mortality was 2.93
   (1.794.94) times greater, if banded in Northeastern California than in
   California's Central Valley. Results indicate that high mortality during
   the molt period, especially in Northeastern California where most
   Mallards that breed in California molt, might be negatively affecting
   recovery (and potentially annual survival) of Mallards in California.
   Thus, conservation programs that reduce mortality during molt could help
   attain the desired population size for Mallards nesting in California.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the implications of extreme
   tidal events on duration of stay and behavior of Semipalmated Sandpipers
   (Calidris pusilla) during migratory stopover in Cobequid Bay, Nova
   Scotia. This area is part of the Bay of Fundy and experiences the
   largest tidal range in the world. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor
   duration of stay of 30 adult and seven juvenile Semipalmated Sandpipers.
   Adults arriving in Cobequid Bay early in the migration period
   experienced a greater number of extreme high tides (> 15 m) that
   submerged preferred roost sites, and stayed on average 8.1 days longer
   than those that arrived later. Juvenile duration of stay was not
   significantly different from adults. When tides exceeded 15 m,
   Semipalmated Sandpipers engaged in over ocean flocking at high tide;
   however, this behavior was not observed when high tides were 13.6 m or
   less. These extra flights led to higher energy expenditure by early
   migrants, requiring an estimated 3.8 to 4.3-day increase in length of
   stay to reach the same mass as later migrants. In the future, predicted
   sea level rise could increase the frequency of extreme tidal amplitudes
   and result in greater energetic costs during Semipalmated Sandpiper
   stopover.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury biomagnifies in food chains and can lower reproductive
   success in many organisms, particularly in top predators such as Brown
   Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis). To determine and compare variability
   in mercury exposure in this species, chick feathers and egg membranes
   were collected from seven breeding sites located in the remote Pamlico
   Sound and the more human-impacted Cape Fear River in North Carolina,
   USA. The average concentration of total mercury in egg membrane was 0.20
   +/- 0.14 ppm dry weight, a level associated with slightly reduced
   reproductive success in some birds, while chick feather total mercury
   concentrations (1.13 +/- 0.02 ppm fresh weight) were well below the
   lowest observable adverse effects level. Mercury-exposure did not vary
   between the Cape Fear River and Pamlico Sound, but did vary
   significantly among three Cape Fear River colonies. Diet analysis using
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 revealed minimal differences in the trophic
   level and foraging location of prey between islands in close proximity,
   indicating that differences in mercury availability are not due to
   differences in diet composition. The source of mercury variation in
   Brown Pelicans remains unknown and in need of further study.}},

   investigated using individuals marked in North America between 1922 and
   2015. The results support recent genetic work describing three breeding
   regions (Pacific, Great Lakes, and Central Canada). Further., our
   results show strong migratory connectivity of Pacific breeders to
   wintering regions in central and western Mexico, and connectivity of
   Great Lakes breeders to wintering regions in the Gulf of Mexico and
   Caribbean. This integrated picture of demographic connectivity
   throughout North America should help in planning more effective

Abstract = {{Paired throat and cloacal swabs, along with feather samples, from
   nesting Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) at two sites
   in Illinois, USA, were tested for presence of invasive bigheaded carp
   (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) DNA. We also used DNA from the feather calamus
   to determine cormorant sex. Throat and cloacal swabs from cormorants at
   both locations tested positive for DNA from silver carp (H. molitrix),
   but none tested positive for bighead carp (H. nobilis).
   Hypophthalmichthys DNA was not detected on feathers. There were no
   significant differences among positive Hypophthalmichthys DNA detection
   frequencies between cormorant sexes. To our knowledge, this is the first
   demonstration of silver carp as part of the Double-crested Cormorant
   diet in North America. Hypophthalmichthys are major invasive species of
   concern in this region, the detection of water-borne environmental DNA
   of Hypophthalmichthys is an important monitoring tool, and the potential
   movement of DNA via piscivorous birds may have significant implications
   for interpreting environmental DNA monitoring data.}},

Abstract = {{King Rails (Rallus elegans) in the more northerly, migratory population
   that breeds in the Upper Midwest (i.e., Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,
   Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio), USA, are poorly studied due to their
   low abundance and secretive nature. A pilot project was conducted in
   2014 and 2015 to evaluate trapping efficiency and detection techniques
   of King Rails in northwest Ohio. The project site has held strong
   numbers of King Rails historically, but they are now rarely recorded
   during formal marshbird surveys. The objectives of this project included
   evaluating the trapping efficiency of walk-in traps in comparison to
   whoosh nets for King Rails and comparing secretive marshbird surveys
   with call-broadcast trap sites monitored by trail cameras for obtaining
   King Rail detection data. Six King Rails were captured using walk-in
   traps, and two were captured using whoosh nets. Whoosh nets proved to be
   more effective with a capture rate of 0.28 individual King Rails per
   trap night compared to 0.02 individuals captured per trap night using
   walk-in traps. Based on an estimated minimum count, 13 King Rails were
   detected in 2 years at established trapping locations (n = 147 trap
   nights) as compared to zero King Rail detections during that same time
   period while conducting secretive marshbird surveys (n = 84 points). The
   current secretive marshbird survey protocol may be handicapped for rare
   species with low rates of detectability because the surveys are limited
   on a temporal scale (i.e., only 10 min of monitoring per survey point in
   many instances). A camera trap array could be a viable option for
   developing occupancy models or even estimates of abundance for these
   rare species and further informing secretive marshbird survey data.}},

Abstract = {{A unique prey handling behavior of the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea
   leucorodia) was observed at Buclos-szek, a soda pan near Pusztaszer,
   Hungary, on 13 May 2007. The observed individual caught a large marsh
   frog (Pelophylax ridibundus), but was unable to swallow it immediately
   because the marsh frog kept spreading its limbs as a defensive behavior.
   Using its lower and upper mandibles, the Eurasian Spoonbill exerted a
   series of pressing movements to the head and body of the marsh frog, and
   then grabbed each limb with its bill and shook the marsh frog under the
   water to break the limbs one by one. Finally, when all the limbs had
   been broken, the bird was able to swallow the large marsh frog. This
   prey handling took approximately 10 min.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization within the genus Platalea has only been reported in
   captivity. A case of natural hybridization between two female
   Black-faced Spoonbills (Platalea minor) and a male Eurasian Spoonbill
   (P. leucorodia) was studied on a small breeding islet in Incheon, South
   Korea. The male Eurasian Spoonbill formed a pair with each Black-faced
   Spoonbill female during the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 breeding seasons,
   respectively, and laid 11 eggs in total, producing nine successful
   hybrid offspring. Two fledglings were color-banded in 2013, and one of
   them returned to its natal site in 2015 and 2016. The hybrids had
   intermediate morphology between Black-faced and. Eurasian spoonbills:
   larger body size and longer bill and legs than those of Black-faced
   Spoonbills, narrow band of black bare skin on the lore to the eyes, a
   small yellow naked chin and no bared throat. Received 18 August 2016,

Abstract = {{Monteiro's Storm-petrel (Hydrobates monteiroi) is a small seabird
   endemic to the Azores archipelago, where it is known to breed only on
   two mammal-free islets. Total breeding numbers are between 250 and 300
   pairs. During the 2015 breeding season on Praia Islet, six Madeiran wall
   lizards (Lacerta dugesii) were observed depredating a Monteiro's
   Storm-petrel chick about to fledge. In August 2015, a freshly killed
   chick without its head and four larger dead chicks were found. Eight
   other chicks had disappeared from their nests since our previous visit
   in early July. In 2016, there was further evidence of suspected lizard
   depredation. Three chicks were found predated and dragged out of their
   nests, and an additional 22 chicks disappeared from their nests before
   fledging. In 2016, Monteiro's Storm-petrel breeding success was only
   26.8\%, the lowest ever recorded. We suspect that some of the chick
   deaths and nest failures may be attributed to these introduced lizards.
   All chicks were found dragged out of their nests, a behavior that is not
   consistent with kills from aerial predators. Lizards were suspected
   because they are the only possible predator on land. Therefore, we
   recommend evaluating the impact of Madeiran wall lizards on the two
   Monteiro's Storm-petrel main colonies: Praia and Baixo Islets. Received

Abstract = {{The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) Working Group formed
   spontaneously in 2001 as coastal waterbird biologists recognized the
   potential for American Oystercatchers to serve as focal species for
   collaborative research and management. Accomplishments over the past 15
   years include the establishment of rangewide surveys, color-banding
   protocols, mark-resight studies, a revision of the Birds of North
   America species account, and new mechanisms for sharing ideas and data.
   Collaborations among State, Federal, and private sector scientists,
   natural resource managers, and dedicated volunteers have provided
   insights into the biology and conservation of American Oystercatchers in
   the United States and abroad that would not have been possible without
   the relationships formed through the Working Group. These
   accomplishments illustrate how broad collaborative approaches and the
   engagement of the public are key elements of effective shorebird
   conservation programs.}},

Title = {{Managing Native Predators: Evidence from a Partial Removal of Raccoons

Abstract = {{Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are important predators of ground-nesting
   species in coastal systems. They have been identified as a primary cause
   of nest failure for the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus)
   throughout its range. Concerns over the long-term effects of raccoon
   predation and increased nest success following a hurricane inspired a
   mark-resight study of the raccoon population on a barrier island off
   North Carolina, USA. Approximately half of the raccoons were
   experimentally removed in 2008. Nests (n = 700) were monitored on two
   adjacent barrier islands during 2004-2013. Daily nest survival estimates
   were highest for 2004 (0.974 +/- 0.005) and lowest for 2007 and 2008
   (0.925 +/- 0.009 and 0.925 +/- 0.010, respectively). The only model in
   our candidate set that received any support included island and time of
   season, along with a diminishing effect of the hurricane and a constant,
   5-year effect of the raccoon removal. For both hurricane and raccoon
   removal, however, the support for island-specific effects was weak beta
   = -0.20 +/- 40.116 and 0.146 +/- 0.349, respectively). We conclude that
   either the raccoon reduction was inadequate, or factors other than
   predation cause more variation in nest success than previously
   recognized. A multi-faceted approach to management aimed at reducing
   nest losses to storm overwash, predation, and human disturbance is
   likely to yield the largest population level benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital VHF telemetry is expanding as a lightweight
   alternative to satellite-based technologies for tracking bird movements,
   though few studies have compared how they perform. During 2013,
   satellite telemetry and digital VHF telemetry were compared for
   estimating the length of stay and home ranges of American Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus palliatus) on their breeding grounds in Massachusetts; USA.
   American Oystercatchers (n = 5) were captured at their nest sites and
   tagged with a 9.5-g solar-powered satellite transmitter and a 1.0-g
   digitally coded VHF transmitter, and tracked using the Argos satellite
   system, an array of eight automated radio telemetry stations, and
   periodic land-based and aerial telemetry surveys. Estimates of mean
   minimum length of stay in the study area were slightly longer for
   satellite telemetry at 118 +/- 12 days vs. digital VHF telemetry at 108
   11 days. Size estimates of mean (SE) fixed kernel 95\% utilization
   distributions were similar for satellite telemetry (22.53 +/- 16.87
   km(2)) and VHF telemetry (27.27 +/- 21.58 km(2)). Despite a small sample
   size, digital VHF telemetry, when combined with automated radio
   telemetry stations and telemetry surveys, performed similarly to
   satellite telemetry for estimating timing and home range size of
   shorebirds on their breeding grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of a species is reliant on identifying threats to
   critical vital rates such as survival and dispersal. Accurate estimates
   of these vital rates and the factors that affect them can be used to
   better manage populations. The USA Atlantic Coast population of American
   Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) benefits from a large-scale
   conservation effort, but this long-lived species remains especially
   sensitive to fluctuations in adult survival. The model used here and 8
   years of mark-resight data from three breeding populations with varying
   migration strategies from the United States (migratory: Massachusetts
   and New Jersey; non-migratory: South Carolina) were used to estimate
   adult survival and site fidelity. Results indicated a resident
   population in South Carolina with 100\% of the breeding population
   wintering in that State, a migratory population in Massachusetts with
   the majority of individuals wintering in Florida (42\%), and a partially
   migratory population in New Jersey with a portion of the breeding
   population overwintering in that State (33\%). Annual adult survival did
   not vary among populations. Although the average estimate of adult
   survival was high (0.89), there was an apparent decline in adult
   survival (from 0.94 to 0.83) over the study period. Given strong site
   fidelity (0.91), adult mortality is a critical factor for the viability
   of local populations.}},

Abstract = {{In populations of long-lived species, adult survival typically has a
   relatively high influence on population growth. From a management
   perspective, however, adult survival can be difficult to increase in
   some instances, so other component rates must be considered to reverse
   population declines. In North Carolina, USA, management to conserve the
   American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) targets component vital
   rates related to fecundity, specifically nest and chick survival. The
   effectiveness of such a management approach in North Carolina was
   assessed by creating a three-stage female-based deterministic matrix
   model. Isoclines were produced from the matrix model to evaluate minimum
   nest and chick survival rates necessary to reverse population decline,
   assuming all other vital rates remained stable at mean values. Assuming
   accurate vital rates, breeding populations within North Carolina appear
   to be declining. To reverse this decline, combined nest and chick
   survival would need to increase from 0.14 to >= 0.27, a rate that
   appears to be attainable based on historical estimates. Results are
   heavily dependent on assumptions of other vital rates, most notably
   adult survival, revealing the need for accurate estimates of all vital
   rates to inform management actions. This approach provides valuable
   insights for evaluating conservation goals for species of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Information on demographic parameters needed to inform conservation
   strategies for American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) is
   lacking. The population dynamics of American Oystercatchers in Virginia,
   USA, were examined using a multi-state analysis framework that modeled
   movement of American Oystercatchers into and out of the State. Change in
   breeding status, age-specific survival rates, and age at first breeding
   were investigated for three geographically distinct study sites.
   Non-breeding American Oystercatchers originating from Virginia readily
   moved in and out of the State among years. The immigration rate for
   birds breeding on barrier islands was 6\%. Emigration rates were 6\% for
   the barrier island breeding population and 17\% for the seaside lagoon
   population. Stage-specific annual survival rates were 0.66, 0.95 and
   0.91 for juvenile, sub-adult and adult stages, respectively. Age at
   first breeding peaked in the fourth year for both the barrier island and
   seaside lagoon breeding populations. Movement and recruitment rates
   suggested that the barrier islands may provide the highest quality
   breeding habitat among the three study sites. This study showed that
   Virginia's American Oystercatcher population is linked with other
   Atlantic Coast populations, and these links should be considered when
   evaluating local population trends and management targets.}},

Abstract = {{The western race of the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus
   frazan) is a resident and endangered shorebird of western Mexico. Its
   breeding population and conservation concerns are poorly known, but
   recent information indicates extremely low numbers and a discrete
   breeding distribution. Because of loss and degradation of sandy beaches
   by coastal development and disturbance from human recreational
   activities, the American Oystercatcher is a priority species in the
   Shorebird Conservation Plans of the United States and Mexico. Research
   on its distribution and abundance during the 2009 breeding season
   resulted in the identification of 2,286 adults in northwest Mexico.
   Although the population is higher than previous estimates, its
   distribution is more restricted than expected. It is distributed almost
   exclusively in northwest Mexico, and 80\% of the total breeding
   population is found on the islands of Sinaloa and Baja California Sur.
   Based on these results, this species was officially federally listed on
   the Mexican List of Protected Species in 2010. This legal mechanism will
   promote the management and protection of this priority subspecies as
   well as other waterbirds occupying the same habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Atlantic population of the American Oystercatcher
   (Haematopus palliatus) is of conservation concern, and much effort has
   been exerted to determine impacts of conservation efforts and identify
   important sites that need increased protection within the breeding
   range. Monitorihg numbers of nesting pairs and distribution and habitat
   selection of nesting pairs provides data for conservation programs. The
   breeding population of American Oystercatchers in North Carolina has
   been estimated four times since 2004. Locations of territories and nests
   were recorded and mapped, and sites were categorized according to
   habitat type (barrier, dredged-material, or natural sand-shell or marsh
   island) and management responsibility (Federal, State, Audubon North
   Carolina, private landowner). Estimates indicate the number of nesting
   pairs changed slightly: 324 in 2004, 346 in 2007, 373 in 2010, and 351
   in 2013. Total numbers of individual American Oystercatchers during the
   breeding season changed from 703 in 2004 to 802 in 2013. Most nesting
   pairs (159.0 +/- 6.0 SE; P <= 0.001) are on barrier islands under
   Federal agency management, followed by nesting pairs on natural islands
   (117.0 +/- 7.2) and dredged material islands (69.5 +/- 6.3).}},

Abstract = {{American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) are present in North
   Carolina, USA, year-round. About 6-7\% of the total Western Atlantic
   population winters in North Carolina. To estimate numbers of American
   Oystercatchers present during the non-breeding season, four major
   concentration areas were surveyed in North Carolina, each with multiple
   roost sites, from 2008-2013. Abundance of American Oystercatchers
   remained generally stable during the study period. The Lower Cape Fear
   River area had the greatest number of American Oystercatchers in all
   seasons. Mean peak abundance was greatest during winter at all
   concentration areas. Peak winter abundance was 158 at Ocracoke Inlet,
   265 in Back Sound, 187 in Masonboro Sound, and 470 on the Lower Cape
   Fear River. Fall abundance was generally greater than spring abundance
   at all concentration areas except Masonboro Sound. Most banded
   individuals observed were marked in North Carolina as chicks or nesting
   adults, and they exhibited fidelity to concentration areas. About 15\%
   of American Oystercatchers used wooden docks as roost sites; the rest
   used natural substrates and a man-made rock wall. At sites where roost
   habitat is a limiting factor, fabricated structures might be a useful
   substitute. Most roost sites receive no protection during the
   non-breeding season, and we observed sources of potential disturbance on
   2.8-50.6\% of surveys. Pedestrians and boats were the most common
   sources of potential disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus frazarz) is federally
   listed as endangered in Mexico due to habitat loss and small population
   size. Recent surveys indicate that the State of Sinaloa supports about
   half of the breeding population in Mexico. However, no information is
   available about the non-breeding ecology in Mexico. To assess American
   Oystercatcher distribution, abundance, and roosting habitat use during
   the non breeding season (3 August 2014-23 January 2015), six bays were
   surveyed in Sinaloa. A total of 1,351 American Oystercatchers were
   detected using this area based on maximum count per roosting site at or
   near high tide. American Oystercatchers roosted in flocks of variable
   size (3-253 individuals per flock) with Bahia Santa Maria hosting the
   main roosting sites in Sinaloa. Mangrove islands and mudflats had larger
   numbers of individuals than expected relative to the availability of
   those habitats. The non-breeding Sinaloa population comprised
   approximately 45.0\% of the total H. p. frazari population estimate (n =
   3,000 individuals). Bahia Santa Maria represented 74.6\% of the
   non-breeding population observed in Sinaloa. Thus, Sinaloa, and
   particularly Bahia Santa Maria, stand out as critical sites for the
   conservation of this subspecies. Hypothesized threats to American
   Oystercatchers were predators, livestock, and human activities.}},

   Distribution in an Urbanized Coastal Ecosystem Using Maximum Entropy

Abstract = {{Species distribution modeling has seen widespread use in ecology and
   conservation over the past two decades, and as a result many questions
   regarding the predictive capabilities of new techniques have been
   raised. One modeling approach that has gained popularity is Maxent,
   which uses presence-only data to model species distributions. Although
   Maxent is ordinarily used to model a species' fundamental niche at large
   scales (e.g., continental-scale), this technique was used to develop a
   predictive model for the realized niche and local breeding distribution
   of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) in coastal New Jersey,
   USA. The transferability of the predictive model to locations outside
   training areas was examined in an effort to locate new breeding
   populations in previously unsurveyed areas. Initial model validation
   indicated that Maxent performed well, exhibiting good discrimination
   ability based on analyses of both training data (AUC = 0.95) and test
   data (AUC = 0.91). Ground surveys based on the final model located 185
   previously unknown territorial pairs of American Oystercatchers, showing
   that Maxent was useful to locate new populations in alternative breeding
   habitats. However, when validated with an independent dataset, the
   Maxent model did not perform much better than random (AUC = 0.54),
   reporting high omission (0.76-0.93) and commission (0.40-0.83) error
   rates. The poor validation was attributed to source-sink dynamics rather
   than to errors in the modeling technique. Future researchers attempting
   to validate species distribution models with ground surveys should take
   into consideration metapopulation and source-sink theory in the design
   of surveys and interpretation of results. Received 1 October 2015,
   accepted 23 June 2016.}},

Abstract = {{Over the course of a 6-year study of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus
   palliatus), five cases of entanglement in monofilament fishing line were
   encountered. Two cases resulted in confirmed death, one case resulted in
   probable death, and two cases resulted in survival but required human
   intervention. Approximately 2-4\% of the study population was
   represented in these events, which is cause for alarm as monofilament
   fishing line is a hazard both to American Oystercatchers and other
   species. This report emphasizes the need for careful responsibility by
   recreational users of fishing tackle, educational programs to stress
   this need, and signage to reinforce this message. Received 16 June 2016,
   accepted 11 July 2016.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from human activity,
   introduced species, sea level rise, and storm activity. Hurricanes are a
   powerful destructive force, but can also renew coastal habitats. In
   2003, Hurricane Isabel altered the barrier islands of North Carolina,
   flattening dunes and creating sand flats. American Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus palliatus) are large shorebirds that inhabit the coastal
   zone throughout the year. Alternative survival models were evaluated for
   699 American Oystercatcher nests on North Core Banks and South Core
   Banks, North Carolina, USA, from 1999-2007. Nest survival on North Core
   Banks increased from 0.170 (SE = 0.002) to 0.772 (SE = 0.090) after the
   hurricane, with a carry-over effect lasting 2 years. A simple year
   effects model described nest survival on South Core Banks. Habitat had
   no effect on survival except when the overall rate of nest survival was
   at intermediate levels (0.300-0.600), when nests on open flats survived
   at a higher rate (0.600; SE = 0.112) than nests in dune habitat (0.243;
   SE = 0.094). Predator activity declined on North Core Banks after the
   hurricane and corresponded with an increase in nest survival. Periodic
   years with elevated nest survival may offset low annual productivity and
   contribute to the stability of American Oystercatcher populations.}},

Abstract = {{Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) staging at the Great Salt Lake,
   Utah, USA, sometimes experience weather-induced downings where many
   individuals are killed. Downings of Eared Grebes moving south during the
   fall have been reported for decades; however, spring downings are rare
   and underrepresented in the literature. On 15 April 2013, 13,500 Eared
   Grebes flying northward encountered inclement weather, were attracted to
   lights on Dugway Proving Ground, and downed. This spring downing was
   documented, and population characteristics were compared with those
   observed in previous downings. An estimated 38\% were killed outright.
   Rescue efforts promoted the survival of 88\% of those not killed on
   impact. Grebes that were 9-10 months old were, on average, 10\% lighter
   than adults in the same flight, perhaps indicating slow growth or age
   differences in foraging efficiency. Adults dominated all downings,
   supporting previous information that adults and young migrate on
   different schedules. The sex ratio in the North American population
   appears to be 1:1. Downings occur when Eared Grebes encounter inclement
   weather and are attracted to lights. Knowledge of the route, migration
   period, and flight speed of Eared Grebes allows predictions about when
   and where downings are likely to occur. Reducing the number and
   intensity of lights on snowy nights in high risk areas may decrease
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding parameters of the Black-faced Ibis (Theristicus melanopis)
   in pastures of southern Chile between 5 July and 30 November 2014 were
   evaluated. Thirty active nests were monitored in an area of 31 km(2),
   using a mirror mounted on a 13-m retractable aluminum pole. Each nest
   was visited once a week. The Black-faced Ibis presented an asynchronous
   posture period, with a maximum of three egg clutches. The first eggs
   were laid on 6 August 2014, and the mean incubation period was 28.66
   (+/- 4.41) days. Mean clutch size during the first posture was 2.23 (+/-
   0.73) with a range of one to three eggs per nest. None of the structural
   parameters of the nesting site evaluated were related to clutch size.
   The nests were oriented with a mean angle of 218 SW. Hatching of the
   chicks began on 25 September 2014, and the mean period of parental care
   lasted 36.67 (+/- 14.49) days. The apparent hatching success was 0.54,
   the fledging success was 0.40, and the total breeding cycle success was
   0.23 independent young per nest. Predation explained the 56.7\% nest
   loss. Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) was the main predator of eggs
   and chicks. The Mayfield estimator indicated a daily survival
   probability of 4.4\% for the incubation cycle, 26.2\% for the fledglings
   and 11.3\% for the total breeding cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake in summer and provides
   important habitat for an internationally significant assemblage of
   waterbirds in winter. Human-caused alterations to this system threaten
   to compromise the long-term viability of these bird populations due to
   the role of water in driving habitat suitability. Little is known,
   however, about the patch-scale habitat selection strategies of
   waterbirds within Poyang. Consequently, there is potential for spatial
   incongruence between protected area boundaries and key habitats given
   the system's high variability. This study used scan and focal sampling
   techniques to investigate patch selection by a wintering population of
   the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) within the Sha Hu sub-lake
   basin of Poyang Lake. Eurasian Spoonbills averaged higher foraging
   success rates in areas with water depth of 28.1-36.6 cm compared to
   other areas and preferred to forage in this depth class, as indicated by
   usage disproportionate to availability (Manly's standardized selection
   index = 0.817). Defining the patch-scale habitat selection of this
   indicator species both quantifies the impact of hydrological changes on
   resource availability and spatially predicts suitable areas for
   wintering birdlife within a dynamic environment.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology of stork colonies in southern Asia are very poorly
   understood. Factors affecting provisioning times of adults were
   evaluated at nests of two stork species, the Asian Openbill (Anastomus
   oscitans) and the Lesser Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), in lowland
   Nepal, where the landscape is dominated by multi-cropped agriculture
   fields. Analyses focused on understanding if provisioning times were
   influenced more due to colony-level variables, wetlands around colonies,
   or season. Using generalized additive mixed models and the
   information-theoretic approach, colony-level variables (brood size and
   chick age) showed non-trivial associations with provisioning times
   (substantially better than the null model). Univariate models with
   colony size and wetlands had poor support (worse than the null model).
   Season, which represented the changing cropping patterns, rainfall, and
   wetness on the landscape, was the most important variable for both
   species. The combination of season and wetlands was very important for
   provisioning Asian Openbills whose chicks fledged during the monsoon
   (July-October), but not for Lesser Adjutants whose chicks fledged in the
   drier winter months (November-February). Results strongly suggest that
   changing cropping patterns to a drier monsoonal crop, or reductions in
   wetland extents, will be detrimental to storks in Nepal.}},

Title = {{Habitat Selection by Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) at Multiple

Abstract = {{The highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Estuary, California, USA, is
   currently undergoing large-scale habitat restoration, and several
   thousand hectares of former salt evaporation ponds are being converted
   to tidal marsh. To identify potential effects of this habitat
   restoration on breeding waterbirds, habitat selection of radio tagged
   Forster's Terns (Sterna forster) was examined at multiple spatial scales
   during the pre-breeding and breeding seasons of 2005 and 2006. At each
   spatial scale, habitat selection ratios were calculated by season, year,
   and sex. Forster's Terns selected salt pond habitats at most spatial
   scales and demonstrated the importance of salt ponds for foraging and
   roosting. Salinity influenced the types of salt pond habitats that were
   selected. Specifically, Forster's Terns strongly selected lower salinity
   salt ponds (0.5-30 g/L) and generally avoided higher salinity salt ponds
   31 g/L). Forster's Terns typically used tidal marsh and managed marsh
   habitats in proportion to their availability, avoided upland and tidal
   flat habitats, and strongly avoided open bay habitats. Salt ponds
   provide important habitat for breeding waterbirds, and restoration
   efforts to convert former salt ponds to tidal marsh may reduce the
   availability of preferred breeding and foraging areas.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of aquatic birds on nutrient cycling and energy flow was
   investigated in two soda pans, one turbid and the other colored, with
   different physical and chemical characteristics. Primary plankton
   production and respiration were measured together with an estimation of
   waterbird carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus loading during 2014. Both pans
   were hypertrophic and showed net heterotrophy. The nutrient loading of
   the birds in the turbid pan was approximately five times higher (C: 758
   kg/ha/year, N: 122 kg/ha/year, P: 20 kg/ha/year) than in the colored
   pan, with significant guanotrophication. Despite the high chlorophyll a
   concentrations (turbid: 752 mu g/i and colored: 369 mu g/I, on average),
   the annual surface-related planktonic production was relatively low
   (turbid: 64 mg C/m(2)/year and colored: 23 mg C/m(2)/year), by contrast,
   respiration was similar in the two pans (turbid: 75 C/m(2)/year and
   colored: 78 mg C/m(2)/year). Nutrient loading showed a significant
   positive correlation with total and soluble reactive phosphorus,
   chlorophyll a and gross planktonic production, supporting the conclusion
   that the waterbirds significantly affected primary production. By
   contrast, there was no significant correlation between the nutrient
   loading and planktonic respiration. The low production and respiration
   ratio (Pro/Res) in the colored pan was presumably caused by a high
   dissolved organic carbon concentration (polyhumic). A possible
   explanation for the difference of Pro/Res between the turbid and colored
   pans is variation in the decomposition of the bird excrement and
   surrounding macrophytes.}},

Abstract = {{The biology of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) has been studied on
   several continents, but information from central Asia is limited. Colony
   characteristics and nest site selection of Common Terns were studied in
   the desert and steppe of Mongolia to determine factors that influence
   their choices. Common Terns nested in marshy areas around small ponds,
   on sand bars adjacent to a lake in the Gobi, and on small islands in a
   water treatment plant in the steppe of Ulaanbaatar. In the Gobi, they
   nested with Pied Avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta) that defended the
   colony site, while the terns left. Common Terns selected colony sites
   surrounded by water and muck/mud, and nest sites with good visibility.
   Their choice of colony and nest sites seemed to be a compromise between
   avoiding flooding, avoiding nest trampling-by livestock, and finding any
   safe nesting place to avoid terrestrial predators.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of louse infestation in waterbirds deserve attention due to
   potential impacts on host populations. Red-necked Grebes (Podiceps
   grisegena) were visually examined for the presence of amblyceran chewing
   lice during the 2000-2015 breeding seasons in eastern Poland. Only one
   species of lice (Pseudomenopon dolium) was recorded. Amblyceran
   prevalence was low; four young birds (2.7\%) were found infested out of
   147 banded individuals (66 adults and 81 chicks). However, all infested
   Red-necked Grebes bore heavy parasite loads. Negative consequences of
   infestation for physiological condition were indicated by low hemoglobin
   and total protein values when compared with same-age non-infested birds.
   The low infestation rate can be related to the biology of the host (a
   diving species undergoing molt at sea, solitary breeder) and the
   apparent high pathogenicity of P. dolium, which left numerous holes in
   feathers and bleeding bites in all parasitized birds.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from the
   endangered Barau's Petrel (Pterodroma baraui), endemic to Reunion
   Island, Indian Ocean, France, facilitating population studies for
   conservation. In 148 samples from two colonies, the total number of
   alleles per loci ranged from three to eight, observed heterozygosity
   ranged between 0.11 and 0.86, and null allele frequency ranged between
   0.000 and 0.093. An observed similarity in annealing temperatures across
   loci and the wide range of fragment sizes facilitated polymerase chain
   reaction multiplexing and rapid multilocus genotyping. These results
   will enable further investigation into the genetic diversity, effective
   population size, and small-scale geographical relationships among
   populations of this endangered species, encouraging additional
   conservation initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Avian research that involves potential disturbance to the study species
   may have unintended fitness consequences and could lead to biases in
   measurements of interest. The effects of band resighting on the behavior
   of mixed-species flocks of staging waterbirds were evaluated against
   recreational pedestrian activity that was expected to cause flushing. We
   found a model with additive effects of distance (near, 0-50 m, or far,
   50-200 m) and disturbance type (researcher or pedestrian) best explained
   flock behaviors. The proportion of staging flocks that flushed in
   response to pedestrians was greatest when pedestrians were within 50 m
   of the flock. Virtually no flushes were observed in response to
   researchers, regardless of distance. These results could assist in
   alleviating concerns that accepted protocols used for intensive band
   resighting studies on staging seabirds of special conservation status,
   such as Roseate (Sterna dougallii) and Common (S. hirundo) terns, may
   have adverse effects. Our framework could be used by others to test the
   effects of similar research on sensitive species. Received 24 April,
   2016, accepted 11 June 2016.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand how wading birds select among microhabitats that
   show spatial heterogeneity, a concrete weir located at the terminus of
   the Little Arkansas River in Wichita, Kansas, USA, was divided into
   patches based on water depth. Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax
   nycticorax; n = 396), Great Egrets (Ardea alba; n = 54), Snowy Egrets
   (Egretta thula; n = 36), and Great Blue Herons (Adrea herodias; n = 30)
   were observed for 60 hr from 10 June-29 July 2015. The total number of
   individuals was recorded, as was species specific patch use, feeding
   activity, and aggression. Only time of day and water depth predicted the
   number of birds at the weir (R-2 = 0.52). Wading bird species differed
   in capture efficiency, mean prey size, and patch use. Great Blue Herons
   and Black-crowned Night-Herons mainly captured larger fish below the
   weir, Snowy Egrets captured mostly smaller fish along the weir edges,
   and Great Egrets captured both large and small fish. Mean fish length
   differed by patch and ranged from 2.8-11.9 cm. Total aggression
   correlated with the number of large fish caught but not with total fish;
   per capita aggression correlated with the number of birds.
   Electrofishing showed a non-uniform spatial distribution of fish numbers
   and biomass. Species-specific foraging patterns reflected patterns of
   water depth, fish distribution, and aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Belief that most seabirds return to breed where they had been reared as
   chicks and exhibit high levels of philopatry and, by implication, have
   low levels of gene flow, is untenable. In the past, estimates of
   philopatry have been exaggerated because of the comparative ease of
   finding individuals returning to their natal area and the difficulty in
   locating those that have moved away. Measures of philopatry in seabirds
   obtained from unbiased data show wide between-species variation, and
   overall it is much lower than was formerly believed. While philopatry is
   obviously low in species that nest in and move between temporary
   habitats, it can also be low in colonial species that use the same
   nesting sites for many years (e.g., cliff-nesting species). Comparisons
   of the extent of philopatry in other waterbird species show similar
   variation to those found in seabirds. The expression of philopatry is
   probably variable within a species and is influenced by environmental
   conditions and population pressures and so should not be considered a
   constant for individual species.}},

Abstract = {{The King Rail (Rallus elegans) is a secretive marsh bird of conservation
   concern. Reproductive success is thought to be a limiting factor for the
   inland migratory population. Reproductive effort of King Rails was
   studied in southeastern Oklahoma, USA, from 2010-2012 using surveys,
   radio-telemetry, nest searching and brood observations. During
   2011-2012, 27-29 King Rail territories were documented. Ten nests were
   located between the first week in April and the first week in July with
   a mean clutch size of 10.3 (SE = 0.80). Water depth at nests was shallow
   (< 15 cm), and nest sites were in locations with more visual
   obstruction, more microtopographic variation, and more woody stems,
   while open water cover was less than at random sites. Nine broods were
   followed and were found to use rearing sites that were in deeper water
   and had a greater percent of tall emergent vegetation and more woody
   vegetation than random sites. Brood size dropped from an average of nine
   to two chicks by the second week. Weekly brood survival rate was 0.87
   (SE = 0.045), which resulted in a 29\% probability of greater than one
   chick surviving to fledge at 9 weeks. Increasing reproductive success is
   a management concern for this inland migratory population of King Rails.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland connectivity provides migratory shorebirds varying options to
   meet energy requirements to survive and complete their annual cycle.
   Multiple factors mediate movement and residency of spatially segregated
   wetlands. Information on these factors is lacking in the tropics, yet
   such information is invaluable for conservation design. The influence of
   seven biotic and abiotic factors on local movement and residency rates
   of Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) among three major wetlands
   in southwestern Puerto Rico in 2013-2014 was assessed using multi-state
   models. The model with highest support (AIC(c) w(i), = 0.78) indicated
   that weekly residency rates increased seasonally, and were positively
   influenced by bird abundance and the interaction of prey density and
   rainfall. Movement rates were negatively influenced by inter-wetland
   distance, which varied annually, ranging from 0.01 +/- 0.004 to 0.33 +/-
   0.08. Age class (adult, juvenile), extent of shoreline habitat (km), and
   body condition (estimated percent fat) did not influence residency rates
   (95\% CIs overlapped Betas). Our findings indicated that coastal
   wetlands in southwestern Puerto Rico were connected, pointing at the
   joint value of salt flats and mangroves for overwintering Semipalmated
   Sandpipers. Connectivity between different types of wetlands likely
   widens resource diversity, which is essential for coping with
   unpredictable environments. Additional work is needed to generalize our
   understanding of inter-wetland dynamics and their potential benefits to
   inform shorebird conservation strategies in the Caribbean.}},

Abstract = {{In numerous avian species, egg size is correlated to female body
   condition, hatchling size and nestling growth. Recent demography studies
   of Interior Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) suggest a
   migratory divide across the Great Lakes; western populations winter in
   the Gulf of Mexico region of the southeastern United States (Alabama,
   Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) with extensive catfish (Ictalurus
   punctatus) aqua culture, and eastern populations winter in Florida,
   where catfish aquaculture is not pervasive. If Double-crested Cormorants
   have improved their overall body condition through catfish exploitation,
   then egg and chick sizes should also be affected. Three breeding areas
   in Ontario (east, central, and west) were selected for empirical
   measures of size variation. During the breeding seasons of 2006 and
   2007, egg, naked young, fledgling, and adult morphometric data were
   collected. Eggs in eastern areas (volume = 465.8 +/- 3.9 cm(3)) were on
   average larger than eggs in central (volume = 458.1 +/- 3.5 cm(3)) and
   western (volume = 451.7 +/- 3.5 cm(3)) areas. However, chicks in eastern
   areas (culmen = 54.9 +/- 0.6 mm) were smaller than chicks in central
   (culmen = 57.6 +/- 0.4 mm) and western (culmen = 59.3 +/- 0.3 mm) areas,
   not only at hatching, but throughout development and fledging. A
   comprehensive Double -crested Cormorant morphometric gradient that may
   suggest a potential reproductive advantage for birds exploiting
   aquaculture facilities is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding King Rails (Rallus elegans) have become more reliant on coastal
   marshes, but these are prone to variation in water level influenced by
   estuarine effluent and storm surge. Nest-building behavior in King Rails
   was studied in a natural coastal marsh subjected to a wind-driven tide
   system, where rapid water level rise from storm surge has led to nest
   inundation. To determine whether breeders exhibited plasticity in nest
   building in response to water level variation, nest height and water
   level were monitored at 2- to 3-day intervals, and video was used to
   quantify building behavior. Average height varied substantially among
   King Rail nests, indicating plasticity in overall building effort. King
   Rails constructed significantly taller nests at sites with greater
   variation in water level. Parents spent a greater proportion of time
   nest building when the water level was closer to the nest rim. The
   majority of nest accumulation occurred before laying ceased. Though King
   Rails continue to build through the nesting cycle, which is likely to
   counteract settling and improve the structural integrity of nests, they
   may not be able to increase nest height quickly enough to avoid flooding
   when faced with rapidly rising water.}},

   a mark-resighting model using 15 years of neck-collar data (2001-2015)
   provided age -dependent survival rates and season -dependent encounter
   rates with a constant neck-collar retention rate. Annual survival rate
   was 0.638 (95\% CI: 0.378-0.803) for adults and 0.122 (95\% CI:
   0.028-0.286) for first-year juveniles. Known-fate models were applied to
   the single season of telemetry data (autumn 2014) and estimated a mean
   annual survival rate of 0.408 (95\% CI: 0.152-0.670) with higher but
   non-significant differences for adults (0.477) vs. juveniles (0.306).
   Our findings indicate that Swan Goose survival rates are comparable to
   the lowest rates reported for European or North American goose species.
   Poor survival may be a key demographic parameter contributing to their
   declining trend. Quantitative threat assessments and associated
   conservation measures, such as restricting hunting, may be a key step to
   mitigate for their low survival rates and maintain or enhance their
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite telemetry was used to investigate summer and winter home
   ranges for resident and migrant American White Pelicans (Pelecanus
   erythrorhynchos) captured in the southeastern United States between 2002
   and 2007. Home range utilization distributions were calculated using
   50\% and 95\% kernel density estimators with the plug-in bandwidth
   selector. Mean summer home ranges (95\%) varied from 177 to 4,710 km(2)
   and mean winter home ranges (95\%) ranged from 185 to 916 km2. Mean 50\%
   and 95\% home ranges of adult American White Pelicans during summer
   tended to be larger than those during winter, whereas mean 50\% and 95\%
   home ranges of immature pelicans during summer tended to be smaller than
   those during winter. Home ranges for all American White Pelicans
   encompassed the latitude range of 24 degrees-55 degrees N, including
   wintering, stop over, and nesting habitat. These data provide baseline
   movement and home range data for future studies of American White
   Pelican ecology.}},

   colonies were 1.3 +/- 0.5 m apart (Range = 0.6-4.5; n = 327), whereas
   colonies were 329 m apart (Range = 21-1,136; n = 63). Within colonies,
   80\% of nests were initiated within 10 days of each other. Colonies
   contained 41.0 +/- 37.6 nests (Range = 1-148; n = 63). Most colonies
   were initiated during the austral winter and spring (June-September) in
   contrast to opportunistic breeding in inland areas. Clutch size averaged
   1.92 +/- 0.36 eggs (Range = 1-4; n = 2,297), and incubation lasted 32
   days (Range = 28-38; n = 57). Hatching success averaged 41.5 +/- 38.6\%
   (Range = 0-99; n = 24 colonies), the number of nestlings that survived
   to join a creche was 20.3 +/- 22.4\% (Range = 0-66; n = 24 colonies),
   and fledging success averaged 15.3 +/- 18.3\% (Range = 0-61; n = 24
   colonies). Aggression among nestlings and resulting wounds were observed
   in 48\% of broods (n = 64). Mortality during the 10-day nestling period
   was high (5.5 +/- .2\%/day; Range = 2.5-10.0; n = 45) and was the major
   determinant of overall breeding success. These findings suggest that
   Australian Pelicans exhibit siblicidal brood reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying parasitized nests and eggs is a prerequisite for studying
   conspecific brood parasitism. Previous studies on the effectiveness of
   egg morphology to identify parasitic eggs of different species have
   produced mixed results. Brood parasitism and egg measurements (length,
   width and weight) were monitored in Common Coot (Fulica atra; n = 85)
   nests. Maximum Euclidean distance was calculated for each nest. Results
   indicated that maximum Euclidean distance values of non -parasitized and
   parasitized nests were significantly different (t(83) = 9.747, P <
   0.01). The optimal split value of recursive partitioning analysis for
   Common Coot nests was 2.98 (R-2 = 0.65), which can identify 93.3\%
   non-parasitized and 88.0\% parasitized nests successfully. However the
   most dissimilar egg in parasitized nests calculated by maximum average
   Euclidean distance only identified 39.3\% of the parasitic eggs
   correctly. Egg morphology is effective for detecting conspecific brood
   parasitism of Common Coot nests, but is not accurate enough to determine
   parasitic eggs. As a result, this method should be used with caution and
   combined with observational or molecular biology methods.}},

Abstract = {{Collisions with power lines are a widely documented cause of avian
   mortality. Estimating total mortalities from counts of carcasses is
   usually accomplished by quantifying biasing factors, but neither
   crippling nor nocturnal biases are well understood. From 4 March through
   13 April 2009, data were collected on Sandhill Crane (Gras canadensis)
   collisions involving a 69-kV transmission line crossing the Platte River
   in Nebraska, USA, at a major migration stopover area. The line was
   marked with devices designed to increase visibility to Sandhill Cranes,
   and thus reduce collisions. Numbers of carcasses detected via
   traditional searches that involved walking slowly in a zigzag pattern
   beneath the line were compared to numbers of collisions visually
   observed through binoculars and night vision spotting scopes and numbers
   of collisions detected by electronic Bird Strike Indicators (BSI).
   Seventeen carcasses were found during traditional surveys, 117
   collisions were observed visually, and 321 collisions were recorded by
   BSIs. Most collisions occurred at night, with crippled Sandhill Cranes
   departing survey transects. Total mortality, including crippling and
   nocturnal biases, was 2.8 to 3.7 times greater than indicated by a
   traditional corrected-count mortality estimator. Neither crippling bias
   nor nocturnal bias were adequately considered by the traditional
   estimator. Consistent with other studies of avian collision, line
   marking was only partially successful in reducing collisions.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the Little Tern (Sternula albifrons), an estuarine seabird
   species breeding in southern Portugal, was determined by separately
   identifying fish otoliths and scales found in pellets. Using both fish
   otoliths and scales showed that the diet of Little Terns was mainly
   composed of sand-smelts (Atherina spp.), but there were differences in
   secondary prey items. Species such as sardine (Sardina pikhardus), with
   very small and easily degraded otoliths, showed a higher percentage of
   occurrence in the diet using scale analysis. This study suggests that
   both methods should be used together to evaluate the diet of small

Abstract = {{The Tofino Wah-nah-jus Hilth-hoo-is Mudflats on Vancouver Island,
   British Columbia, Canada, include both pristine areas and sites with
   residential and resort development. Shorebird counts were conducted at
   six sites around these mudflats in 2011 and compared with historical
   counts from 1988, 1989, and 1995. Temporal trends of counts did not vary
   among sites with different levels of disturbance. Over the entire
   mudflats, counts of Dunlin (Calidris alpina) moving northward had a
   negative trend over time (beta(yr) = -0.04), as did counts of Western
   Sandpiper (Calidris mauri; (beta(yr) = -0.04), Least Sandpiper (Calidris
   minutilla; beta(yr) = -0.03) and Short-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus
   griseus; beta(yr)= -0.04) moving southward. In contrast, counts of
   Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola; ( beta(yr) = 0.03) and
   Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus, (beta(yr) = 0.02) moving
   northward increased over time. Counts of Dunlin and Short-billed
   Dowitcher were lower at disturbed sites relative to non-disturbed sites,
   indicating that disturbance may be displacing birds away from some
   sites. Further, counts of northward migrating shorebirds were negatively
   correlated with the presence of people and dogs at the most disturbed
   site (Chesterman Beach). Monitoring and precautionary actions to address
   effects of disturbance at this important stopover site are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae) depend on their hind limbs (legs) to
   pursue prey underwater, rendering these structures critical for their
   survival. Assemblages of three or more species can be found in a variety
   of regions including the coasts of western USA (California), central
   Chile, and western South Africa. Cormorants all hunt via pursuit diving
   underwater while remaining close to shore, yet are able to coexist; an
   occurrence that is not well understood. Variation in feeding ecology
   within cormorant assemblages was expected to be reflected in the legs.
   Leg structure was examined by measurement of five leg bone
   characteristics from skeletal specimens of 10 species from assemblages
   within the aforementioned regions. Principle component analysis
   identified the femur and tarsometatarsus as having the highest degrees
   of variation. The femur was found to have the shortest length, relative
   to total leg length, in putative shoaling fish specialists. The
   tarsometatarsus was found to have the shortest length, relative to total
   leg length, in putative benthic fish specialists. Mantel's Test revealed
   that leg structures of members of the same putative feeding type were
   distributed closer together in Euclidean space (mean distance: 2.84)
   than leg structures of members of distinct putative feeding types
   (3.27); however, this was not significant (r = 0.138, t = 0.086, P =
   0.233) indicating that similarity among assemblages is not statistically
   well-supported. Findings support niche differentiation within the
   studied regions.}},

Abstract = {{Daily survival rate of Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) nests from
   four different nesting colonies in northern India (Delhi Zoo, Keoladeo
   National Park, Chhata and Khanpur) were modeled as a function of
   multiple covariates. These included nest and colony specific parameters,
   year, daily maximum and minimum temperatures and sizes of foraging
   wetlands in the vicinity. A total of 1,095 Painted Stork nests (606 from
   2013-2014 and 489 nests from 2014-2015) were monitored at an interval of
   4-7 days during a study spanning two breeding seasons. Considerable
   variations were observed in annual nest survival due to the amount of
   rainfall and hence availability of suitable wetlands for foraging in the
   vicinity of the colony. Nest survival was strongly dependent upon nest
   age in that nests built early in the season had a higher survival
   probability (beta(Nest density) = 1.13, SE = 0.16). Daily survival rate
   was higher for nests located in high nest density colonies (beta(Nest
   density) = 0.64, SE = 0.04). The additive effect of daily minimum
   temperature on the nest survival rate was positive (beta(Nest) (min) =
   1.21, SE = 0.26) indicating that lower temperatures in winter negatively
   influenced daily survival rate. Nest survival in Painted Stork is
   significantly affected by environmental factors like rainfall and daily
   minimum temperature, besides colony specific parameters such as nest
   density.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers, densities, and sex ratios of Yellow Rails (Coturnicops
   noveboracensis) wintering at Red Slough Wildlife Management Area in
   McCurtain County, Oklahoma, USA, were approximated and compared to
   estimates from birds wintering in coastal Texas, USA. Deuterium (delta
   D) and sulfur (delta S-34) values from rectrices of birds wintering in
   Oklahoma and in Texas were also examined to determine where the birds
   bred. Yellow Rails in Oklahoma from October 2009 through April 2010 were
   banded. Fifty-six Yellow Rails were captured, and the population was
   estimated to consist of 90.3 +/- 25.5 birds, or 5.3 +/- 1.5 rails {*}
   ha(-1), which is similar to the published density of Yellow Rails in
   coastal Texas. Sex ratios did not differ from an expected 1:1
   male:female ratio and did not differ between Oklahoma and Texas.
   Rectrices from Texas (n= 40) and Oklahoma (n = 32) had similar delta D
   values and were broadly consistent with published delta D values from
   southeastern Alberta to James Bay in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The
   delta S-34 analysis from Texas (n = 4) and Oklahoma (n = 35) showed only
   two birds, both from Texas, with enriched delta S-34 values, suggesting
   that most birds from Texas and Oklahoma bred in interior Canadian
   marshes. Although the sample size was small, these results suggest
   interior overwintering sites contain similar densities to coastal sites.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss due to human development is a threat to colonial waterbird
   species, which require nesting habitat in proximity to productive
   aquatic foraging areas to ensure reproductive success. When development
   of habitat occurs, waterbirds must either tolerate the changes or
   relocate nesting colonies to habitat elsewhere. Land cover and nesting
   colony data were used to study the implications of development for the
   Pacific Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodiasfanning). Colonies were closer
   to major foraging areas than expected by chance, but were not farther
   from human development than expected by chance, suggesting that Pacific
   Great Blue Herons will tolerate some development to remain close to
   major foraging areas. There was no relationship between distance to
   human development and colony productivity; however, distance to major
   foraging area was a significant predictor of productivity, which
   suggests Pacific Great Blue Herons may prioritize proximity to foraging
   areas because it is critical for reproductive success. Given their
   demonstrated preference for proximity to foraging areas, and high levels
   of development near these areas, relocation away from human development
   may not be an option for nesting Pacific Great Blue Herons in south
   coastal British Columbia, Canada, because potential nesting habitat
   availability was most restricted within 5 km of major foraging areas.
   Future management strategies for this species, and colonial waterbirds
   in general, should prioritize conservation of nesting habitat near major
   foraging areas to maximize future reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this study was to gain knowledge on post-release
   survival and movement of Western Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis)
   using a modified technique for implanting satellite transmitters. This
   technique had improved post-surgical survival in an earlier study. Nine
   Western Grebes, implanted with intracoelomic (within the body cavity)
   satellite transmitters with percutaneous antennae, were released close
   to their capture site in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Eight
   survived at least 25 days (average number of transmittal days was
   140.8), while two had transmitters that provided data for greater than 1
   year (436 and 454 days). The average cumulative distance recorded for
   all Western Grebes (n = 9) was 829 km with two round-trip movements
   documented. One individual Western Grebe traveled a cumulative
   round-trip distance of 2,144 km in July and November 2011, while another
   individual traveled a round-trip distance of 1,514 km between 8 and 14
   December 2011. This study provides a step forward in testing implantable
   satellite transmitters in Western Grebes and highlights the need to
   further improve tracking methods, potentially improving our
   understanding of their population threats.}},

Abstract = {{The biology and behavior of Agami Herons (Agamia agami) are not well
   known. This paper describes the species' foraging, nesting, plumage,
   soft-part coloration, courtship, and disturbance response studied during
   a 28-hour 8-day study period, 11-18 May 2015, in Costa Rica. Agami
   Herons forage by standing on perches and walking or wading slowly,
   capturing small prey using a slow neck extension followed by a grasp.
   Courtship emphasizes its spectacular, short-lived silver crest and other
   similarly distinctive plumage and soft-part features. Thirteen courtship
   behaviors described are used by both sexes. The female, rather than the
   male, retains intense red lores during pair formation. Only two nest
   change-overs and no chick feeding were observed, which, along with
   evidence of distant foraging, suggest a nesting strategy accommodating
   long intervals between chick provisioning. Agami Herons respond to
   disturbance with a rattling call and by walking away into vegetative
   cover. This observed sensitivity to disturbance reinforces a
   conservation strategy for the species emphasizing protection of
   regionally important nesting colonies and their foraging habitat.}},

Title = {{A Low-disturbance Capture Technique for Ground-nesting Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus)}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{193-198}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Capturing breeding adults of colonially nesting species can entail risks
   of nest failure and even colony abandonment, especially in species that
   react strongly to human disturbance. A low-disturbance technique for
   capturing specific adult Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) at a ground-nesting colony was developed to reduce these risks
   and is described here. Nesting habitat enhancement was used to attract
   Double crested Cormorants to nest adjacent to above-ground tunnels
   constructed so that researchers could capture birds by hand. Using this
   technique, Double-crested Cormorants (n = 87) were captured during the
   incubation and chick-rearing stages of the nesting cycle. Unlike
   alternative capture techniques, this approach allowed targeting of
   specific individuals for capture and recapture, minimized local
   disturbance, and eliminated colony-wide disturbances. The tunnel-based
   system presented here could be adapted to capture adults or to access
   the nest contents of other ground-nesting colonial species that are
   inclined to nest in areas of enhanced nesting habitat and adapt to
   anthropogenic structures in their nesting area. This system would be
   particularly beneficial for other wary and easily disturbed species.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale environmental characteristics associated with nesting
   burrows of the Newell's Shearwater (Puffinus newelh) and Hawaiian Petrel
   (Pterodronta sandwichensis) were documented in mesic and wet montane
   forest on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, USA. Most plots containing
   burrows were located on steep slopes, ranging from 28 degrees to 48
   degrees (median = 39 degrees) for the Newell's Shearwater and 0 to 67
   degrees (median = 34.5 degrees) for the Hawaiian Petrel. Plots generally
   contained > 20\% to 40\% up to > 80\% to 100\% estimated vegetation
   cover 0-1 m above ground and > 0\% to 20\% up to > 60\% to 80\% cover
   1-2 m above ground. Plots were also associated with estimated canopy
   cover from > 0\% to 10\% up to > 80\% to 90\% for the Newell's
   Shearwater and 0\% up to > 70\% to 80\% for the Hawaiian Petrel. Soil in
   Newell's Shearwater plots tended to be harder 7.62-22.86 cm below
   ground, which might provide increased burrow stability. Additionally,
   maximum vegetation height tended to be greater above Newell's Shearwater
   plots (median = 6.00 m) than Hawaiian Petrel plots (median = 3.25 m).
   Taller trees may serve as climbing structures helping Newell's
   Shearwaters become airborne in thickly vegetated regions that are
   farther from ridgelines and associated with lighter wind speeds aloft.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific and intersexual morphological variation is common in many
   groups of birds, but few studies with larger sample sizes exist for
   describing such variation in ardeids. Since 2008, three species of
   long-legged wading birds were captured for telemetry studies in Wichita,
   Kansas, USA, and on the East Coast of the USA in North Carolina,
   Maryland, and New Jersey. Captured individuals were weighed and their
   culmens and tarsi were measured before they were released. Beginning in
   2013, a blood sample was collected from each bird and was used to
   determine its sex. Measurements of 103 birds of three species were used
   to examine statistical relationships among mass, culmen length, and
   tarsus length, and to determine whether males of Great Egrets (Ardea
   alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) differed from females in these
   values. Great Blue Herons (A. herodias; 1,702-2,859 g), Great Egrets
   (769-1,300 g), and Snowy Egrets (349-539 g) all showed high variation in
   body weights, but significantly lower variation in culmen and tarsus
   lengths. For all three species, body weight correlated significantly
   with both culmen and tarsus lengths, which were themselves strongly
   associated. Male Great and Snowy egrets were significantly heavier than
   females and also had longer culmens and tarsi. The role of interspecific
   differences in body size in reducing competition at feeding sites is
   discussed, as is the possible role of intersexual differences during the
   breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{North American migratory shorebirds have declined markedly since the
   1980s, underscoring the importance of population surveys to conduct
   status and trend assessments. Shorebird surveys were conducted during
   three multi-year periods between 1985 and 2014 and used to assess
   changes in numbers and species composition at the Cabo Rojo Salt Flats,
   Puerto Rico, USA, a site of regional importance in the eastern
   Caribbean. Eight fewer species (total = 21) were recorded in 2013-2014
   as compared to the 29 from 1985-1992; all eight species were Nearctic
   migrants. Small calidrids had the highest population counts; however,
   this suite of species and all others experienced a >= 70\% decline.
   Combined counts from the salt flats and neighboring wetlands in
   2013-2014 were lower than counts only from the Cabo Rojo Salt Flats in
   two previous multi-year survey periods, which indicated a real change in
   numbers not just a shift in wetland use. Invertebrate prey density was
   lower in 2013-2014 than in 1994. Body fat condition of Semipalmated
   Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), an index of habitat quality, did not
   differ between 1985-1992 and 2013-2014. These findings do not exclude
   the possibility that other species might be affected by lower prey
   density, or that local declines in numbers reflect changes at
   hemispheric, not local, scales. The magnitude of change between local
   and hemispheric scales closely matched for some species. Continued
   monitoring at the salt flats is warranted to help gauge the status of
   shorebirds in Puerto Rico and discern the probable cause of declines.
   Monitoring other sites in the Caribbean is needed for stronger
   inferences about regional status and trends.}},

Abstract = {{The Lesser Crested Tern (Thalasseus bengalensis) is a ground-nesting
   seabird that breeds only on subtropical and tropical islands from
   northern Africa to northern Australia. Despite their wide distribution,
   few studies have been conducted on the breeding ecology of this species.
   On Jana Island, Saudi Arabia, which is northeast of the Saudi Arabia
   mainland, the midday ground temperature may reach 60 degrees C during
   the summer. In this study, two cameras were used to record the
   incubation behavior of Lesser Crested Terns to evaluate their coping
   ability in this extremely hot environment. The behavioral mechanism that
   the seabirds used to maintain optimal egg temperatures was also
   evaluated. The results show that Lesser Crested Terns attend their eggs
   continuously during a 24-hr period without leaving the nests, except
   when a disturbance occurs. This behavior prevents the eggs from reaching
   lethal temperatures. In addition, position of the sun influenced the
   incubation behavior. Most incubating Lesser Crested Terns faced west in
   the morning, and began rotating clockwise until they faced east in the
   evening. This behavior may play a vital role in preventing both eggs and
   incubating adults from overheating.}},

Abstract = {{After an increase from the 1930s through the mid-1990s, the populations
   of the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), the Lesser Black-backed Gull (L.
   fuscus fuscus), and the Great Black-backed Gull (L. marinus) in Finland
   are currently declining at rates of 0.5\%, 2.7\%, and 1.5\% per annum,
   respectively. Although now declining in numbers, the Herring Gull is
   still the dominant gull species on Finnish coasts. The nominate Lesser
   Black-backed Gull, formerly the most abundant large gull in the Baltic
   Sea, is now considered endangered over its entire range. The Great
   Black-backed Gull has largely followed the trajectories of the other two
   species, but in much lower numbers. The decline of the Lesser
   Black-backed Gull may have been caused by severe reproductive failures
   due to pollutants and predation, while the factors behind the declines
   of the other two species are largely unknown.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-28}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Between-population variation of changes in numbers can provide insights
   into factors influencing variation in demography and how population size
   or density is regulated. Here, spatio-temporal patterns of population
   change of Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), Lesser Black-backed Gull (L.
   fuscus) and Great Black-backed Gull (L. marinus) in the British Isles
   are described. The aim of this study was to test for density-dependence
   and spatial variation in population trends as two possible, but not
   mutually exclusive, explanations of population changes with important
   implications for the understanding of these changes. Between 1969 and
   2013, the three species showed different population trends with Herring
   Gulls showing a strong decline, Lesser Black-backed Gulls an increase
   until 2000 but then a decline since, and Great Black-backed Gulls
   showing no clear pattern. Population changes in Herring Gulls varied
   between different regions of the British Isles with decreases in the
   northern and western parts of the British Isles and no clear trends
   elsewhere. Population changes were density-dependent in the Herring
   Gull, and Lesser Black-backed Gulls showed faster population increases
   at lower Herring Gull densities. Herring Gulls seemed to seek refuge in
   urban environments, whereas Lesser Black-backed Gulls expanded their
   range into the urban environment. The large declines in hitherto
   abundant species create a dilemma for conservation bodies in
   prioritizing conservation policies. The spatial variation in population
   changes and the differences between species suggest that there is no
   single cause for the observed changes, thus requiring region and
   species-specific conservation management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Great Black-backed (Larus marinus), Lesser Black-backed (L. fuscus) and
   Herring (L. argentatus) gulls have all shown population increases and
   range expansion in Greenland in recent decades, but in very different
   ways. Great Black-backed Gulls increased from at least the 1960s from an
   established, local population. Lesser Black-backed Gulls immigrated from
   Iceland in the 1980s, spread rapidly over most of the southern part of
   Greenland and are common and abundant today. Herring Gulls also
   immigrated in the 1980s, but only established a small, scattered, and,
   at many sites, irregular breeding population. Here, we present the most
   recent information on the status and trends of Great Black-backed Gull,
   Lesser Black-backed Gull and Herring Gull populations in Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the status, trends and dynamics of large gulls nesting in
   northern areas is limited. Herring (Larus argentatus) and Great
   Black-backed (L. marinus) gull breeding colonies were surveyed in
   coastal Labrador, Canada, from 1998 to 2003 to assess short-term
   population trends and colony site dynamics. Between 1998 and 2003, 117
   islands distributed across three major archipelagos were surveyed on two
   or more occasions, documenting 1,054 gull clutches. Nesting was
   noticeably uniform across islands in the archipelagos, with mild
   aggregations noted in only one region. Incidence (the proportion of
   islands occupied by Herring and Great Black-backed gulls) declined over
   the study period, and there were fewer colonization events than
   abandonment events (also suggesting declines). Abundance declined in one
   region and overall at 2.9\% per year over the 6-year period. Colony
   abandonment rates did not detectably decline with increasing colony
   size, and island isolation, indexed by the number of islands within 5
   km, was not related to colonization rates. Herring and Great
   Black-backed gulls in Labrador showed positive incidence and abundance
   relationships at two spatial scales, indicating that more islands were
   occupied at larger local population sizes. This study revealed that
   colony-level metrics can be combined with population trend analysis to
   allow a richer assessment of the dynamics of colonial species.}},

Abstract = {{Sable Island is the most isolated seabird colony site in eastern Canada
   and the United States, offering a unique opportunity to study the
   population dynamics of terns and gulls in an area removed from human
   activities. Sable Island likely supported tens of thousands of terns
   prior to 1900, but the population declined during the first half of the
   20th century, coinciding with colonization by breeding gulls. An
   island-wide census of terns and gulls was conducted in 2012 and 2013,
   and those results were compared with surveys conducted over the previous
   45 years to assess changes in population abundance and distribution. The
   current island-wide population of Common (Sterna hirundo) and Arctic (S.
   paradisaea) terns was approximately 6,500 and 4,200 combined breeding
   pairs in 2012 and 2013, respectively, down from about 9,000 pairs
   estimated in 2008/2009, but higher than all estimates between 1970 and
   2006. Population growth of these tern species has been concentrated at
   two large colonies, each with over 2,000 breeding pairs, whereas the
   number of small colonies on the island has been in decline since 1998.
   Fewer than six pairs of Roseate Terns (S. dougallii) have nested on
   Sable Island since 1993, down from counts of more than 100 individuals
   in the 1970s. Estimates of breeding pairs ranged from 744 to 951 Herring
   Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 398 to 472 Great Black-backed Gulls (L.
   marinus) during 2012 and 2013. A survey of gulls documented 33 to 50\%
   fewer Herring Gulls and 23\% fewer Great Black-backed Gulls than in
   1970. Sable Island's tern and gull populations have fluctuated
   asynchronously over the past 100 years, and may be returning to a
   previous ecosystem state when gulls were absent and terns were abundant,
   but mechanisms underlying these trends are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The status and trends of Maine's island-nesting Herring Gull (Larus
   argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gull (L. marinus) populations have
   changed dramatically over the last century. Aerial photographs were used
   to count nesting Herring and Great Black-backed gulls at all colonies
   along the coast of Maine, USA, in 2008 and 2013. Population trends were
   assessed by comparing current survey data to a previous coastwide survey
   in 1977. The breeding population of Herring Gulls in Maine was estimated
   at 24,302 pairs nesting on 180 islands during 2008 and 21,488 pairs
   nesting on 180 islands during 2013. This represents an annual decline of
   2.3\% in the number of nests in Maine from 2008 to 2013. The breeding
   population of Great Black-backed Gulls in Maine was estimated at 10,094
   pairs nesting on 197 islands during 2008 and 6,934 pairs nesting on 191
   islands during 2013. This represents an annual decline of 6.3\% in the
   number of nests in Maine from 2008 to 2013. Nesting populations for both
   species appeared to peak in the 1990s. Between 1977 and 2013, the number
   of Herring Gull nests in Maine declined by 17\%, and the number of
   nesting islands declined by 19\%. Great Black-backed Gull populations
   also declined between 1977 and 2013, with a 30\% decline in the number
   of nests and a 14\% decline in the number of islands supporting nesting.
   The reason for the decline is unknown, but we speculate that these
   declines may be related to changing food availability around colonies
   and increased predation rates by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
   and mammals.}},

Abstract = {{A number of colonial waterbird species have been documented nesting on
   roof-tops throughout Europe and North America. The most common
   hypothesis explaining why gulls (Laridae) select roof-tops for nesting
   has been that population growth rates are higher than territory vacancy
   rates in traditional (island) habitat, suggesting that roof-tops are a
   non-preferred habitat. Roof-top habitat may actually be equal to or
   higher quality than island habitat as anthropogenic food is abundant and
   lower nest density may lead to lower intraspecific aggression and
   predation. During 2011-2012, reproductive effort and success was
   monitored in a regionally declining population of Herring Gulls (Larus
   argentatus) nesting on roof-tops in Portland, Maine, USA, and a nearby
   island-nesting colony on Appledore Island, Maine. Clutch size was lower
   in the roof-top colony, but egg volume did not differ between sites.
   Herring Gulls in the roof-top colony had lower hatching success but
   greater survival to day 30 for chicks that hatched than for those
   breeding in the island colony. The average number of chicks per nest to
   reach day 30 was 0.72 on the roof-tops and 0.84 on the island. This
   shows, therefore, that roof-top nesting may be an adaptive reproductive
   strategy even under scenarios with reduced competition for nesting
   territories on traditional nesting islands.}},

Abstract = {{During the 20th century, gull populations in North America experienced
   considerable changes in abundance and geographic ranges. The objective
   of this study was to describe population trends of Herring Gulls (Larus
   argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) in the New York
   Bight, USA, over a 40-year period (1974-2013). A variety of data sources
   using different survey methods provided estimates of the number of
   breeding pairs for both species. In the Long Island portion of the New
   York Bight, overall Herring and Great Black-backed gull nesting
   populations appear to have fluctuated considerably in size during this
   time period, and the largest numbers of breeding individuals of these
   two species occurred in the 1980s. In coastal New Jersey, the Herring
   Gull nesting population has remained relatively constant, whereas the
   Great Black-backed Gull nesting population has increased. Individual
   nesting colonies are dynamic and can vary in size considerably during
   even short time periods. Several factors, including sea-level changes
   and the availability of anthropogenic food sources (i.e., at landfills
   and fisheries by-catch), likely have strongly influenced individual
   colonies and the overall Herring and Great Black-backed gull breeding
   populations in the New York Bight.}},

Abstract = {{Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) were rare at the beginning of the
   20th century, possibly because of intensive exploitation. Once they
   became protected in 1916, their numbers increased throughout eastern
   North America, reaching a maximum of 875,000 breeding pairs around 1990.
   Since then, an overall decline of 19\% has been recorded in the Great
   Lakes and the St. Lawrence River while their numbers tripled in Atlantic
   Canada. The largest concentrations are still found on the Great Lakes
   with 38\% and 42\% of the birds breeding in Canada and the USA,
   respectively. The remaining individuals breed along the St. Lawrence
   River (15\%), on Lake Champlain (2\%), and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
   including the Atlantic Provinces and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon (3\%). In
   2009, a study was undertaken in the largest colony located on Ile
   Deslauriers near Montreal, Quebec, to determine the factors that
   regulate the number of breeding birds. This colony supported 52,000
   pairs in 2000 and 44,000 in 2012. Ring-billed Gulls had a lower
   reproductive output in 2010-2012 compared to the late 1970s attributed
   to reduced chick survival. The number of gull-days at the nearest
   landfill declined from 906,000 in 1995 to 40,000 in 2012 following the
   implementation of a falconry deterrence program. Limited access to an
   abundant food supply located near the colony may have reduced chick
   survival. How this affects annual survival and population size remains
   to be determined. In the long term, policies that aim to reduce input of
   organic matter at landfills and discourage citizens from feeding gulls
   could further contribute to the decline of Ring-billed Gulls in eastern
   North America.}},

Abstract = {{South Africa's population of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus vetula)
   numbered about 10,000 pairs during 1976/1977-1980/1981, increased to
   21,000 pairs from 2000/2001-2004/2005 and then decreased to 17,500 pairs
   from 2009/2010-2013/2014. The increase in the late 20th century and the
   decrease in the early 21st century were mainly attributable to large
   increases and decreases in numbers breeding at islands off the west
   coast of South Africa. The increases followed cessation of controls on
   Kelp Gulls at the islands in the 1970s and were associated with
   supplementary food provided by fisheries and landfill sites, whereas the
   decreases were influenced by substantial predation of chicks by Great
   White Pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus). The decreases of Kelp Gulls at
   islands off the west coast of South Africa in the early 21st century
   were offset to some extent by an increase in numbers breeding on
   mainland sites, especially around greater Cape Town and along the south
   coast. The proportion of Kelp Gulls breeding on the south coast
   increased from 15\% in 2000/2001-2004/2005 to 44\% in
   2009/2010-2013/2014. As there are fewer islands off the south coast than
   the west coast of South Africa, the proportion of Kelp Gulls breeding at
   mainland sites as opposed to island localities increased from 12\% in
   2000 to 31\% in 2014. Mainland colonies are more susceptible to
   disturbance by humans and predation by mainland carnivores, but, in
   spite of this, the generalist Kelp Gull has performed better in recent
   years than several specialist, endemic seabirds. At Dyer Island and Bird
   Island (Algoa Bay), where Kelp Gull numbers increased, predation by Kelp
   Gulls on eggs and chicks of threatened seabirds is thought to have
   contributed to decreases in these seabirds, and controls on Kelp Gulls
   have been reintroduced.}},

Abstract = {{In South America, Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) breed from Chilean
   Tierra del Fuego north to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the Atlantic coast
   and to Piura, Peru, on the Pacific coast. This review presents the first
   synthesis of information on the distribution and size of Kelp Gull
   colonies at the country level in coastal environments of Uruguay, Chile
   and Peru; provides an update on the breeding situation of the species in
   Brazil and Argentina; and allows the first evaluation of the overall
   coastal breeding population in South America. The breeding population in
   South America is now estimated to number at least 160,000 pairs. The
   largest population (at least 106,000 breeding pairs) is found in
   Argentina. Colonies of more than 1,000 pairs are uncommon. Population
   trends differed among coastal sectors, and important increases in
   numbers and formation of new colonies were only observed in Argentina.
   Available information suggests that predictable and abundant
   anthropogenic food subsidies, such as fishery discards and urban waste,
   are key factors contributing to the population growth in some coastal
   sectors. There is no strong evidence that Kelp Gulls are currently
   expanding their breeding range. However, given the population expansion
   in some areas and the potential conflicts with humans, ongoing
   monitoring efforts and population evaluations are necessary as they will
   provide the information required to support management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale relationships between changes in abundance of coastal
   breeding Herring (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed (L. marinus)
   gulls and commercial fisheries landings of bottom-dwelling groundfish
   spanning 28 years in four of Canada's east coast Provinces were
   investigated. Herring and Great Black-backed gull abundance data were
   compared between survey periods prior to (1986-1990) and following
   (2002-2006 and 2010-2014) the widespread reduction of groundfish fishing
   activities due to a moratorium that began in 1992. Regionwide declines
   in the number of breeding Herring and Great Black-backed gulls were
   observed between the 1986-1990 and 2002-2006 survey periods (Herring
   Gull: -3.7\% per year; Great Black-backed Gull: -3.6\% per year) and
   between the two periods following the moratorium (Herring Gull: -1.6\%
   per year; Great Black-backed Gull: -4.1\% per year). Total groundfish
   landings reported for the study area declined by 76\% between the
   1990-1992 and 2002-2006 fishing periods, and declined by an additional
   25\% between the two periods following the moratorium. A positive
   relationship was found between Province-wide groundfish landings and the
   number of breeding Great Black-backed Gulls corrected for coastline
   length. These results support the hypothesis that the moratorium reduced
   the availability of discards, which in turn played a role in the
   region's widespread decline of breeding Herring and Great Black-backed
   gull populations. In addition to continued declines in available
   discards, additional factors are likely influencing recent regional
   breeding population trends, including declines in available refuse and
   forage fish and increases in novel food sources such as expanding
   American mink (Neovison vison) farms.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions in eastern Newfoundland have changed
   considerably since the 1970s, as both bottom-up oceanographic and
   anthropogenic influences on seabird populations have fluctuated
   considerably. The diet, reproductive success, and presumably survival of
   gulls are intrinsically linked to these processes, and breeding
   populations have declined considerably through the 1980s and 1990s. To
   assess the populations of breeding large gulls in the Witless Bay
   Ecological Reserve in eastern Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, nests
   were surveyed and clutch size determined for Herring Gulls (Larus
   argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) breeding on Great,
   Gull, and Pee Pee Islands in 2011-2012. The total number of breeding
   gulls of these two species combined decreased by 41\% on Gull Island,
   78\% on Great Island and 51\% on Pee Pee Island since 2000. However, the
   declines differed among habitat type, with modest declines on puffin
   slopes (-15\% to -52\%) and the steepest declines in meadows (-70\% to
   -88\%), suggesting that large-scale causative factors are not solely
   responsible for changes in population size. Clutch size did not differ
   from that in 2000. Differential recruitment among highly philopatric
   gulls stemming from bottom-up diet-related variation in breeding success
   may be responsible for different changes in populations among different
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The diets of gulls (Laridae) can have consequences for reproductive
   success, chick growth, and survival, yet there have been no quantitative
   assessments in eastern Newfoundland since the early 1970s. The diet of
   Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) was examined through regurgitated prey
   items and pellets on Gull Island, Witless Bay, Newfoundland and
   Labrador, Canada, in 2012, and compared with similar data from
   1970-1971. There was a significant shift in Herring Gull diet
   composition from blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and capelin (Mallotus
   villosus) in the 1970s to garbage and Common Murre (Uria aalge) eggs in
   2012. Delays in capelin spawning and the large increase in breeding
   Common Murres on Gull Island are likely factors influencing Herring Gull
   diet. Garbage, which includes human food scraps as well as plastic
   debris, now constitutes the single largest diet item for Herring Gulls,
   corresponding with a global increase in plastic pollution. The
   consistently low contribution of fisheries discards suggests that
   changes in fishing practices and availability of discards are only one
   possible factor in the Herring Gull decline in Witless Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) have been banded in large numbers in
   eastern North America for over a century, and much has been learned
   about their movements and non-breeding distributions. To see if changes
   have occurred in the non-breeding distribution of Herring Gulls,
   encounters of birds banded as chicks at the Witless Bay Ecological
   Reserve in eastern Newfoundland, Canada, were examined. Extensive
   banding activities occurred during 1966-1978 and most recently during
   1999-2013 at this site. Overall, the patterns of encounter distributions
   have not changed greatly between the two time periods, in spite of the
   changes to the climate, marine ecosystems and land-use practices in the
   last 40 years (1966-1978 to 1999-2013). It appears that the migration
   habits of Herring Gulls breeding in Newfoundland are well established,
   and a northward shift in the non-breeding distribution, like that seen
   in several coastal bird species, was not apparent.}},

Title = {{l Forty-year Decline of Organic Contaminants in Eggs of Herring Gulls

Abstract = {{Following the discovery of widespread adverse reproductive effects in
   fish-eating colonial waterbirds nesting in the Canadian Great Lakes,
   Environment Canada started monitoring contaminants in Herring Gull
   (Larus argentatus) eggs in 1974. Current and historical concentrations
   and rates of decline of legacy contaminants (Polychlorinated Biphenyls
   {[}PCBs], 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin {[}TCDD] and
   organochlorine pesticides) in Herring Gull eggs from 15 Great Lakes
   colonies over 40 years are reported here. Large declines in contaminant
   concentrations were found in all colonies from the first year of
   reporting to 2013, with mean percent declines ranging from 72.7\% for
   Sigma chlordane to 95.2\% for Mirex, indicating reduced availability of
   contaminants to wildlife. First-order exponential decay regressions
   indicated that rates of decline in eggs varied among compounds. Herring
   Gulls from Strachan Island (St. Lawrence River), for example, had the
   highest rates of decline for Dieldrin and Hexachlor Epoxide, whereas
   those from Middle Island (Lake Erie) had the lowest rates of decline for
   TCDD and PCBs, and those from Gull Island (Lake Michigan) had the lowest
   rates of decline for HCB and Mirex. Exponential rates of decline in
   Herring Gulls mirrored those previously reported for Great Lakes fish,
   thus demonstrating that Herring Gulls are a good fish-eating indicator
   species.}},

Abstract = {{In 2001-2002, Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus) eggs from Lake
   Ontario had significantly higher concentrations of organochlorine
   contaminants than Herring Gull (L. argentatus) eggs. This study
   investigated whether higher contaminants in Great Black-backed Gulls
   affected immunocompetence, packed cell volume (PCV) and body condition
   in chicks, endocrine disruption and body condition in adults, and
   reproductive success. Variables were compared between species at two
   Lake Ontario sites (one in Ontario, Canada, and one in New York, USA),
   and with a control site in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. For Herring Gull
   chicks, body condition and total antibody titers to sheep red blood
   cells were greater at one contaminated site; PCV, phytohemagglutinin-P
   stimulation and reproductive output did not differ among sites. For
   Great Black-backed Gull chicks, PCV was significantly lower at one
   contaminated site; there were no other significant differences among
   sites. Between species, Herring Gull chicks had significantly higher
   antibody responses to sheep red blood cells at two sites and higher PCV
   at one site. Vitellogenin was not detected in the plasma of any adult
   males. Body condition of adult male Herring Gulls was significantly
   greater on Lake Ontario than in the Bay of Fundy control site. High
   contaminant concentrations in Great Black-backed Gull eggs from Lake
   Ontario were not associated with differences in phytohemagglutinin-P
   stimulation or body condition in chicks, nor with differences in
   reproductive output, compared with Herring Gulls, or with Great
   Black-backed Gulls at a control site.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive understanding of the potential threats faced by seabirds
   requires information on their distribution and abundance in the marine
   environment where they spend a significant part of their life cycle.
   Data collected from shipboard seabird surveys from 2006-2014 were
   examined to identify high density marine areas in eastern Canada for
   Herring (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed (L. marinus) gulls
   during the non-breeding season. The relative importance of these
   offshore areas was also compared to those used by Herring and Great
   Black-backed gulls in previous decades based on data collected from
   1965-1992. Results show that both Herring and Great Black-backed gulls
   were broadly distributed over shelf waters throughout Atlantic Canada
   during the non-breeding season, as well as in the southern Gulf of St.
   Lawrence and the maritime St. Lawrence Estuary. These two species of
   gulls were also found to use the deeper slope waters, beyond the shelf
   break. The relative importance of different offshore areas for both
   species has changed over time, with decreases observed around the island
   of Newfoundland and on parts of the Scotian Shelf. An assessment of the
   overall vulnerability of Herring and Great Black-backed gull populations
   outside the breeding season will require continued monitoring at sea,
   integration of multiple datasets, and a comprehensive analysis of human
   activities offshore.}},

Abstract = {{While the breeding ecology of gulls (Laridae) has been well studied,
   their movements and spatial organization during the non-breeding season
   is poorly understood. The seasonal movements, winter-site fidelity, and
   site persistence of Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and Herring (L.
   argentatus) gulls to wintering areas were studied from 2008-2012.
   Satellite transmitters were deployed on Ring-billed Gulls (n = 21) and
   Herring Gulls (n = 14). Ten Ring-billed and six Herring gulls were
   tracked over multiple winters and > 300 wing-tagged Ring- billed Gulls
   were followed to determine winter-site fidelity and persistence. Home
   range overlap for individuals between years ranged between 0-1.0 (95\%
   minimum convex polygon) and 0.31-0.79 (kernel utilization
   distributions). Ring-billed and Herring gulls remained at local
   wintering sites during the non-breeding season from 20-167 days and
   74161 days, respectively. The probability of a tagged Ring- billed Gull
   returning to the same site in subsequent winters was high; conversely,
   there was a low probability of a Ring- billed Gull returning to a
   different site. Ring- billed and Herring gulls exhibited high
   winter-site fidelity, but exhibited variable site persistence during the
   winter season, leading to a high probability of encountering the same
   individuals in subsequent winters.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in gull (Laridae) populations through the 20th century,
   largely due to an upsurge in anthropogenic food sources, has raised
   concerns about the effects of gulls on sympatric populations of other
   seabirds. In Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, a reduction in fisheries
   discards due to the collapse of cod (Gadus morhua) populations and a
   phenological delay in the early 1990s and early 2000s in spawning
   capelin (Mallotus villosus) has supposedly resulted in increased seabird
   predation by gulls. Accordingly, the diet of Great Black-backed Gulls
   (Larus marinus) was quantified at two colonies (Gull Island, Witless
   Bay, Newfoundland, and Gannet Islands, Labrador), and the total
   mortality on sympatric breeding seabirds at each site was extrapolated.
   At the Gannet Islands, Great Black-backed Gulls primarily
   kleptoparasitized Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) bringing
   sandlance (Ammodytes sp.) to their chicks, whereas at Gull Island,
   seabirds formed the bulk of the gulls' diet. Great Black-backed Gulls
   preferred murre (Uria spp.) eggs at both sites, selecting them in far
   greater proportion than their abundance, consuming up to 40\% of Common
   Murre (U. aalge) eggs laid on Gull Island. Great Black-backed Gulls also
   targeted Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) eggs, chicks, and
   adults at Gull Island. Great Black-backed Gulls clearly selected certain
   seabird prey disproportionately to their availability, but likely have
   not had significant effects on the populations of other sympatric
   seabirds, with the possible exception of Black-legged Kittiwakes, which
   declined significantly from the 1970s to the early 2000s.}},

Abstract = {{Morphology, body condition and survival of Great Black-backed Gull
   (Larus marinus) chicks raised in broods of different size in southern
   New Brunswick, Canada, were compared. The relationship between age and
   body size measurements taken from 68 chicks, between 0 and 56 days of
   age, was analyzed. The logistic model provided the best fit of the
   morphological measurements (culmen, tarsus, and wing) to age, and the
   Gompertz model provided the best fit of body mass to age. These models
   were used to make linear transformations of body size variables that
   were used in subsequent analysis. There was no difference in the
   morphology of chicks raised in broods of different size. The first
   principle component (PC1) from the correlation matrix of the three
   transformed morphological variables was used as covariate in subsequent
   analysis to remove variation in body mass that was caused by differences
   in body size. All chicks were in the same relative body condition at
   hatch. Body condition of chicks raised in one-chick broods improved with
   age, that of chicks raised in two-chick broods did not change, but body
   condition of chicks from broods of three declined with age. In contrast,
   chicks from larger broods were more likely to survive the nestling
   period. Although body condition was lower in chicks from larger broods,
   other factors unrelated to body condition, such as differences in
   parental quality, led to higher survival for chicks in broods of three.}},

Abstract = {{Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gull (L. marinus)
   morphometric data from various eastern North American locations was
   collected to examine the sources of variation in body size within and
   among geographic regions. For Herring Gulls, significant differences in
   all commonly taken measurements at local and regional scales were found.
   However, most of the variation in measurements was due to sex
   differences and the natural variance seen within local populations.
   Herring Gulls breeding in the Arctic did not show any evidence of being
   morphologically different from other groups. A discriminant function
   derived from a Newfoundland, Canada, breeding population of Herring
   Gulls successfully assigned the sex of birds in Atlantic Canada and
   Nunavut, Canada, further emphasizing that most of the variation seen is
   between sexes and not among local or even regional populations. It also
   indicates that the evitable variation introduced by inter-individual
   differences in measurements was insufficient to compromise the utility
   of the discriminant function. The correct classification rate was lower
   for Great Lakes breeding Herring Gulls, indicating that these birds have
   different morphologies than those of populations in easterly regions. In
   contrast, few differences and no clear geographic patterns were found in
   measurements for Great Black-backed Gulls. These results were consistent
   with recent genetic information, suggesting an older west to east
   radiation of Herring Gulls across North America and a lack of isolation
   among Great Black-Backed Gull populations.}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing among eggs of large gull species in mixed colonies is
   difficult because egg size is variable, size ranges overlap and colors
   are similar. Regional and yearly differences in egg size of Herring
   Gulls (Larus argentatus) were compared among three regions (Bay of
   Fundy, Newfoundland, and low Arctic). In two of these regions
   (Newfoundland and Bay of Fundy), eggs of Herring Gulls and Great
   Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) were measured and discriminant analysis
   models were created to distinguish between the eggs of these two
   species. Egg dimensions of Herring Gulls decreased from low Arctic
   (largest) to Bay of Fundy to Newfoundland (smallest). In both species,
   where a = first-laid egg, b = second-laid, and c = third-laid, a-and
   b-eggs were of similar size, but c-eggs were significantly smaller;
   measurements of a-and b-eggs were pooled. The only annual differences
   were in a-and b-eggs (treated separately) in Newfoundland; there were no
   annual differences in c-eggs or in a/b-eggs combined. There were
   regional differences in a/b-eggs combined, but not in c-eggs. Three
   separate discriminant function models were created for Newfoundland
   a/b-eggs, Bay of Fundy a/b-eggs, and Newfoundland/Bay of Fundy c-eggs.
   Models discriminated 90\% or more of the eggs. Length and diameter
   differ between species and must both be measured to discriminate between
   Herring and Great Black-backed gull eggs; diameter alone is not
   reliable. Future application of such models will improve identification
   of clutches in field situations and lead to more accurate gull
   population estimates.}},

Abstract = {{In response to human activity and ecosystem changes, large gulls in
   eastern North America have shown a variety of population trends over the
   last 100 years. Seven years of capture-mark-recapture data were analyzed
   for Herring (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed (L. marinus) gulls
   breeding in eastern Newfoundland, Canada to estimate apparent survival
   and survival rates. Estimated survival was 0.864 for Great Black-backed
   Gulls and 0.837 for Herring Gulls. For both species, the survival rate
   calculated using live and dead encounters was higher than the apparent
   survival rate calculated from resighting data only and added almost an
   additional year of expected life. While these values are in the range of
   survival rates reported from other studies along the eastern coast of
   North America, the values for Herring Gulls were lower than survival
   rates reported elsewhere in North America and Europe. The lower survival
   rates seen in eastern North American Herring Gulls may be attributable
   to characteristics of the migration and wintering habitat, including
   poorer habitat quality (i.e., highly developed and industrialized east
   coast) and possibly gull (Laridae) control programs.}},

Abstract = {{The Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens) inhabits Cuban coastal saline
   habitats, although the number of individuals and specific breeding and
   foraging locations are largely unknown. Unpublished fieldwork data, as
   well as data coming from scientific literature, zoological collections
   and eBird, were collated to assess the Reddish Egret breeding population
   and number of foraging individuals in Cuba. A total of 155 breeding
   pairs, which represent 3\% of the estimated global population and 22\%
   of the estimated regional population (i.e., Eastern Management Unit),
   were confirmed. Most of the breeding reports were distributed within the
   Sabana-Camaguey archipelago (54\%, n=13 breeding areas). Foraging
   Reddish Egrets were common throughout Cuba's coastal saline habitats and
   were documented in most of the localities referred to in published and
   unpublished sources (88\%, n=65 sites). These observations accounted for
   a maximum of 544 birds (n=20 sites), which represent 7-10\% of the
   global population estimate. Four of the foraging sites accounted for
   69\% (n = 544) of the overall foraging population.}},

Abstract = {{In birds where males and females are similar in size and plumage, sex
   determination by alternative means is necessary. Discriminant function
   analysis based on external morphometrics was used to distinguish males
   from females in two closely related species: Western Grebe (Aechmophorus
   occidentalis) and Clark's Grebe (A. clarkii). Additionally, discriminant
   function analysis was used to evaluate morphometric divergence between
   Western and Clark's grebe adults and eggs. Aechmophorus grebe adults (n
   = 576) and eggs (n = 130) were sampled across 29 lakes and reservoirs
   throughout California, USA, and adult sex was determined using molecular
   analysis. Both Western and Clark's grebes exhibited considerable sexual
   size dimorphism. Males averaged 6-26\% larger than females among seven
   morphological measurements, with the greatest sexual size dimorphism
   occurring for bill morphometrics. Discriminant functions based on bill
   length, bill depth, and short tarsus length correctly assigned sex to
   98\% of Western Grebes, and a function based on bill length and bill
   depth correctly assigned sex to 99\% of Clark's Grebes. Further, a
   simplified discriminant function based only on bill depth correctly
   assigned sex to 96\% of Western Grebes and 98\% of Clark's Grebes. In
   contrast, external morphometrics were not suitable for differentiating
   between Western and Clark's grebe adults or their eggs, with correct
   classification rates of discriminant functions of only 60\%, 63\%, and
   61\% for adult males, adult females, and eggs, respectively. Our results
   indicate little divergence in external morphology between species of
   Aechmophorus grebes, and instead separation is much greater between
   males and females.}},

Pages = {{27-33}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Male and female Dunlin (Calidris alpina) exhibit slight plumage and
   structural differences. Discriminant function analysis based on
   morphological characteristics can effectively differentiate between
   sexes in several subspecies of Dunlin. We assessed the level of sexual
   size dimorphism in a subspecies that breeds in sub-Arctic Canada (C. a.
   hudsonia), and used discriminant function analysis to create equations
   to classify individuals to sex using five body measurements (body mass,
   head length, culmen length, tarsus length, and flattened wing chord).
   Females were significantly larger than males for all body measurements.
   Discriminant function analysis using tarsus length, head length, and
   body mass correctly classified 87.1\% of molecularly sexed females (n =
   31) and 92.6\% of males (n = 27). The classification of an independent
   sample (n = 12) resulted in 100.0\% correct assignment of sex with
   33.3\% of individuals falling within the undetermined range. A
   discriminant function analysis equation is provided for use with
   non-breeding populations using only structural characteristics with
   classification accuracies of 83.9\% for females and 81.5\% for males.
   The resulting equations from this study have classification accuracies
   comparable to those equations developed for other Dunlin subspecies and
   can be used to reliably differentiate sexes of C. a. hudsonia using body
   measurements collected in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Allometric scaling law predicts that herbivores respond differently to
   the availability of resources, mediated by body size. However, studies
   of allometric responses have often focused on animals with a relatively
   large difference in body size. Here, using a correlative field study,
   habitat use by two herbivorous species, the Bean Goose (Anser fabalis)
   and the Greater White-fronted Goose (A. albifrons), with a relatively
   small difference in body size was investigated during the wintering
   period. Both a generalized linear mixed model and a mixed logistic
   regression model showed that both species selected lower lying areas
   that were recently exposed, and, as expected, the smaller Greater
   White-fronted Goose showed a stronger selection of foraging habitat than
   the larger Bean Goose. Sward height also influenced habitat selection by
   both species, and the smaller species selected shorter swards than the
   larger species. In terms of forage quality, both models failed to detect
   a significant effect of nitrogen content on goose habitat selection. A
   logistic regression model showed that structural heterogeneity of the
   sward negatively correlated with the patch selection of the smaller
   species, but for the larger species such a correlation was not found. In
   agreement with our hypotheses, our results provide some preliminary
   indication that coexistence of the two goose species studied here might
   be mediated by an allometric response even if the difference in body
   size is relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal Louisiana has suffered from dramatic coastal land loss.
   Following translocations to Louisiana in the late 1960s, Brown Pelican
   (Pelecanus occidentalis) colonies were annually surveyed between 1971
   and 2010 using aerial methods. The goals of this study were to describe
   long-term Brown Pelican colony dynamics, investigate physical changes to
   nesting islands via satellite imagery, and relate colony dynamics to
   physical island changes. Thirty Brown Pelican colonies were found, with
   a mean colony persistence of 5.5 years. Following exponential growth up
   to 2000, nesting plateaued, declined sharply in 2006 primarily due to
   land losses following the intense 2005 hurricane season, and stabilized
   at lower levels until 2010. From 1998 to 2010, island size decreased by
   a mean of 68.7\%, with 10 of the islands vanishing entirely. Colony size
   was positively correlated to island size. Colonies did not shift between
   State regions, but appeared to shift within regions. To persist in
   Louisiana, Brown Pelicans will need to continue adjusting to a changing
   coastline, as well as planned coastal restoration projects. Future
   monitoring of Brown Pelicans in Louisiana may provide insight into their
   adaptive responses to changing availability and suitability of nesting
   island habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Refuge in Louisiana, USA, constitutes
   a major colonial waterbird breeding site, and several restoration
   projects have been undertaken to sustain waterbird populations on the
   refuge. However, very little is known about food resources that colonial
   waterbirds depend on in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal (Thalasseus maximus)
   and Sandwich (T. sandvicensis) tern diet composition was investigated to
   determine important food resources during the breeding period.
   Regurgitated prey items in the 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons were used
   to compare diet composition, prey item frequency, and prey item mass
   among four groups: Royal Tern adults, Royal Tern chicks, Sandwich Tern
   adults, and Sandwich Tern chicks. The two most frequent prey items were
   Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulates) and bay anchovy (Anchoa
   mitchilli). Royal Tern adults consumed significantly more Sciaenids than
   any other tern group, and Sandwich Tern adults consumed more Engraulids
   than any other tern group. Royal and Sandwich tern adults partitioned
   food resources by prey species and prey size, while chick diet showed
   more overlap in prey species composition. Royal and Sandwich tern diet
   closely reflected the species composition of trawls from nearby waters,
   suggesting opportunistic prey selection. The diets of both tern species
   contained a variety of demersal prey items indicating use of discards
   from local fisheries activities. Interactions between breeding
   waterbirds and fisheries in coastal Louisiana may be an important
   conservation consideration with profound implications on breeding
   abundance and breeding success of waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{The Gray Gull (Leucophaeus modestus) has the unique habit among gulls of
   nesting in the interior Atacama Desert, up to 100 km from the coast.
   During the 2014-2015 austral breeding season, two breeding colonies were
   recorded on the coast within 90 m of the shoreline in the Antofagasta
   Region, northern Chile. The new colonies ranged in size from 40 (Playa
   Grande) to 150 (Playa Brava) nests. Egg laying was synchronous in both
   colonies and most likely occurred in late November 2014, coinciding with
   egg laying in desert colonies. The colony at Playa Brava was successful,
   but the one at Playa Grande was deserted due to feral dog (Canis
   familiaris) attacks. The habitat used by Gray Gulls resembled that
   reported for desert colonies, with flat plains covered with small rocks,
   which provide protection to chicks from intense solar radiation. This
   unusual coastal nesting behavior could result in the modification of
   certain life history and behavioral traits in the Gray Gull (e.g., chick
   growth rates, energy expenditure, and foraging ranges), which have
   evolved to breed in severe desert conditions. We suggest that coastal
   breeding is adopted by Gray Gulls during El Nino years in response to
   reduced food supply. During El Nino years, Gray Gulls would move to the
   coast where access to food is better and thermoregulatory costs are
   lower, but predation is higher. During non-El Nino years, Gray Gulls
   would resume their ancestral desert-nesting strategy in which traveling
   distances between the coast and nesting grounds are considerable and
   thermoregulatory costs are higher, but predation risks are lower. Future
   observations should confirm if Gray Gulls continue breeding at coastal
   sites during El Nino years or if this becomes a regular behavior
   independent of oceanographic conditions.}},

Title = {{Influence of Shelterbelts on Success and Density of Waterfowl Nests

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Shelterbelts are long rows of trees planted in the Great Plains of North
   America to reduce wind erosion of soil. Shelterbelts alter airflow,
   creating updrafts on the windward side (updraft zone), slow winds
   immediately on the leeward side (calm zone), and increased turbulence
   farther downwind of the shelterbelt (turbulent zone). They also provide
   hunting perches for avian predators and serve as corridors for mammalian
   predators. By determining the fate of 247 duck nests located in 27
   Waterfowl Production Areas during 2006 and 2007, this study tested the
   hypothesis that duck nests located close to shelterbelts are more likely
   to be depredated than nests located in open fields and that nest
   densities are lower near shelterbelts than in open fields. Nest density
   in a shelterbelt's calm zone (0.22 nests/ha) was lower than in open
   fields (1.02 nest/ha). Shelterbelt orientation and porosity to airflow
   did not affect nest success or nest density. Shelterbelt height did not
   influence nest density, but nest success decreased as shelterbelts
   increased in height. Depredation rates were higher for nests near
   isolated structures (e.g., isolated trees, snags, and utility poles)
   than for nests near shelterbelts or in open fields.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) are intensely managed
   through culling in North America to reduce presumed damage to commercial
   and natural resources. To evaluate this management, there is a critical
   need to understand the reproductive biology of Double-crested
   Cormorants. Gonadal development, reproductive potential and breeding
   status were determined by necropsy for 1,781 DOuble-crested Cormorants
   salvaged each month of the year from control programs in their wintering
   and breeding ranges in seven States in the USA. Gonadal development of
   males peaked earlier in the year than females. Mean and maximum
   reproductive potential was five and 13 ovum, respectively. The average
   proportion of non-breeding female Double-crested Cormorants culled from
   breeding colonies was 14.9\% (n = 202) and from foraging flocks on the
   breeding grounds was 22.1\% (n = 358). This demographic information
   should be considered when evaluating and modeling effects of
   Double-crested Cormorant management in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Small sized, man-made, perennial and primarily rain-fed ponds occur
   widely in the rural landscape of India. These wetlands provide suitable
   habitats and food resources for a wide variety of resident and migratory
   wetland birds. Wetland birds in six rural ponds of Kurukshetra District,
   Haryana, in northern India were surveyed from April 2011 to May 2014 to
   determine status. Point counts and direct observations were used to
   record bird species. Sixty-nine species of wetland birds belonging to 47
   genera and 20 families were identified. Family Anatidae dominated the
   avifauna with 20\% (n = 14) of the species found. Of the species
   documented, 54\% (n = 37) were winter migrants, 7\% (n = 5) were summer
   migrants and 39\% (n = 27) were residents. Among recorded species,
   Darter (Anhinga melanogaster), Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala),
   Oriental White This ( Threskiornis melanocephalus) and River Tern
   (Sterna aurantia) are considered as near threatened; Comb Duck
   (Sarkidiornis melanotos), Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus) and Eurasian
   Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) are listed in Appendix II of the
   Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
   and Flora. The occurrence of migrants and special-status species
   documents the importance of these rural ponds as habitats for wetland
   birds in India. However, anthropogenic and developmental activities in
   and around these ponds are posing significant threats. The present study
   provides baseline information on wetland birds of these ponds for future
   monitoring, conservation planning and the development of pertinent
   management interventions.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out at Ichkeul National Park, Tunisia, during
   2009 and 2010. The influence of environmental variables on the foraging
   behavior of three Ardeid species was studied. Grey Herons (Ardea
   cinerea) were the least active of the three species, having the greatest
   resting percentages in 2009 (55.0\%) and 2010 (64.9\%); they primarily
   used the ``standing and wait{''} hunting behavior (68.5\%). Great Egrets
   (A. alba) (93.6\%) and Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) (86.5\%)
   primarily adopted a ``walking slowly{''} strategy. Little Egrets also
   frequently used the ``walking quickly{''} behavior, a more active
   hunting technique. Both Little and Great egrets varied their hunting
   behaviors according to water depth. In shallows, they used the ``walking
   quickly{''} behavior, while in deeper waters they used the ``standing
   and wait{''} behavior (Little Egret: r=-0.26, P<0.001; Great Egret:
   r=-0.44, P<0.01). For Little Egrets only, high temperature (F=42.77, df
   = 1, P < 0.001) and high wind velocity (F=63.81, df = 1, P < 0.001)
   promoted an active ``walking quickly{''} hunting behavior, while high
   light intensity frequently promoted the ``standing and wait{''} and
   ``walking slowly{''} behaviors (F=5.48, df = 1, P < 0.05). Received 1
   January 2015, accepted 2 October 2015.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) in western Mexico is
   limited to a few known sites from Guerrero to Chiapas. However, except
   for nesting at one Oaxaca site in 2005, all the colonies were reported
   over 35 years ago, while more recently published bird surveys in coastal
   wetlands of western Mexico have not reported any nesting Wood Storks.
   During April 2014, a newly established colony at Mogote Prieto, a
   mangrove-fringed island in Laguna Cuyudan's Basin III, Colima, was
   documented. This colony was visited on seven occasions during the spring
   and summer of 2014 and 2015. Maximum numbers in 2014 were 300 adult Wood
   Storks, including 36 clearly on nests and four carrying nesting
   materials (15 April 2014); 17 large, feathered chicks (12 June 2014);
   and 15 fledglings (12 July 2014). During 2015, there were fewer adults
   and nests, but more fledglings (n = 25 on 20 July 2015). Although the
   source of the nesting adults cannot be established, attention should be
   given to the conservation of this Wood Stork colony in western Mexico.}},

   Reserve, Tibet, China, to examine the effect of group size on vigilance
   behavior at both the individual and group levels. At the individual
   level, individual Black-necked Cranes in large social groups spent less
   time in vigilant behavior than when in small family groups. At the
   social group level, the proportion of vigilant individuals decreased,
   while the proportion of intervals that at least one individual was
   vigilant increased, with increasing group size. There was a significant
   group size effect on vigilance behavior in wintering Black-necked Cranes

Abstract = {{Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are primarily monogamous birds that
   usually raise only one brood per season, but rare instances of double
   brooding have been documented. Piping Plovers breeding in the northern
   Great Plains, USA were studied in two locations: the Missouri River near
   the Gavins Point Dam (2005-2013) and the lower Platte River (2008-2013).
   There were 25 confirmed instances of double brooding on the Missouri
   River across the 9-year duration of the study. There were no instances
   of double brooding observed locally on the lower Platte River. However,
   in 2013, two female Piping Plovers successfully hatched eggs and fledged
   chicks from nests on the lower Platte River and later were observed
   nesting for a second time on the Missouri River. Factors predicted to
   increase the frequency of double brooding are: early nest initiation,
   male biased sex ratio, age of breeding adults, and decreased nesting
   density. Our results indicate density is an important factor that
   accounts for some of the difference in the proportion of double brooding
   on the Missouri River compared to the lower Platte River. It is likely a
   combination of factors is responsible for this behavior, previously
   thought to be rare, in Piping Plovers.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging habitat use by colonial waterbirds breeding in New York Harbor
   was examined to identify resources that were particularly important for
   the provisioning of young. Stable isotope values of carbon, nitrogen,
   and sulfur were measured in nestling waterbird feathers to determine the
   habitat type (ranging from marine to freshwater and anthropogenic) in
   which adults primarily foraged. Six species were investigated:
   Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Egrets (Ardea
   alba), Glossy Ibises (Plegadis falcinellus), Double-crested Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax auritus), Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus), and
   Herring Gulls (L. argentatus). Waterbird populations exhibited both
   inter-and intra-specific variation in stable isotope values (P < 0.001),
   indicating variation in foraging habitat use among focal species across
   the estuary. Therefore, depending on the species-and region-specific
   conservation goal, management strategies would potentially need to
   target very different foraging habitats for protection and remediation.
   For instance, habitat use by Double-crested Cormorants closely reflected
   available habitat near nesting colonies, while Glossy Ibises used
   primarily freshwater resources at one colony and marine resources at
   another, despite the fact that both colonies were located in marine
   environments. Great Egrets and Double-crested Cormorants both showed
   significant regional variation in isotopic niche size, and both species
   of gulls (considered to be generalist scavengers) were found to have
   isotopic niche sizes reflecting a specialist diet. Stable isotope
   analysis of nestling feathers provided novel information about the
   foraging resources that were most important to waterbirds in regions
   across the harbor.}},

Title = {{Re-evaluation of the Role of Landfills and Culling in the Historic
   Changes in the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) Population in Great
   Britain}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{339-354}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the reasons behind the large population explosion of
   the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) in Great Britain, which started
   about 1900, continued for 60-70 years and was then followed by a decline
   in numbers. The increase has often been associated with food obtained at
   landfills, but it is better explained by other causes because such sites
   were not used for feeding until the increase had been in progress for 50
   years and for less than 20 years before gull numbers started to decline.
   Further, the flock and frenzy method of feeding used by Herring Gulls at
   landfills is not well adapted for the successful exploitation of this
   food source, and the frequency of use has often been exaggerated. The
   historic increase in Herring Gulls starting in about 1900 should be
   attributed to protection and then food acquired from the marine
   environment, including fishing offal, and increased feeding on
   agricultural land. Culling has contributed more to the recent decline of
   the population than has been previously assessed because of secrecy and
   lack of detail about many such events. Feeding at landfills may have
   been detrimental to the Herring Gull population owing to increased
   mortality from botulism acquired there. It is concluded that culling and
   botulism both contributed appreciably to the end of the population
   explosion that occurred around 1970, and to the subsequent decline of
   the Herring Gull in Great Britain. The increase and continued spread of
   Herring Gulls nesting in urban areas in Great Britain cannot be
   explained by food obtained within the towns. Observations that, in some
   areas, most of these gulls rarely fed at landfill sites, and so avoided
   botulism, may account for their continued increase in urban areas.}},

   during the breeding season; two additional species were documented only
   in migration. The most abundant species was the Snowy Egret (Egretta
   thula), which had a peak of 234 nests in 2012. Of particular
   conservation interest is the Reddish Egret (E. rufescens), which had a
   peak of 149 nests in 2012. Potential prey of wading birds in the estuary
   was also sampled, with special focus on brachyuran crabs, which
   constitute the main prey items of the Yellow-crowned Night-Heron
   (Nyctanassa violacea). The rapid development of the region, and
   especially the establishment of large-scale mariculture operations along
   Estero Santa Cruz, has the potential to impact local wading bird
   populations, and thus an understanding of wading bird diversity,
   abundance and habitat use may prove critical to inform future management
   and conservation initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) populations have declined over much
   of their global range over the past 30 years and in Australia numbers
   fell by almost 40\% between 1977-1981 and 1998-2002. In Australia, loss
   of wetland area and quality in relation to river regulation for
   irrigated agriculture are the main suggested causes. The species' diet
   has been quantified in many areas, but there have been no detailed
   studies of its foraging habitat requirements upon which to base
   conservation measures. This study quantified foraging habitat selection
   at Fivebough Swamp, New South Wales, an internationally important
   feeding and roosting site for non-breeding Glossy Ibis. Typical of many
   floodplain wetlands in southeastern Australia, Fivebough Swamp is
   temporary, flooding during the wet season and drying during the hot
   summer. Glossy Ibis showed a strong preference for feeding in areas of
   water couch grass (Paspalum distichum) less than 10 cm tall interspersed
   among open water, and avoidance of areas dominated by bulrush (Typha
   spp.), common spike rush (Eleocharis acuta) and open non-vegetated
   water. Water couch grass supported significantly higher densities of
   aquatic macroinvertebrate prey for Glossy Ibis than did the other
   habitats, including Gastrodpoda, Hemiptera and Coleoptera. Water couch
   grass can form dense contiguous mats of up to 50 cm in height above
   water level, which would be too high and dense for Glossy Ibis to probe
   through. In the absence of natural herbivores, livestock grazing by
   cattle (Bos taurus) at low stocking rates can be used to suppress this
   growth and maintain suitable conditions for Glossy Ibis.}},

Abstract = {{Bird use of diked and undiked Michigan coastal wetlands (n = 17) was
   studied on Lake St. Clair and Lake Huron during late July to
   mid-October, 2005-2007. Relative abundance and diversity were compared
   via aerial (n = 9) and ground (n = 155) surveys and wetland
   characteristics were measured. Species richness and similarity indices
   suggested analogous bird use, but multivariate analyses indicated
   significant separation in diked and undiked bird assemblages. Wood Duck
   (Aix sponsa), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias), and Wilson's Snipe
   (Gallinago delicata) were more abundant on diked sites, whereas dabbling
   ducks combined, Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), American Black Duck (A.
   rubripes), gulls (Laridae), Forster's Tern (Sterna forsteri), and
   Greater Yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca) were more abundant on undiked
   wetlands. Wetland characteristics also differed. Diked sites were
   primarily cattail (Typha spp.) marshes interspersed with small
   open-water areas containing aquatic plants. Undiked sites had larger
   openings fringed with bulrushes (Schoenoplectus spp.), fewer aquatic
   plants, and direct lake connections. Periodic drawdowns of diked
   wetlands could encourage greater plant species and structural diversity,
   making them more attractive to dabbling ducks. However, risk of common
   reed (Phragmites australis) expansion is high in the study areas, thus
   its control may be necessary before enhanced management can occur.}},

Abstract = {{Apicomplexan blood parasites Plasmodium and Haemoproteus (together
   termed ``Avian malaria{''}) and Leucocytozoon are widespread, diverse
   vector-transmitted blood parasites of birds, and conditions associated
   with colonial nesting in herons (Ardeidae) and other waterbirds appear
   perfect for their transmission. Despite studies in other locations
   reporting high prevalence of parasites in juvenile herons, juvenile
   Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) previously tested in the Camargue,
   Southern France, had a total absence of malaria parasites. This study
   tested the hypotheses that this absence was due to insufficient
   sensitivity of the tests of infection; an absence of infective vectors;
   or testing birds too early in their lives. Blood was sampled from
   juveniles of four species shortly before fledging: Little Egret (n =
   40), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis; n = 40), Black-crowned Night-Heron
   (Nycticorax nycticorax; n = 40), and Squacco Heron (Ardeola ralloides; n
   = 40). Sensitive nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to test for
   the presence of parasites in both birds and host-seeking female
   mosquitoes captured around the colonies. No malaria infection was found
   of in any of the heron species. Four different lineages of Plasmodium
   were detected in pooled samples of female Culex pipiens mosquitoes,
   including two in potentially infective mosquitoes. These results confirm
   that the absence of malaria parasites previously demonstrated in Little
   Egret is not due to methodological limitations. Although the prevalence
   of infection in mosquitoes was low, conditions within the colonies were
   suitable for transmission of Plasmodium. These colonial heron species
   may have evolved strategies for resisting malaria infection through
   physiological or behavioral mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the Striated Heron (Butorides striata) was
   studied in the lagoon of the Reserve of the Universidad Nacional del
   Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina, during two breeding seasons: September
   2012-February 2013 (n = 77) and September 2013-March 2014 (n = 125). All
   nests (n = 202) were built on waxy-leaf nightshade (Solanum
   glaucophyllum) at 0.99 +/- 0.27 m above water level. The incubation
   period was 20-23 (21.71 +/- 1.57) days; laying and hatching took place
   on successive days. An average of 2.63 +/- 0.60 (Range = 2-4) opaque
   pale blue eggs were recorded per nest. Length, width and weight of eggs
   did not differ between seasons. Double (n = 43) and triple (n = 47)
   broods were recorded. A total of 631 eggs were monitored; no differences
   were detected in breeding, hatching, nesting, or fledging success
   between seasons. The time spent by chicks in the nest was 14.6 +/- 2.16
   days, and the average number of chicks per nest was 2.15 +/- 0.55.
   Age-specific mortality rate for eggs was 22\% and 38\% and for chicks
   47\% and 35\% for the first and second seasons, respectively. Sixty-one
   percent of nest failures were related to the disappearance of eggs or
   chicks from the nests, possibly due to predation or climatic factors.}},

Abstract = {{The Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens) is a species of conservation
   concern on an international scale, yet relatively little is known about
   its life history strategies and demographics. To estimate post-fledging
   survival and examine dispersal patterns/rates, Reddish Egrets (n = 30
   fledglings) were monitored and marked with VHF radio transmitters in the
   Laguna Madre, Texas, in 2006. Overall daily survival rate was 0.78 (SE =
   0.11). Reddish Egrets dispersed from their natal colony at 12-15 weeks
   after hatching, and the average distance traveled in the Laguna Madre
   ranged from 0 to 488 km. These results help fill a knowledge gap during
   this little-known time period of the Reddish Egret. Furthermore, these
   results show that the Laguna Madre is an important system during this
   critical stage of development as many of the juveniles remained in this
   lagoon through the duration of our 6-month study.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Cay Sal Bank in The Bahamas is one of the Caribbean region's most
   important areas for breeding seabirds, but the colonies previously
   lacked solid estimates. This paper describes results of four visits
   between 2010 and 2012. The Santaren Channel, used to transit to and from
   Cay Sal Bank, contained high numbers (6.1 +/- 0.4 birds per km(2)) of
   seabirds. The Cay Say Bank has at least 117 detectable islands with 484
   ha of land area; the most numerous colony was at Elbow Cay (23 ha).
   Audubon's Shearwaters (Puffinus lherminieri) were breeding at 97 pairs
   per ha (total: 2,200; 95\% CI = 1,650-2,800 pairs), Sooty Terns
   (Onychoprion fuscatus) at 382 pairs per ha (total: 8,800; 95\% CI =
   6,900-10,700 pairs), Bridled Terns (Onychoprion anaethetus) at 38 pairs
   per km coastline (5,829 m coastline; total: 220; 95\% CI = 145-295
   pairs) and Brown Noddies (Anous stolidus) at 72 pairs per ha (total:
   1,609; 95\% CI = 1,070-2,250 pairs). The population of Audubon's
   Shearwaters is among the largest in the world while populations of the
   other species are regionally significant. Roughly 420 ha (87\% of the
   available land) were visited; however, many of the smaller cays (43
   islands with 30 ha of habitat) have still not been surveyed. Seabirds
   were present in low densities (0.3-20 total pairs per ha) on the other
   large islands, all of which contain populations of introduced black
   (Rattus rattus) or Norway (R. norveigicus) rats. These visits provide
   the first repeatable surveys of breeding seabirds at Cay Sal Bank.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about sublethal effects on birds of low level exposure
   to oil. White blood cell parameters (total leukocyte counts and/or
   differentials) were measured in blood samples from Common Terns (Sterna
   hirundo; n = 71) exposed to low levels of oil from an oil spill in
   Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, in 2003. Data from Common Terns (n = 16)
   sampled at the same site in a non-spill year were used for reference.
   Total leukocytes and lymphocytes were severely depressed when
   individuals were first sampled, 14-20 days after the spill, and returned
   to near to or above reference levels by day 39. Heterophils and
   heterophil/lymphocyte ratios were markedly elevated 14-20 days after the
   spill, and returned to below reference levels by day 39. These changes
   were closely parallel to changes in hematocrit in the same birds, but
   hematocrits were not correlated with white blood cell parameters,
   suggesting that mechanisms of action were different. The combination of
   immune suppression and anemia during the physiologically demanding
   period prior to and during egg-laying is likely to have caused adverse
   effects on reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Leg-loop harnesses for the attachment of telemetry devices have been
   used for over two decades in terrestrial bird research. Recently, the
   technique has been extended to waterbird applications. An equation
   exists for predicting the dimensions of correctly fitting leg-loop
   harnesses in terrestrial bird research. This equation appears robust to
   the varied life histories of terrestrial birds. Yet, the applicability
   of this equation for waterbird research has not been tested. Here, we
   present the dimensions of leg-loop harnesses fitted to Lesser
   Frigatebirds (Fregata ariel), a sexually dimorphic seabird species. For
   both sexes, measured harness spans were shorter than those predicted by
   the terrestrial bird equation. Additionally, leg-loop harnesses trialed
   on Brown (Sula leucogaster) and Masked (S. dactylatra) boobies were
   unsuitable and hence unsuccessful. Morphological and behavioral features
   of species suited to leg-loop harness attachment are identified.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{427-430}},

Abstract = {{Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) breed mainly in central Canada and the
   north-central USA, and along both coasts of North America. In Mexico,
   only five nesting colonies were known prior to this study and all are
   coastal, three from Baja California, one from Colima on the Pacific
   coast, and one from Tamaulipas on the Gulf of Mexico. In 2014, a new
   inland colony was found at the Lake of Texcoco, east of Mexico City,
   Mexico. Eight nests that were located on small islets 400 m away from
   shore were monitored from April to June 2014. Almost 90\% of the eggs (n
   = 16) were lost by flooding, and only two chicks hatched. One chick died
   and the other survived to fledging, and at 25 days old it dispersed more
   than 3 km from the colony. This nesting colony at the Lake of Texcoco
   represents a new breeding site of Forster's Tern in Mexico, the first
   breeding record in an interior wetland of Mexico, and a southward
   expansion of the known breeding range for this species. These
   observations reinforce the importance of the Lake of Texcoco for
   breeding waterbirds in the Valley of Mexico.}},

Title = {{Adult Survival and Breeding Dispersal of Common Terns (Sterna hirundo)
   in a Declining Population}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The population of Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) in Barnegat Bay, New
   Jersey, USA, has recently experienced poor productivity with complete or
   near-complete breeding failure at multiple colonies; and the number of
   breeding pairs has declined. Adult Common Terns were captured and banded
   at Pettit Island from 2010 through 2014 and at four additional islands
   from 2011 through 2014. Although the number of breeding pairs on Pettit
   Island decreased and reproductive success was generally poor, this
   colony was more productive than the other colonies. Data from the other
   colonies were too sparse to treat each site separately, and the analysis
   is instead based on two ``locations{''}: Pettit Island and all other
   sites. Apparent survival and movement probabilities were estimated using
   multistate capture-recapture modeling based on recaptures combined with
   resighting of color-banded Common Terns. The two best supported models
   included location, transience, and presence or absence of color bands as
   variables and produced very similar parameter estimates. Adult survival
   at Pettit Island was estimated at approximately 0.88, which is within
   the range of previous estimates for Common Terns. Survival estimates for
   the other sites had high uncertainty but appeared to be very low, at
   approximately 0.71. There was no evidence that apparent survival changed
   across time (2010-2012 compared to 2012-2014). Movement probabilities
   suggest a frequency of breeding dispersal within Barnegat Bay above 6\%.
   Detection probabilities were much higher for color-marked birds than for
   those with metal bands only. Low apparent survival and decreases in the
   number of adults probably reflect permanent emigration out of the study
   area. The most likely cause of this decline in the Barnegat Bay
   population is frequent flooding due to sea level rise and severe storms.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean Gulls (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus) are a relatively new
   breeding species in western and central Europe. They are characterized
   by sexual monomorphism in plumage, which precludes easy sex
   identification in this species. To assess the degree of sexual
   dimorphism in body size and verify whether morphometric traits may be
   used to reliably sex individuals of this species, the measurements of
   six traits (wing, head, bill and tarsus length; bill depth at gonys; and
   bill depth at the base) were taken from individuals breeding at several
   sites located across Poland. Mediterranean Gulls were sexed molecularly
   by amplification of CHD-linked (chromodomain helicase DNA binding
   protein gene) sequences from W and Z chromosomes. The repeatability of
   measurements for different traits was high or very high except for bill
   depth at the base when measured by different observers. Males were
   larger than females in all traits, but distributions of these traits
   substantially overlapped. A discriminant function analysis selected
   three traits (head length, bill depth at the gonys and tarsus length)
   that classified the sex of individuals with 100\% accuracy. It is
   suggested that the derived discriminant function may be successfully
   applied to sex Mediterranean Gulls from different breeding populations
   in central Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The role of rice fields as feeding habitats for the two main waterfowl
   herbivores, Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra) and Mallard (Ands
   platyrhynchos), in the Ebro Delta, a Mediterranean wetland in
   northeastern Spain, was investigated. Exclusion cages and tethering
   experiments were deployed within a rice field at the beginning of the
   growing season (summer 2010) and before harvest (autumn 2010). In
   summer, waterfowl abundances were low, but cage experiments detected
   rice field damage by waterfowl grazing through a significant reduction
   in plant biomass (although consumption was undetectable using tethers).
   In autumn, waterfowl abundance increased and tethering experiments
   detected consumption of rice plants with developed seeds, whereas cage
   experiments did not show grazing effects. Gut content analyses indicate
   that Mallards are mainly granivorous, feeding mostly on seeds of spiral
   ditch grass (Ruppia cirrhosa) and rice (Oryza sativa), while Eurasian
   Coots are herbivorous, feeding mainly on macrophyte leaves. However,
   stable isotope analyses and mixing model results showed that in the long
   term both species seem to acquire most of their dietary needs from rice
   plants and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus). Dietary analyses
   confirm the importance of rice in both species' diets but also suggest
   that waterfowl may undergo seasonal dietary variations. These are mostly
   influenced by changes in the availability of food resources in the area
   rather than by their nutritional quality. This study confirms the
   ecological importance of rice fields as a complementary feeding habitat
   for waterfowl during the growing season in Mediterranean areas. It also
   highlights the importance of including these habitats in wetland
   management for waterfowl conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Nearshore waters provide very important habitat for sea ducks (Tribe
   Mergini) during migration and winter, but gathering information on sea
   duck use of shallow nearshore waters is challenging because traditional
   aerial and boat-based surveys are expensive, are usually conducted
   infrequently, and are often not feasible near the coast. The objective
   of this study was to use land-based surveys to characterize
   spatiotemporal variation in the abundance and behavior (e.g., foraging,
   flying) of Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) and scoters (Melanitta
   spp.) in nearshore waters of southern New England. Surveys (60-120 min
   per survey, n = 1,044 surveys) were conducted throughout the day from
   February 2009 to July 2010 to assess diurnal and seasonal variation in
   sea duck behavior and spatial distribution at nine sites in southern
   Rhode Island. The density of sea ducks resting or foraging on the water
   exhibited little diurnal variation, whereas flight activity dramatically
   increased nearer to sunrise. Sea duck densities and passage rates
   (individuals/km(2)/hr) peaked during migration periods from October
   through November and February through April, although there were
   important seasonal differences between sites. For example, the highest
   densities of Common Eider during fall were in a protected estuary,
   whereas abundance of scoters during fall was greater at a coastal
   headland. The relative activity of Common Eider on the water and in
   flight was similar among sites, whereas scoters exhibited highly
   variable activity among sites, particularly during winter and spring.
   The spatiotemporal patterns in abundance and behavior of sea ducks in
   nearshore waters that we detected using land-based surveys provides
   essential, complementary information to that available from other types
   of waterfowl and seabird surveys in southern New England.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of suitable breeding habitats is an important factor in
   explaining seabird demographic fluctuations. For ground nesting
   seabirds, such as Little Terns (Sternula albifrons), an essential
   characteristic in determining suitability of breeding habitats is
   vegetative cover. This study evaluated whether the long-term
   fluctuations (1979-2014) in Little Tern breeding numbers on sandy beach
   colonies of Ria Formosa, Algarve, Portugal, could be explained by
   changes in vegetation cover at each sandy beach colony, environmental
   variability (measured by the climatic North Atlantic Oscillation index),
   or a combination of both. The percentage of vegetation cover for each
   sandy beach was calculated from aerial photos of Ria Formosa barrier
   islands from 1976 to 2012, and related to breeding census data from the
   same period. The climatic variation measured by the North Atlantic
   Oscillation index did notshow a significant relationship with the number
   of breeding pairs nesting on each sandy beach colony. A segmented
   regression model constructed to model the effect of vegetation cover on
   the number of breeding pairs on sandy beaches found an optimal
   vegetation cover of around 10\% and an overall breakpoint of
   42\%vegetation cover; the model predicted that only similar to 4\% of
   breeding pairs would endure with 90\% vegetation cover and none would
   endure with 92\% vegetation cover. Little Terns in Ria Formosa appear to
   adopt a fugitive strategy, moving their colonies to locations with
   better breeding conditions in response to the overgrowth of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaculture can provide important surrogate habitats for waterbirds. In
   response to the 2010 Deep-water Horizon oil spill, the National Resource
   Conservation Service enacted the Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative
   through which incentivized landowners provided wetland habitats for
   migrating waterbirds. Diversity and abundance of waterbirds in six
   production and four idled aquaculture facilities in the Mississippi
   Alluvial Valley were estimated during the winters of 2011-2013.
   Wintering waterbirds exhibited similar densities on production (i.e.,
   similar to 22 birds/ha) and idled (i.e., similar to 20 birds/ha) sites.
   A total of 42 species were found using both types of aquaculture
   wetlands combined, but there was considerable departure in bird guilds
   occupying the two wetland types. The primary users of production ponds
   were diving and dabbling ducks and American coots. However, idled ponds,
   with varying water depths (e.g., mudflats to 20 cm) and diverse emergent
   vegetation-water interspersion, attracted over 30 species of waterbirds
   and, on average, had more species of waterbirds from fall through early
   spring than catfish production ponds. Conservation through the Migratory
   Bird Habitat Initiative was likely responsible for this difference. Our
   results suggest production and idled Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative
   aquaculture impoundments produced suitable conditions for various
   waterbird species and highlight the importance of conservation programs
   on private lands that promote diversity in vegetation structure and
   water depths to enhance waterbird diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific brood parasitism occurs when the eggs of one species are
   laid in the nest of a different species, but evidence of this phenomenon
   is scarce. Facultative interspecific brood parasitism has been described
   in Charadriiformes. However, to our knowledge, our study provides the
   first documentation of facultative interspecific brood parasitism in the
   colonially breeding species we studied. The factors affecting its
   frequency in relation to colony species composition, nest density, and
   period of the breeding season was analyzed. Between 2006 and 2012, we
   monitored 2,493 nests of five species: Northern Lapwing (Vanellus
   vanellus; n = 745), Common Redshank (Tringa totanus; n = 467),
   Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa; n = 237), Black-headed Gull
   (Chroicocephalus ridibundus-, n = 932) and Common Tern (Sterna hirundo;
   n = 112). Facultative interspecific brood parasitism was observed in
   1.3\% of all nests. Typically, a single egg was laid in a host nest
   (59.4\% of parasitized nests), and a maximum of four parasitic eggs were
   laid (3.1\% of parasitized nests). The Common Redshank showed the
   highest frequency of facultative interspecific brood parasitism
   (59.4\%), followed by Northern Lapwing (28.1\%). Facultative
   interspecific brood parasitism occurred most frequently at the beginning
   of the breeding season (62.5\% between the end of April and 10 May),
   although the number of active nests peaked later than did the number of
   parasitized nests. Hatching success of broods containing parasitic eggs
   was 17.8\%, which was lower than that of non-parasitized nests (23.1\%).
   Interspecific brood parasitism may evolve from conspecific brood
   parasitism in colonies with high nest densities. Low, but constant
   frequencies of facultative interspecific brood parasitism may suggest
   either that this is a strategy to increase fecundity or non-adaptive
   behavior derived from failures to identify the nest due to the high nest
   density in the colony.}},

Abstract = {{A method for trapping both parents of Whiskered Terns (Chlidonias
   hybrida), a semi-precocial species, using enclosures that allow access
   to the chicks until they fledge is described. The approach combines the
   gradual installation of enclosures with their subsequent, temporary
   conversion into traps used to capture adult birds. The success rate for
   trapping both mates on the target nests (n = 83) was 77\%. Nest
   desertions after the erection of the enclosure and after trapping were
   1\% and 3\%, respectively. A high effectiveness of trapping both parents
   and a low percentage of losses can be achieved with the gradual
   installation of the enclosure and the birds' habituation to it. This
   trapping technique is safe and efficient, enabling researchers to
   collect samples from all family members with ease.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding biology in grebes (Podicipedidae) is less understood than that
   of other waterbirds in Australia. This paper reports on a study of
   breeding Australasian Grebes (Tachybaptus novaehollandiae) on five urban
   wetlands in Sydney, New South Wales, from 2001 to 2011. During the 10
   years of the study, breeding pairs only used the two main study sites
   (Lime Kiln Bay Wetland and Moore Reserve Wetland) in 20\% and 30\% of
   the breeding seasons, respectively. Two nests and two nest building
   attempts from one site and one pair during the 2010-2011 breeding season
   are described, while the development and survival of 23 chicks (n = 5
   broods) during the 10 years are also described. The proportion of chicks
   surviving to adult plumage was 39\%. Brood rivalry and parental
   favoritism were observed. Chicks were capable of some independent
   behavior (e.g., preening and short dives) within 1 week of hatching;
   chicks not favored by their parents were forced to accelerate their
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) are globally Vulnerable due to
   the decline of the population and to a decline in the number of breeding
   sites in comparison to historical records. In 2010, we observed a few
   thousand Humboldt Penguins nesting in a surface-nest colony on Isla
   Santa Rosa in southern Peril. This number was unexpected because this
   site has never been listed as an important Humboldt Penguin breeding
   ground. We visited this island again in June 2011 and 2012, and counted
   1,965 and 1,745 active nests, respectively. These numbers indicate not
   only the presence of at least 3,500-4,000 Humboldt Penguins, but places
   Isla Santa Rosa among the five largest Humboldt Penguin colonies within
   its entire range. The need for recognition of Isla Santa Rosa as a major
   Humboldt Penguin refuge is crucial for the conservation of the species,
   as the island has remained untouched from guano harvesting since 1996.
   This has resulted in a significant accumulation of guano likely to be
   legally collected in the next few years. Unsupervised guano harvesting
   could cause a Humboldt Penguin exodus and jeopardize the existence of
   this colony. Under this scenario, it is recommended that Isla Santa Rosa
   be closed to guano harvesting until a surveillance program to protect
   the Humboldt Penguins can be established and proven to work under the
   conditions found on Isla Santa Rosa.}},

   Adult males (n = 17) were significantly larger than adult females (n =
   19) in all parameters, and hatch-year Reddish Egrets were significantly
   smaller than adults in all parameters. Additionally, considerably larger
   measurements were recorded on average than those previously available
   for Reddish Egrets. These measurements provide updated information on
   the morphometry of Reddish Egrets that will be useful in understanding
   life history strategies and for planning future studies.}},

   National Wildlife Refuge in Ottawa and Lucas Counties, Ohio, USA, from
   2004 to 2009. Virginia Rails and Soras were documented arriving in
   northern Ohio earlier than previous research, but not older anecdotal
   records King Rails were within the bounds of all previous records. Using
   traps with playback may have allowed us to detect these species at

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{The Rufous-throated Dipper (Cinclus schulzi) is an endemic and
   threatened bird that inhabits the mountain rivers of southern Yungas of
   Argentina and Bolivia. This is the rarest and least known species of the
   genus, in part because of its restricted distribution. The aim of this
   study was to describe the nests and nest sites of the Rufous-throated
   Dipper in mountain rivers of northwestern Argentina. Five rivers were
   surveyed in transects of 3 to 6 km long from 2010 to 2013. The shape,
   size, substrate and building material of nests and nest and non-nest
   characteristics were assessed and compared in plots of 2 by 2 m. Plots
   with nests were compared to non-nesting plots for a number of habitat
   characteristics. Most nests found (78.57\%; n = 28) had a globular
   shape, were attached to rocky substrates and were built using moss. The
   height of nests above the water level (P = 0.02), slope (P= 0.03) and
   watercourse width (P <0.01) varied among rivers. Plots at nest sites had
   significantly higher values of some habitat characteristics than
   non-nesting plots, including emergent rocks (P < 0.01), slope (P< 0.02),
   greater number of rapids (P< 0.01), number of pools (P< 0.01), water
   velocity (P< 0.05), and river depth (P < 0.01), but had narrower
   watercourse width (P < 0.01). Previously, the understanding of the
   breeding ecology of the Rufous-throated Dipper was based only on
   anecdotal evidence. Understanding the breeding habitat requirements is a
   prerequisite for the development of a conservation action plan for this
   threatened species.}},

   to migratory species. Determining how and when different subpopuladons
   intermingle during different phases of the annual cycle can help
   identify important geographical regions or features as targets for
   conservation efforts and can help inform our understanding of
   continental-scale disease transmission. In this study, stable isotopes
   of hydrogen and carbon in contour feathers were used to assess the
   degree of molt-site fidelity among Bar-headed Geese (Anser indicus)
   captured in north-central Mongolia. Samples were collected from actively
   molting Bar-headed Geese (n = 61), and some individual samples included
   both a newly grown feather (still in sheath) and an old, worn feather
   from the bird's previous molt (n = 21). Although there was no difference
   in mean hydrogen isotope ratios for the old and new feathers, the
   isotopic variance in old feathers was approximately three times higher
   than that of the new feathers, which suggests that these birds use
   different and geographically distant molting locations from year to
   year. To further test this conclusion, online data and modeling tools
   from the isoMAP website were used to generate probability landscapes for
   the origin of eachfeather. Likely molting locations were much more
   widespread for old feathers than for new feathers, which supports the
   prospect of low molt-site fidelity. This finding indicates that
   population connectivity would be greater than expected based on data
   from a single annual cycle, and that disease spread can be rapid even in
   areas like Mongolia where Bar-headed Geese generally breed in small
   isolated groups.}},

Abstract = {{Nest depredation is the leading cause of waterfowl nest failures in much
   of the Prairie Pothole Region, USA. In 2006 and 2007, spatial and
   temporal patterns of nest depredation were evaluated on 248 waterfowl
   nests and 88 simulated waterfowl nests in North Dakota, USA. The
   hypothesis that predators are able to locate adjacent nests using an
   area-restricted search once they find the first nest and that ducks will
   space their nests apart to reduce this from happening was tested.
   However, no evidence was found to support either part of this hypothesis
   or that density-dependent depredation was occurring. This lack of
   support, along with no relationship between nest density and nest
   success, indicate that density-dependent depredation may not have been a
   problem in our study area. Artificial nests were used to test the
   hypothesis that meteorological conditions impact nest depredation rates.
   Artificial nests were more likely to be depredated when either
   temperature or dew point was high. It was hypothesized that these
   meteorological conditions increase the evaporation rate of odorants, and
   thereby improve the ability of predators to locate food sources by using
   olfaction. These meteorological conditions could also increase odor
   release from the surfaces of nests or incubating hens, although
   additional studies are necessary to determine if the relationship
   between evaporation rates and foraging efficiency of olfactory predators
   holds for natural waterfowl nests.}},

Abstract = {{Sympatric nesting seabird species are often found to differ in one or
   more aspects of their foraging ecology. This is usually interpreted as
   resource partitioning, potentially due to current or past competition,
   but other explanations have been proposed. Three closely related species
   of alcids breeding together in subarctic southwest Greenland differed in
   several aspects of their foraging ecology during chick rearing.
   Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) and Common Murres (U. aalge) did not
   differ in their diving behavior but both species differed markedly with
   Razorbills (Alca torda). Thick-billed Murres foraged mainly close to the
   colony, whereas Common Murres and Razorbills also made foraging trips to
   the mainland coast. Common Murres made significantly more bouts (series
   of dives) per trip than Thick-billed Murres, but significantly fewer
   dives per bout than Razorbills. Median dive depth of Thick-billed and
   Common murres was twice that of Razorbills. Thick-billed Murres nested
   on open ledges and spent most of their non-foraging time on the ledge
   attending the chick. Common Murres and Razorbills nested under boulders
   and in crevices and often left their chicks alone (particularly at
   night) and rested on the water. One interpretation of this pattern is
   that the risk of predation from Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus) was
   much higher on open ledges, and that Thick-billed Murres therefore had
   to guard their chicks at all times.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of hematological and biochemical parameters provides
   important data to assess the physiological condition in wild birds.
   Therefore, to carry out ecophysiology or conservation studies it is
   essential to establish baseline physiological parameters and how these
   change with age and life history events. Hematological (hematocrit,
   hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation) and biochemical (glucose,
   total lipids and proteins, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase
   activities and electrolyte concentration) reference values were
   determined in two Antarctic migratory bird species, the Brown Skua
   (Stercorarius antarcticus) and Stinth Polar Skua (S. maccormickz), from
   South Shetland Island during breeding season. Also, hematological data
   (hematocrit) were determined for non-Antarctic skuas, with Chilean (S.
   chilensis) and Falkland (S. antarcticas antarcticus) skuas sampled in
   the Beagle Channel islands (Tierra del Fuego Province) and Viana Island
   (Chubut Province),Argentina, respectively. Differences between adult
   Antarctic skua species were observed in hemoglobin, erythrocyte
   sedimentation, total lipids and aspartate aminotransferase activity. In
   addition, age-related differences in Antarctic skuas in hematocrit,
   hemoglobin, glucose and total protein values were observed. Serum
   reference protein fractions (Albumin, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta and gamma
   globulins) were assessed by electrophoresis for Antarctic and
   non-Antarctic skuas. Similar protein patterns were observed between
   South Polar and Chilean skuas as well between Falkland Skua and Brown
   Skua. The differences between adult sympatric Antarctic skuas may be
   related to their nutritional status and species-specific migrations,
   feeding habits and the differential use of the breeding niches, while
   the age variation may be related to physiological development processes
   in chicks or to the energy expenditure in adults during breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding season is a demanding period in an individual's annual
   cycle because it must balance energy gains with the competing demands of
   reproduction and self-maintenance and properly allocate time and energy
   to both. To better understand how this balance is reached,
   nest-attendance patterns, food-provisioning rates, and foraging patterns
   were studied in radio-tagged Great Egrets (Ardea alba) breeding in a
   mixed-species colony in Wichita, Kansas, from May-August 2010-2013. A
   total 900 bird-days for 16 Great Egrets (60 +/- 32 days/ bird) provided
   777 records of feeding sites, yielding travel times, flight velocities,
   and flight distances. Prey-capture rates, capture efficiencies, prey
   sizes and aggressive interactions were recorded at rivers, ponds, and
   weirs. A data logger placed in the colony from 2011-2013 recorded 3,390
   arrivals and departures by 14 Great Egrets, documenting nest-attendance
   patterns. Provisioning intervals (196 +/- 18 min {[}SD]; Range =
   30-2,044 min) differed among radio-tagged individuals and among the
   three years. Round-trip distances to feeding sites in 2011 (16.3 +/-
   17.8 km) and 2012 (16.0 +/- 7.0 km) were both were longer than in 2013
   (11.1 +/- 3.3 km). Might distances to feeding sites also differed among
   individuals and increased with breeding stage. Strike rates
   (strikes/min) and capture rates (prey/ min) differed by year but not by
   microhabitat. However, capture efficiency (successful strikes/total
   strikes) differed among microhabitats. Fish captured at weirs averaged
   six times heavier than those caught at rivers or ponds, but Great Egrets
   also encountered rates of aggression at weirs five to 10 times higher
   than at the other sites. A summary of energy gains and expenditures by
   radio-tagged Great Egrets is described, and differences among individual
   birds, among years, and across microhabitats is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Over the course of a year, rice fields display spatial and temporal

   the spatial and temporal differences produced by rice field farming
   management practices on waterbird species during a year. The present
   study investigated spatial and temporal patterns of species distribution
   and examined the factors that affect waterbird selection of foraging
   habitats in the rice fields located in the midwestern part of South
   Korea from April 2009 to March 2010 and from April 2011 to March 2012.
   Waterbird species represented strong seasonality and selectively used
   different field types at a fine spatial scale. The selection of field
   type depended more on field structures that were related to the
   vulnerability of prey items than on prey abundance in rice fields. Water
   level was an important factor that affected shorebird selection of
   foraging habitat, and they chose habitats with different water levels
   according to their body size. The density of rice plants was a critical
   factor affecting the selection of habitats by herons, because densely
   planted fields inhibited their access to food. The presence of rolled
   straw in rice fields affected the distribution of waterfowl. These
   results demonstrate that farming management practices, which determine
   prey accessibility, strongly affect the use of rice field habitats by
   waterbirds. Our knowledge of these relationships should be incorporated
   into conservation practices protecting the various waterbird species
   that use rice fields.}},

Abstract = {{The Spectacled Guillemot (Cepphus carbo) is a seabird endemic to
   northeastern Asia. It is listed as a ``Vulnerable{''} species in Japan,
   though little is known of its population status. Population surveys were
   carried out during 2011-2014 throughout their range in northern Japan.
   Twenty-eight known and six suspected breeding colonies were reported in
   this region during 1875-2010. Fourteen known and four suspected breeding
   colonies were found in the 2011-2014 surveys, with 1,169 individuals and
   294 nests. Based on our analysis of the two survey periods, 19 colonies
   have apparently disappeared, and populations have decreased in 12 of the
   current colonies. Our models indicated that colonies with small numbers
   of individuals were most likely to disappear, whereas other
   environmental factors (i.e., colony type, latitude, and SST trends) had
   relatively minimal effects on local colony extirpation. Our study shows
   that the population status of the Spectacled Guillemot has deteriorated
   in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to describe the size dimorphism in adult
   Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra). Appropriate discriminant functions to
   allow efficient sex determination on the basis of morphological
   measurements were developed. Breeding Eurasian Coots (n = 55) were
   captured from the urban population in central Poland. Eight measurements
   were collected from each individual, and all individuals were
   molecularly sexed. Head length and wing length yielded the highest
   discriminatory power among the collected measurements, with males larger
   than females. Using a jackknife procedure, a combination of these two
   measurements correctly sexed approximately 95\% of Eurasian Coot
   individuals. The discriminant functions developed here could be a
   reliable alternative to molecular sexing techniques in the Eurasian
   Coot.}},

Abstract = {{Molt and migration can coincide in Arctic nesting waterfowl because they
   have little time between fledging and the severe weather that
   precipitates migration. Objectives were to observe how patterns in
   autumn and winter molt by Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) were
   influenced by nutrient reserves or seasonal life-cycle events. Molt
   scores and nutrient reserves were determined for birds salvaged during
   autumn 2011 (n = 79) and collected during winter 2002-2004 (n = 255).
   Differences in molt among sex-age classes and correlation between molt
   and nutrient reserves were determined. It was predicted that adult
   females and juveniles of both sexes suspended molt during autumn
   migration to limit energetic overlap; however, greater molt in juveniles
   during autumn than winter was detected. Correlation between molt and
   nutrient reserves were not detected. Molt was less in adult males than
   females and juveniles during winter, which may suggest that the effects
   of reproduction (females) and growth (juveniles) extended their molt
   into winter. Observed molt patterns are consistent with fixed cues
   associated with the timing of seasonal life-cycle events of this
   species. This could have important implications in understanding the
   life-cycle events of Long-tailed Ducks and provide novel explanations of
   seasonal molt.}},

Abstract = {{Recent dramatic growth of the North American Interior population of
   Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) has led to concern
   about potential impacts of this species on co-nesting colonial
   waterbirds. Previous investigations of these concerns have focused on
   Double-crested Cormorant interactions with other species within
   homogeneous breeding environments, making broad patterns difficult to
   identify. The present study examined how nest location, nest density,
   and species identity mediate agonistic interactions among Double-crested
   Cormorants and Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) nesting at a colony
   site in central Minnesota, USA. Twenty-six Double-crested Cormorant
   nests and 27 Great Blue Heron nests were observed for 30 min weekly for
   8 weeks during the breeding season to estimate frequency of agonistic
   behavior and identify species-level patterns of interaction. Most
   agonistic interactions observed (81\%) were intraspecific interactions
   among Double-crested Cormorants; Great Blue Herons engaged in a higher
   combined total count of interspecific and intraspecific interactions
   when they nested near Double-crested Cormorants. Interspecific
   interactions were more common among ground-nesting birds than among
   tree-nesting birds. This study suggests that further investigation into
   impacts of Double-crested Cormorants on co-nesting birds is most
   warranted for ground-nesting colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Nest success and nest-site characteristics of the Tufted Duck (Aythya
   fuligula) were studied during the 1996 breeding season at Loch Leven,
   Scotland. Approximately 463 47 Tufted Duck pairs nested in association
   with 6,674 805 Black-headed Gull pairs (Larus ridibundus) on St. Serfs
   Island. Tufted Ducks had an apparent nest success rate of 79.5\% (Range:
   65.8\%-83.6\%; n = 73). Multiple logistic regression was used to test
   the hypothesis that nest-site characteristics, such as distance to
   colony edge, overhead and vertical nest cover and distance to nearest
   Tufted Duck or Black-headed Gull nest, affect nest success. By using
   only the Tufted Duck nests with a known fate (n = 60), distance to the
   colony edge was identified as the primary predictor of nest success (P =
   0.004), with successful nests (31.60 +/- 1.71 m) located farther from
   the colony edge than those that failed (18.75 +/- 2.61 m). Results
   support the central-periphery nest distribution model which suggests
   that nests located in the center of a colony, particularly in
   homogeneous habitats, are less accessible to predators and have greater
   reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Shoebills (Balaeniceps rex) breed in central-eastern Africa with a world
   population of only 5,000-8,000 individuals. To provide protection to
   this threatened species, conservationists need a better understanding
   about Shoebill foraging and breeding ecology, their habitat use and
   their distribution. For this study, nest attendance and prey
   provisioning were recorded with nest cameras for Shoebills in the
   Bangweulu Wetlands in Zambia in 2012 and 2013. Chick growth and breeding
   success were monitored at the same time. Parental attendance was
   constant in the first 40 days of chick rearing, with attending parents
   only leaving the nest briefly to collect water for cooling the chicks or
   to collect material to maintain the nest. Attendance decreased as chicks
   aged, but prey provisioning remained constant throughout the nestling
   stage at 1.2 deliveries per day. Feeding peaked during the early and
   late morning. Chick growth rates were as expected given the size of the
   species, and chicks reached a fledging mass of approximately 5.7 kg.
   During 2011, breeding success was particularly low (20\%, n = 10 nests)
   due to high levels of human disturbance, with chicks being removed from
   nests. Parents fledged 0.89 chicks per nest (n = 11 nests) when nests
   were actively protected from human disturbance and theft in 2012-2013.
   These findings could be useful for formulating guidelines for
   sustainable tourism to minimize disturbance and optimize breeding
   success in Shoebill populations.}},

Abstract = {{Least (Calidris minutilla, n = 110) and Western (Calidris mauri, n = 37)
   sandpipers collected in Cuban wetlands were sexed by gonadal examination
   on dissection and used to assess the robustness of two morphometric
   methods commonly used to assign sex in shorebirds. Discriminant function
   analyses were performed and then tested by jackknife validation. The
   best discriminant function for Least Sandpiper included culmen and wing
   lengths and correctly classified 91\% of the birds. Using culmen length,
   the discriminant function correctly sexed 97\% of the Western Sandpiper.
   Sex ratio and morphometric estimates obtained through sexing Least and
   Western sandpipers by discriminant functions were not significantly
   different from the population sexed by gonadal examination on
   dissection. The range of the bill lengths used for sex determination of
   Least and Western sandpipers were then assessed by fitting the known-sex
   data. Classification accuracy of the bill length method was high for
   Western Sandpiper (95\%), but was imprecise (44\%) and female biased for
   Least Sandpiper. Consequently, a female biased sex ratio and
   under-estimation of male culmen length occurred for Least, but not
   Western, sandpipers classified by the bill length method. The findings
   suggest that sex determination based on the single measurement of culmen
   length is only accurate for Western Sandpiper, a species with high
   sexual size dimorphism. Linear measurements are also important for sex
   assignment in Least Sandpiper, but only using a discriminant function
   analysis approach.}},

Abstract = {{The Changtang Plateau is located in the northern part of Tibet in
   western China, with the most numerous, high altitude lake complexes in
   the world. High altitude lakes (n = 48) were visited from July to
   August, 2008, to investigate the summer abundance and distribution of
   waterbirds. A total of 43,143 individuals of 49 waterbird species were
   recorded during our survey. Among them, the most abundant were
   Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus), followed by Brown-headed Gull (Larus
   brunnicephalus), Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and Great
   Black-headed Gull (L. ichthyaetus). These four species comprised 81.2\%
   of all the waterbirds counted. A total of 12,796 Bar-headed Geese were
   counted at 39 lakes and comprised 29.6\% of total birds counted. The
   lakes with greatest number of individuals were Dong, Rebang, Kunzhong,
   Yaduo, and Yueqia; the lakes with greatest species richness were
   Bangong, Dangreyong, Aiyong, Yaduo, and Zharinanmu, while the lakes with
   greatest bird species diversity were Dangreyong, Bangong, Kunzhong, and
   Aiyong. In addition, a total of 514 Black-necked Cranes (Grus
   nigricollis) were counted at 39 lakes, including 326 individuals in
   Nagqu Prefecture and 188 in Aili Prefecture. There were significant
   differences between the waterbird species, among the different
   salinities of the lakes and with the area of the lakes. The principal
   long-term threat to lakes in the Changtang region is wetland
   degradation, primarily from mineral exploitation.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{The influence of both environmental conditions and social cues on the
   distance flown to foraging sites was examined for breeding Wood Storks
   (Mycteria americana) in the Florida Everglades, USA. Adult Wood Storks
   (n = 73) were followed in a small plane from their nesting colony to
   their foraging locations during the time when adult Wood Storks were
   incubating and feeding chicks. On average, foraging sites were close to
   the nesting colony (mean = 9.6 km +/- 1.1), and in shallow water (mean =
   9.9 cm +/- 0.7) that was receding at a moderate rate (-0.36 cm/day +/-
   0.13). Wood Storks landed at foraging sites already occupied by other
   white wading birds 99\% of the time, with a mean flock size of 64 +/- 14
   birds. Model selection identified flock size and water recession rate as
   the most important variables that influenced Wood Stork foraging flight
   distances. Distances flown to foraging sites increased with increasing
   flock sizes and decreased with increasing recession rates (increasing by
   39\% and decreasing by 18\% across the observed range of data,
   respectively) while accounting for colony location and water depths.
   These findings are particularly important because they demonstrate that
   both social and environmental factors play critical roles in the
   foraging site selection process Wood Storks use during the breeding
   season. Further, these results in part can be linked to management
   activities because at least in the case of water recession rates,
   managers can actively influence recession rates across much of the
   Everglades landscape.}},

Title = {{Day and Night Habitat Associations of Wintering Dunlin (Calidris alpina)
   within an Agriculture-Wetland Mosaic}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Darkness comprises more than half of each 24-hr cycle during winter in
   California's Sacramento Valley, but no studies have assessed nocturnal
   habitat use by wintering shorebirds at this inland site. From February
   to May 2013, the day and night habitat associations of radio-tagged
   Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were compared between post-harvest flooded rice
   fields and managed freshwater wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Dunlin
   had decreasing associations with rice during both day and night from
   February to April. Dunlin exclusively used rice at night until 25 March,
   when they shifted to wetlands. During the day, Dunlin were regularly
   associated with both rice and wetlands until 4 March, and they
   exclusively used wetlands beginning 25 March. Diel movements by
   individual Dunlin revealed that birds using rice during the day also
   used rice during the subsequent night. Our findings suggest that flooded
   rice, when available, may be more suitable as nocturnal habitat than
   managed wetlands, and the removal of water from rice fields in February
   and March causes Dunlin to either use wetlands exclusively or leave the
   area. Conservation of Dunlin, and likely other migratory shorebirds, may
   be enhanced by managing the agriculture-wetland mosaic in the Sacramento
   Valley to ensure that an adequate amount of shallow-water habitats
   remain during March and April, prior to spring migration.}},

Abstract = {{The global decline in natural wetland cover has enhanced the importance
   of artificial wetlands, such as rice fields, as waterbird habitats. In
   this study, relationships of waterbird assemblages, in terms of
   abundance, diversity and spatial distribution to their invertebrate
   prey, were investigated across rice paddy fields at various growth
   stages in western Kenya. Waterbirds were first grouped as large or small
   waders and prey items as aquatic or non-aquatic. Waterbird assemblage
   patterns were then tested against prey abundance across three rice
   growth stages. Overall, waterbirds were most abundant in the middle
   stages of rice growth (F-2,F-732 = 3.304, P = 0.041). The most common
   large waterbirds were in the Ardeidae and Threskiornithidae families,
   while the most common and abundant small waterbirds were in the
   Charadriidae and Scolopacidae families. Most small waterbirds were
   present in the early rice growth stages, while most large waterbirds
   were present in the middle stages of rice growth. Species diversity
   differed significantly by rice growth stage among the large but not the
   small waterbirds (F-2,F-52 = 4.505, P = 0.025). Abundance of small
   waterbirds was affected more by diversity than by abundance of their
   prey (R = 0.771, P = 0.034), suggesting a selective feeding strategy
   that may be driven by frequent mobility or density-dependent dispersal
   pressures during flooded-field phases. Conversely, large waterbirds were
   more abundant in more prey-dense areas regardless of prey diversity (R =
   0.886, P = 0.024), reflecting a more opportunistic feeding strategy,
   exploiting both flooded and dry field stages. This strategy explained
   the wider spatial distribution of large waterbirds. Because of their
   wide selection of prey type, large waterbirds potentially play a greater
   role in controlling ground-level rice pests across all rice growth
   stages. Field management options that favor presence of large waterbirds
   may enhance this ecological role of natural rice pest control.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced nest survival has been suggested as a primary cause for the
   decline of Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus) populations. The fates of
   Snowy Plover nests (n = 589) were determined from five locations at the
   Great Salt Lake in Utah during the 2003, 2005-2010 and 2012 breeding
   seasons. A five-stage hierarchical modeling procedure was used, and five
   competing models (Delta AIC(c) < 2) that best described variation in
   nest survival were identified. These competing models included the
   influences of study site and year with a quadratic time trend and
   covariates quantifying nest age, temperature, precipitation, distance to
   water control structures (dikes), and nesting substrate (barren mudflat,
   vegetation patches, or conspicuous objects). Among unsuccessful nests
   (45.6\%; n = 277), the most common cause of failure was predation
   (72.9\%), followed by weather and abandonment (10.5\% and 10.1\%,
   respectively). Daily nest survival rates ranged from 0.89 to 0.97 and
   varied annually and across sites. Nests located on barren flats had
   lower daily nest survival than those located in vegetated patches or
   near conspicuous objects. Proximity to dikes influenced nest survival as
   nests within 100 m had lower daily survival rates than nests further
   than 100 m from dikes. The population of Snowy Plovers on the Great Salt
   Lake contributes substantially to an overall imperiled North American
   population. Managers should consider measures to reduce the
   attractiveness of dikes as nesting habitat to increase nest survival
   rates for Snowy Plover.}},

Abstract = {{Shorebird assemblage composition and habitat-use patterns were
   characterized at Punta Rasa during the austral summer, autumn and
   winter. Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high
   species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a
   relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were
   driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as
   feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine
   environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns
   and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total
   abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total
   abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the
   assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American
   Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica)
   and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition,
   Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher
   (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red
   Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn
   assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during
   this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a
   subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During
   the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage.
   However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant
   species remained in the area. In the case of the endangered Red Knot,
   Punta Rasa is, along with Lagoa do Peixe in Brazil, one of the sites in
   South America with the highest known abundances during the austral
   winter.}},

Abstract = {{Predicted sea-level rise and increases in the frequency and magnitude of
   storm surges are potential threats to waterbird nests and associated
   breeding habitat on low-lying landforms, such as barrier islands.
   Sea-level rise in Northumberland Strait of eastern Canada, predicted to
   rise by at least 0.50-0.60 m by 2100, could permanently flood large
   tracts of barrier island habitat. Potential impacts of higher sea levels
   on breeding habitat of Red-breasted Mergansers (Mergus serrator) were
   studied on three barrier islands at Kouchibouguac National Park, New
   Brunswick, Canada. Objectives of the study were to: 1) identify the
   range of dates for which nests (n = 189) were active and thus vulnerable
   to flooding; 2) determine elevation and distance to water for each nest;
   3) examine whether birds selected nest sites that were relatively
   elevated and far from water; and 4) estimate the proportion of nests
   that could be flooded under four plausible sea-level rise and storm
   surge scenarios. Peak nesting occurred during mid-June to mid-July.
   Red-breasted Mergansers generally sought elevated regions with beach
   grasses for nest placement. Nearly 50\% of nests were < 2 m above mean
   sea level. Nest elevations were greater than a conservative estimate of
   sea-level rise of 0.60 m. However, = 50\% of these nests are predicted
   to be flooded during a high spring tide if sea levels are 0.60 m
   greater, and these impacts would be exacerbated when phased with a storm
   surge. A predicted surge of 2.55 m above mean sea level would inundate
   90\% of nests on the islands. Results indicate that predicted sea-level
   rise for Northumberland Strait over the next century threatens the
   habitat and survival of waterbird nests on barrier islands, particularly
   if there is little accretion to the islands during this period.
   Accordingly, rates of sediment accretion or erosion on the Tern Islands
   should be monitored closely as sea levels continue to rise.}},

Abstract = {{Information on Nearctic shorebirds is scarce for inland South America.
   This work presents information on abundance and habitat use of the
   species that inhabit water bodies in the highlands of western Santa Cruz
   province, Argentina. Surveys were conducted during four austral summers
   ( January to March) from 2010 to 2013, with annual data collected at 378
   lakes. Results indicate that species distribution varies from year to
   year. The most abundant species was Baird's Sandpiper (Calidris
   bairdii). Habitat modeling showed that this species favors `depression'
   type lakes and that individuals do not distribute uniformly across the
   area, with higher yearly abundance at Strobel Plateau and the plateaus
   of the `Austral complex'. Size of the water body is positively related
   to abundance of White-rumped Sandpiper (C. fuscicollis) and Wilson's
   Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor). Results show that these highlands are
   sites of interest for the conservation of migratory shorebirds.}},

Abstract = {{Although several studies have reported basic information about the size
   of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) eggs, no attention has been paid to the
   comparison of patterns of intra-clutch variation at different breeding
   sites. Here, the variation in egg size of Kelp Gulls at two colonies
   from Patagonia, Argentina, was analyzed. The objectives were to
   characterize egg size variation in Kelp Gulls breeding at a recently
   established colony in Punta Loma that primarily relies on natural prey;
   and to evaluate if patterns of intra-clutch variation in that colony
   differ from those at Vernaci Sudoeste Island, a larger and
   well-established colony with access to supplementary food in the form of
   fishery waste. In two-egg clutches, first-eggs were larger than
   second-eggs. Neither average egg size nor intra-clutch patterns differed
   between study sites. Also, in two-egg clutches, egg size decreased as
   date of laying increased, probably due to younger birds laying smaller
   eggs later in the season. The pattern of intra-clutch variation in
   three-egg clutches differed between sites. Three-egg clutches at Vernaci
   Sudoeste Island presented similar sizes for first-and second-eggs and
   these were larger than third-eggs. This pattern contrasted with the
   steady decrease in relation to laying order that was observed at Punta
   Loma. Also, second-and third-eggs from Vernaci Sudoeste Island were
   larger than corresponding eggs from Punta Loma. Our data suggest that
   differences in egg size between colonies could be the consequence of
   enhanced food availability at Vernaci Sudoeste Island in the form of
   discards generated by trawl fisheries. Future studies to evaluate age of
   birds and inter-annual environmental stochasticity are needed to

Abstract = {{Western (Aechmophorus occidentalis) and Clark's (A. clarkii) grebes are
   long-lived, migratory water-birds that are sensitive to human-caused
   disturbance while nesting. Sampling the age distribution of post-hatch
   chicks provides a method for estimating the timing of nest initiation
   without causing disturbance to breeding colonies. The goals of this work
   were to describe trends in breeding productivity at two of the largest
   nesting colonies in northern California and illustrate how brood size
   can be used to evaluate nesting phenology in Aechmophorus grebes. No
   differences were found in brood size between species. Brood size
   decreased linearly as nest initiation date increased, showing no
   differences in the rate of decline among age classes of young. Within
   seasons, older broods were found to be significantly smaller than
   younger broods, suggesting that mortality was occurring after hatching
   thereby reducing the potential number of chicks recruited into the adult
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle) is a monomorphic seabird
   characterized by its muted plumage and bright red feet, which it
   prominently displays during courtship. Foot color and oxidative stress
   were analyzed in a Black Guillemot colony at the Bay of Fundy during the
   2006 and 2007 breeding seasons. While no relationship between red
   intensity of feet and carotenoids was uncovered, the level of plasma
   oxidative damage was negatively correlated with foot color.
   Additionally, red intensity of male feet was significantly correlated
   with the red intensity of their mates' feet, suggesting the possibility
   of assortative mating by foot color in this species. Further
   experimental work is necessary to determine whether foot color is used
   in this species as an honest signal to relay information on the ability
   of an individual to manage oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{The Galapagos archipelago is characterized by a high degree of endemism
   across many taxa, linked to the archipelago's oceanic origin and
   distance from other colonizing land masses. A population of 500 American
   Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) resides in Galapagos, which is thought
   to share an historical origin with the American Flamingo currently found
   in the Caribbean region. Genetic and phenotypic parameters in American
   Flamingos from Galapagos and from the Caribbean were investigated.
   Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers data showed that the
   American Flamingo population in Galapagos differs genetically from that
   in the Caribbean. American Flamingos in Galapagos form a clade that
   differs by a single common nucleotide substitution from American
   Flamingos in the Caribbean. The genetic differentiation is also evident
   from nuclear DNA in that microsatellite data reveal a number of private
   alleles for the American Flamingo in Galapagos. Analysis of skeletal
   measurements showed that American Flamingos in Galapagos are smaller
   than those in the Caribbean primarily due to shorter tarsus length, and
   exhibit differences in body shape sexual dimorphism. American Flamingo
   eggs from Galapagos have smaller linear dimensions and volumes than
   those from the Caribbean. These findings are consistent with
   reproductive isolation of the American Flamingo population in Galapagos.}},

Abstract = {{Range expansion of native as well as exotic species often causes effects
   on the original species; however, not all range expansions are negative
   for breeding colonies consisting of mixed species. The Grey Heron (Ardea
   cinerea) has increased and expanded its distribution in Japan in the
   last 20 years. Its solitary and early nesting habits may facilitate
   establishment and persistence of colonies of mixed heron species. To
   examine whether the addition of Grey Herons has affected colony
   persistence and the number of established and abandoned colonies, 16
   years of monitoring data from before and after the expansion of Grey
   Herons around Ibaraki Prefecture in Japan were analyzed. Most newly
   established colonies were without Grey Herons before their expansion,
   but more than half of the established colonies contained Grey Herons
   after the expansion. The number of colony abandonments decreased after
   the Grey Heron expansion and most of these occurred in colonies that
   were without Grey Herons both before and after the expansion.
   Persistence periods were longer in colonies with Grey Herons than in
   colonies without Grey Herons. The expansion of Grey Herons into mixed
   heron colonies has promoted the persistence of mixed heron colonies, and
   local populations of colonial herons seemed to gain the benefit of
   colony sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is listed as a Species
   of High Concern in the United States Shorebird Conservation Plan due to
   a small population size and threats during its annual cycle. Previous
   studies of the American Oystercatcher have focused on Atlantic Coast
   populations; however, little is known about the reproductive success of
   the western Gulf Coast population. The objective of this study was to
   determine nest and brood survival of American Oystercatchers in Texas. A
   total of 337 nests and 121 broods were monitored on the Texas Gulf Coast
   during 2011-2013. The top model for nest survival in Program MARK
   included a linear decline in survival across the nesting season and as
   nests aged. Survival also declined as island size and foraging habitat
   near the nest site increased. The probability of a nest surviving from
   mean initiation date to hatching was 0.384 (95\% CI = 0.317, 0.451). The
   top model for brood survival included a linear decline in survival
   across the season and an increase in survival as broods aged. Brood
   survival also varied among years and coastal region. The probability of
   a brood surviving from mean hatch date to 35 days after hatch ranged
   from 0.397 (95\% CI = 0.204, 0.578) in 2013 to 0.887 (95\% CI = 0.673,
   0.964) in 2011 across all regions. Known causes of nest and brood loss
   included beach overwash, depredation, and starvation. This study
   provides the first estimates of nest and brood survival of the American
   Oystercatcher along the western Gulf Coast. The additional insight into
   patterns of nest and brood survival in this species will be useful for
   future conservation planning efforts that target breeding American
   Oystercatchers.}},

   Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus). The purpose of this study was to
   document Bar-headed Goose nesting locations, characterize nests and
   nesting strategies, and estimate daily nest survival (n = 235 nests)
   from eight areas of west-central Mongolia across three summers
   (2009-2011) using a modified Mayfield estimator. Bar-headed Goose daily
   nest survival ranged from 0.94 to 0.98, with a 3-year average nest
   success of 42.6\% during incubation. Bar-headed Geese were found to
   primarily nest on isolated pond and lake islands as previously reported,
   but were also documented regularly, though less frequently, along rocky
   cliffs in several regions of west-central Mongolia. Daily nest survival
   was higher for cliff nests than for island nests. Information-theoretic
   models indicated that nest survival decreased with nest age and varied
   annually with changing environmental conditions. Results of this study
   suggest that while Bar-headed Geese primarily rely on nesting island
   sites these sites may be more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance
   and predation events influenced by seasonal variation in environmental
   conditions, and that higher daily nest survival values documented for
   the less frequent cliff nest strategy may provide an important
   alternative strategy during poor island nest success years. Thus,
   conservation efforts for this and other waterbird species in the
   semiarid region should be focused on conserving nesting islands and
   protecting them from disturbance in areas of high livestock densities
   experiencing a rapidly warming climate.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of population size and trends are often necessary for
   wildlife conservation, but imperfect and variable rates of detection can
   lead to substantially biased counts during surveys. The influence of
   survey timing relative to timing of breeding on the counts recorded for
   five shorebird species during transect surveys at East Bay, Nunavut,
   Canada, from 2000 to 2010 was examined. Transect counts varied widely
   among species and years, and transect counts were most strongly
   predicted by the density of nests found during more intensive surveys.
   However, after accounting for this variation, survey counts were
   influenced substantially by survey timing. Surveys carried out shortly
   after the median date of nest initiation (similar to 2 days after)
   corresponded most closely to the densities of found nests, and if
   surveys were not within several days of the median date, the discrepancy
   between the two estimates was large. Although neither nest densities nor
   transect surveys are believed to be a perfect indication of local
   population status, these results suggest that the nearly inevitable
   variation in survey timing could introduce substantial bias into density
   estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands are under enormous pressure due to rapid economic development
   in China. Waterbirds, which depend on wetlands, are therefore facing a
   dramatic threat. Surveys were conducted in 19 Provinces in the winters
   of 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. Sites that support internationally important
   numbers of waterbirds were selected. Seven sites that support 20,000 or
   more waterbirds and 48 sites that support more than 1\% of the global or
   flyway population of at least one species were found in our survey. Ten
   (20.8\%) of these sites were protected and 10 (20.8\%) had no
   protection. Eight of the 10 unprotected sites were located along
   coastlines. Of 16 coastal wetland sites, 43.8\% were unprotected. The
   protection of wintering sites of waterbirds should be made a priority
   and more wetland sites, especially coastal wetland sites, should be
   protected. Additionally, an intensive site survey should be conducted to
   gain comprehensive knowledge of the distribution of wintering waterbirds

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that during the past 100 years the climate of
   the Antarctic Peninsula has changed from a relatively cold environment
   to an increasingly warmer one. The penguins that breed in the region are
   sensitive to oceanographic environmental and climatic conditions. They
   are considered the bellwether sentinels of the ocean because of their
   sensitivity to environmental changes. The present study aimed to
   determine the evolutionary history of the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis
   papua) and Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Admiralty Bay, King
   George Island A population genetics approach was used to examine the
   genetic variability of the two penguin species, searching to infer their
   demographics histories. The D-loop region from the mitochondrial DNA was
   sequenced in Adelie (n = 53) and Gentoo (n = 29) penguins. These species
   showed high genetic diversity, reflecting a large ancestral population
   size. The results also revealed that the Gentoo Penguin has had a stable
   population over the last 500,000 years, whereas Adelie Penguins showed a
   signal of population expansion estimated to have occurred between
   300,000 to 400,000 years ago. Results indicate that penguin species
   respond differently to climate change and that Adelie Penguins are more
   sensitive to such changes. High genetic diversity and stability of the
   populations in recent centuries could be important for predicting the
   response to future events.}},

Abstract = {{The Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) are
   often classified as separate species, but differing scientific opinions
   exist regarding the taxonomic status of these birds, as they exhibit
   similar behavior and hybridize in nature. The present study provides
   genetic data to help clarify this taxonomic issue. DNA was extracted
   from 10 individuals of each taxon from the states of Florida, USA (White
   Ibis) and Amapa, Brazil (Scarlet Ibis). The sequences of three
   mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were obtained from all
   individuals. The Scarlet Ibis and White Ibis did not share any
   haplotypes in mitochondrial genes nor in one nuclear marker. Species
   delimitation using Bayesian analysis, the Knowles-Carstens method and
   the genealogical sorting index demonstrated the Scarlet Ibis and White
   Ibis to be two different lineages and revealed a strong signal of
   speciation despite the polyphyly found in three of the four nuclear
   markers.}},

Abstract = {{Little information exists on nesting by seabirds and coastal waterbirds
   in Panama. The present study of the Gulf of Chiriqui complements our
   previous study of nesting waterbirds of the Gulf of Panama. In April
   2012, about 4,000 nests of seven species of seabirds and other colonial
   waterbirds were identified during a complete survey by small plane and
   boat within and adjacent to the Gulf of Chiriqui. Seventeen colony sites
   were found, 12 of which are reported here for the first time. Nesting
   species included Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster, the most abundant
   species with nearly 2,500 nests), Brown Pelican (Pelecanus
   occidentalis), Magnificent Frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), Bridled
   Tern (Onychoprion anaethetus; second nesting site for Panama), Wood
   Stork (Mycteria americana; third nesting site for Panama), Great Egret
   (Ardea alba), and Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis). The largest nesting site
   in the Gulf of Chiriqui was the Islas Ladrones, with 2,200 Brown Booby
   nests (the largest site for this species in Panama.) and 130 Magnificent
   Frigatebird nests. Unlike most of the sites found in this study, these
   islands are not currently officially protected.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the first detailed information on the migration
   routes and stopover sites for the endangered Scaly-sided Merganser
   (Mergus squamatus) breeding in Northeast China. Scaly-sided Mergansers
   (n = 4) were tagged with Platform Transmitter Terminals at Dailing in
   the southeastern Lesser Xingan Mountains of China during the late
   breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011. Two Scaly-sided Mergansers completed
   their autumn migration across the Yellow Sea, lasting 58 and 26 days,
   respectively, arriving on their wintering grounds at Yuanjiang River in
   Hunan Province and Xiushui River in Jiangxi Province of China. Both of
   the Scaly-sided Mergansers stopped at four sites and travelled 2,600 km
   from their breeding to wintering grounds. After a stay of 120 days, one
   of the marked individuals departed its wintering ground and returned to
   Dailing on 19 April 2012 and used a similar route as that in autumn
   migration and stopped at two sites. Wetlands at Ryonghung Gang estuary
   in North Korea, Yunshui River and Chidong Lake in Hubei Province of
   China, and Songjiang River in Jilin Province of China were used as major
   stopover sites. The determination of previously unknown wintering
   grounds and stopover sites in China and North Korea provides opportunity
   to discover more populations of the Scaly-sided Merganser outside its
   breeding areas.}},

Abstract = {{During the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 breeding seasons (November to June),
   there were 21 colonies of 13 species, with at least 40,000 to 50,000
   pairs of seabirds on six islands of Bahia Santa Maria-La Reforma in
   Mexico. Bahia Santa Maria maintains the largest breeding congregation of
   the west coast of Mexico for Laughing Gull (Leucophaeus atricilla;
   22,000 pairs), Royal Tern (Thalasseus maximus; 11,000 pairs) and Black
   Skimmer (Rynchops niger, 1,500 pairs). In the past decade, most of the
   species that breed on El Rancho Island (coastal dune habitat) have
   increased their population size, apparently related to a combination of
   factors such as colonies recently established (and hence still
   expanding) and increased habitat availability. On the other hand,
   species breeding on islands with mangroves seem to be decreasing (in
   particular the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) population), but
   with no obvious reason to explain these low numbers of some species.
   Despite the small size of the islands used by breeding seabirds, this
   coastal system supports important seabird populations and its
   conservation should be a priority.}},

Abstract = {{Mass strandings of seabirds occur frequently on many beaches worldwide
   and commonly involve penguins, petrels, shearwaters, and prions, among
   others. Large numbers of stranded albatrosses are rarely reported. In
   this paper, an unusual stranding event that involved five species of
   Procellariiformes, predominantly the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross
   (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), is described in southern Brazil.
   Carcasses and debilitated specimens of Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses
   (n = 125), unidentified petrels/shearwaters (Procellariidae; n = 63),
   White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis; n = 52), Great
   Shearwaters (Puffinus gravis; n = 11), Manx Shearwaters (Puffinus
   puffinus; n = 4) and Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris borealis, n=1) were
   found stranded between 15 and 22 March 2013. Atlantic Yellow-nosed
   Albatrosses (n = 20) and White-chinned Petrel (n = 1) were found alive
   and remained in the rehabilitation center for a few days before being
   released. A total of at least 256 birds were affected during the 8 days
   of the event, but a larger number likely remained undetected. Rescued
   Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses were not emaciated, and the causes of
   their stranding remain unknown. Equal or greater numbers of stranded
   petrels had been recorded previously in the area, but strandings of a
   large number of albatrosses are unusual in southern Brazil and
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Diving abilities of fledging Brown Boobies (Sula leucogaster) were
   characterized during the transition to independence period, and
   potential inter-sex differences (females are larger than males) were
   evaluated. Mean and maximum diving depths and mean dive duration
   increased gradually following the fledglings' first flights. The diving
   rate and the proportion of active dives (U type) increased notably
   between days 21 and 25 after first flight. However, maximum dive
   duration was not influenced by time since first flight, and none of the
   dive variables evaluated was influenced by sex. In Brown Boobies,
   acquisition of diving abilities by juveniles is a gradual process, and
   this can be an important driver of their extended post-fledging parental
   care.}},

   the capture and instrumentation of individuals. However, effective
   capture techniques for Great Egrets (Ardea alba) outside the breeding
   season remain elusive, particularly a method to attain robust sample
   sizes to investigate several aspects of biology. A handheld pneumatic
   net gun method was developed and successfully captured 97 Great Egrets
   in 121 trap days. No direct mortalities or substantial injuries
   occurred. The handheld pneumatic net gun was more cost-effective than
   commercially available or similar devices, and could prove useful for
   sensitive species where injury or mortality must be minimized or where
   the use of explosive devices is restricted.}},

Abstract = {{Regular surveys of waterbird colonies are needed to identify changes in
   abundance and distribution. Consistent surveys have been maintained in
   some regions, but one area where updated surveys were needed was
   southern Manitoba, where Lakes Winnipeg, Winnipegosis and Manitoba had
   not been jointly surveyed since 1979. In mid-June, 2012, an aerial
   survey of the region was conducted using digital photography to estimate
   abundance of six colonial waterbird species that are regular breeders on
   these lakes. Breeding by at least one of the six species was confirmed
   at 131 locations. Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) was
   the most abundant breeder (43,388 pairs, 47 colonies), followed by
   Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis, 41,819 pairs, 67 colonies),
   American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, 12,680 pairs, 20
   colonies), Common Tern (Sterna hirundo, 7,950 pairs, 31 colonies),
   Herring Gull (L. argentatus, 4,013 pairs, 90 colonies) and Caspian Tern
   (Hydroprogne caspia, 3,207 pairs, 14 colonies). Comparisons with earlier
   surveys in this region suggest that all six species have increased in
   abundance from the 1970s when populations were still recovering from
   earlier threats. However, Double-crested Cormorants, Caspian Terns and
   Common Terns show evidence of declines since the early 1990s.
   Standardized surveys of colonial waterbirds on these lakes should be
   maintained at 10-year intervals similar to the Great Lakes Monitoring
   Program.}},

Abstract = {{Barrier islands in Louisiana and elsewhere in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico region provide valuable breeding habitat for numerous waterbird
   species; however, these islands are also deteriorating at an alarming
   rate. Management and conservation of waterbird species in these dynamic
   environments require a better understanding of the breeding biology for
   northern Gulf of Mexico populations. Productivity parameters were
   investigated for Royal (Thalasseus maximus) and Sandwich (T
   sandvicensis) terns at the Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Refuge in
   Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons.
   Mean hatching success for Royal Tern was 77\% (n = 169 nests), while
   Sandwich Tern hatching success was 75\% (n = 130 nests). For both Royal
   and Sandwich terns, the estimated probability that a chick survived from
   hatching to fledging age was 55\% (n = 630 nestlings). Overall,
   estimated breeding success for Royal and Sandwich terns was 42.3\% and
   41\%, respectively. Chick growth rates were similar for both species and
   among islands, suggesting similar habitat quality among islands of Isles
   Dernieres Barrier Island Refuge. Growth rates (K) for both Royal and
   Sandwich terns were greatest for tarsus (K = 0.194 and K = 0.184,
   respectively), followed by mass (K = 0.143 and K = 0.164, respectively),
   and then wing cord (K = 0.125 and K = 0.110, respectively). Future
   studies evaluating causes of chick mortality would provide insight into
   the quality of habitat provided during this life stage. Chick growth
   rates may also be a useful indicator of ecological change and response
   to disturbances such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.}},

   Cranes (Grus americana) using marshes include ponds and emergent marsh,
   but the potential prey and energy availability in these habitat types
   have rarely been studied. In this study, we estimated daily digestible
   energy density for Whooping Cranes in different marsh and microhabitat
   types (i.e., pond, flooded emergent marsh). Also, indicator metrics of
   foraging habitat suitability for Whooping Cranes were developed based on
   seasonal water depth, prey biomass, and digestible energy density.
   Seasonal water depth (cm), prey biomass (g wet weight m(-2)), and
   digestible energy density (kcal g(-1)m-(2)) ranged from 0.0 to 50.2 +/-
   2.8, 0.0 to 44.8 +/- 22.3, and 0.0 to 31.0 +/- 15.3, respectively. With
   the exception of freshwater emergent marsh in summer, all available
   habitats were capable of supporting one Whooping Crane per 0.1 ha per
   day. All habitat types in the marshes had relatively higher suitability
   in spring and summer than in fall and winter. Our study indicates that
   based on general energy availability, freshwater marshes in the region
   can support Whooping Cranes in a relatively small area, particularly in
   spring and summer. In actuality, the spatial density of ponds, the flood
   depth of the emergent marsh, and the habitat conditions (e.g.,
   vegetation density) between adjacent suitable habitats will constrain
   suitable habitat and Whooping Crane numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Previous efforts to estimate the daily energy expenditure of American
   Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) have relied upon diurnal behavior
   observations or predictive allometric equations. American Black Duck
   behavior was quantified during morning crepuscular, diurnal, evening
   crepuscular and nocturnal periods to create a 24-hr time-energy budget.
   Behaviors and energy expenditure differed between periods and months,
   with hourly energy expenditure highest during the morning crepuscular
   period and lowest during the nocturnal period. Daily energy expenditure
   estimates based on a 24-hr time-energy budget were lower than estimates
   calculated from extrapolated diurnal behavioral data as well as a
   predictive allometric equation that uses a generalized dabbling duck
   resting metabolic rate. However, there was no difference between the
   24-hr time budget and a predictive allometric equation using American
   Black Duck specific resting metabolic rates. Future researchers and
   managers should acknowledge the assumptions of each methodology to
   estimate daily energy expenditure when using a bioenergetic approach to
   estimate carrying capacity.}},

Title = {{Estimating Effects of Habitat Characteristics on Abundances of Three
   Species of Secretive Marsh Birds in Central Florida}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{274-285}},

Abstract = {{Wetland loss has led to population declines of many species of North
   American marsh birds. However, due to the secretive nature of many of
   these species, there is uncertainty about their population status and
   habitat requirements. Recently developed techniques, such as the
   Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol and
   analytical methods that account for variable detection probabilities,
   can be used to improve both the quality and quantity of information
   about secretive marsh birds. In 2009 and 2010, point counts were
   conducted using the marsh bird monitoring protocol to count Least
   Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), Purple Gallinule (Porphyrio martinica) and
   Limpkin (Aramus guarauna) in the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, Florida.
   Habitat factors thought to influence abundance were compared using
   competing hierarchical mixture models. Abundance of Least Bittern had a
   positive relationship with amounts of emergent vegetative cover and
   interspersion (i.e., vegetation to water edge). Purple Gallinule
   abundance was positively related to percentage of area cover by
   floating-leaved vegetation, interspersion and diversity of vegetation
   type. Limpkin abundance was non-linearly related to vegetation cover in
   both years. In 2009, Limpkin abundance was positively related to
   vegetation to water edge and vegetation type diversity, and negatively
   related to vegetation edge in 2010. Results demonstrate that marsh
   habitats with greater amounts of vegetative cover, interspersion, and
   vegetation diversity will support the greatest abundance of this suite
   of marsh birds.}},

Abstract = {{As seabird nesting colonies have become concentrated on fewer managed
   islands, available nesting habitat for open-ground nesters such as
   Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) has rapidly become overgrown by
   guano-fertilized vegetation, leading managers to try various methods of
   vegetation control to open usable nesting habitat. Two of these methods,
   burning and synthetic weed barrier treatments, were tested in the
   summers of 2009 and 2010 to assess their ability to open and maintain
   Common Tern nesting habitat on two nearshore seabird nesting islands in
   Maine. Treatments were applied to overgrown habitat pre-nesting, and
   vegetation regrowth and Common Tern nest and fledging success were
   monitored in treated plots, untreated vegetation plots and occupied
   Common Tern nesting habitat. Burned areas did not remain open for the
   full nesting season, but regrew shortly after egg-laying, creating
   unsuitable vegetation structure and leading to near-complete nest
   failure in these plots. However, vegetation characteristics produced by
   the two different weed barrier treatments one a layer of muslin fabric
   overlaying newspaper mulch and the other a mosaic of synthetic turf and
   open ground were similar to vegetation in pre-existing Common Tern
   nesting habitat throughout the season. Common Tern nest and fledging
   success was similar in weed barrier plots (1.37 chicks/pair) and
   pre-existing Common Tern nesting habitat (1.38 chicks/pair). While
   burning may not be a useful technique for creating nesting habitat,
   synthetic weed barriers offer a promising short-term solution to
   vegetation overgrowth in nesting habitat of Common Terns and species
   with similar habitat requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic substrate has a large impact on aquatic plant and invertebrate
   assemblages and likely directly or indirectly influences waterbird
   distributions. The association of birds with various substrates can be
   important in survey design or habitat management. Northern Shoveler
   (Anas clypeata), Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Eared Grebe
   (Podiceps nigricollis), Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) and
   California Gull (L. californicus) densities on the hypersaline Great
   Salt Lake, Utah, were estimated to determine the association of bird
   distributions with benthic substrates. Three of the four groups of
   species monitored had densities that varied by benthic substrate; gulls
   were the exception. Eared Grebes occurred at the highest densities over
   calcareous reef-like structures known as bioherms, either as a result of
   ideal water depths for foraging or greater prey densities, than over
   other substrates. The highest densities of Northern Shovelers and Common
   Goldeneyes were observed Over mud substrates. This was likely due to mud
   being common near freshwater inflow sites and in lower salinity bays,
   areas waterfowl concentrate in because of the lower osmoregulatory
   demands compared to more pelagic areas of the Great Salt Lake. Knowing
   the relationship between waterbird densities and substrate will help
   managers estimate avian populations on hypersaline lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The dietary compositions of the three most abundant tern species
   breeding on Nakhilu and Omol-Karam Islands in the Persian Gulf were
   investigated to determine the dietary segregation between sympatric
   breeders. Chick dietary samples were collected from Bridled Tern (Sterna
   anaethetus), Lesser Crested Tern (S. bengalensis) and Swift Tern (S.
   bergii) in the 2010 and 2011 breeding seasons. Fish prey dominated the
   diet of the community (99\% of prey consumed), although shrimps
   (primarily the Green Tiger prawn (Penaeus semisulcatus) were present in
   the food samples from Lesser Crested and Swift tern chicks. Regurgitates
   of Bridled Tern contained on average 12.48 +/- 1.13 prey items (Range =
   3-30, n = 31), Lesser Crested Tern contained 1.14 +/- 0.01 (Range = 1-6,
   n = 365) and Swift Tern contained 1.08 +/- 0.01 (Range = 1-4, n = 132).
   Pianka Overlap Index (O-jk) in food type was highest between Lesser
   Crested Tern and Swift Tern (0.98), while there was less similarity
   between Bridled Tern and Lesser Crested Tern (0.21) and Bridled Tern and
   Swift Tern (0.16) prey items. The results showed significant difference
   between the prey selected among the three tern species studied here in
   weight and length. Prey length and weight increased from 1-2-week-old
   chicks to 5-6-week-old chicks in both the Lesser Crested and Swift
   terns. Although there is high dietary overlap in Lesser Crested and
   Swift terns, they are segregated in terms of prey size, which likely
   reduces competition for prey. Although, there was some overlap between
   the diets of the three tern species, diet segregation on the basis of
   prey species and prey size are the main factors that should contribute
   to reduced competitive interactions for food resources.}},

Abstract = {{Strong winters may increase mortality in avian species, with potentially
   severe consequences for populations. A period of 10 cold days during an
   otherwise mild winter occurred in the Wadden Sea during February 2012,
   causing a mass mortality of more than 1,100 Eurasian Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus ostralegus). This study investigated whether mortality was
   highest in certain bird-classes (sex, age, diet specialization). By
   comparing dead with live individuals captured before and after the cold
   spell, significantly more immature Eurasian Oystercatchers were found
   dead (> 60\%) than expected. Sex ratio did not differ significantly
   between dead and live individuals, the proportion of males being higher
   in both dead and live birds. All the dead individuals collected showed
   significantly smaller body masses (overall mean: 324 g) than live ones
   (overall mean: 457 g). Few individuals showed internal lesions or
   anatomical abnormalities, and no influenza virus was found. Dead
   Eurasian Oystercatchers had completely empty stomachs in 25\% and 37\%
   of the individuals in both study areas, Busum and Amrum, respectively;
   all other individuals showing only few prey remains. The most frequent
   prey items were common cockles (Cerastoderma edule). Based on bill
   shapes, most of the dead Eurasian Oystercatchers were bivalve
   specialists, and fewer than expected worm eaters died. From band
   recoveries (n = 19), many of the dead individuals originated from
   Scandinavia (37\%). The main reason for the high mortality appeared to
   be low food availability and quality before the cold spell combined with
   sudden low temperatures.}},

   along the Araucania Region Coast, South-central Chile}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The Red-legged Cormorant (Phalacrocorax gaimardi) is a neotropical
   cormorant with a moderately small population and is currently
   categorized as ``Near Threatened{''} by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature. The Red-legged Cormorant is distributed only
   along the coasts of Peru, Argentina and Chile; however, the most
   important breeding population for this species occurs within a small
   area in Chile. Between 1998 and 2000, the entire breeding population
   size of the Red-legged Cormorant and its distribution in Chile were
   determined, but some areas were poorly surveyed. The breeding population
   sizes of the Red-legged Cormorant were surveyed along the Araucania
   coast, an area in south-central Chile not considered in previous
   studies. A total of 3,175 nests and 13,018 adults were distributed over
   10 breeding colonies along the Araucania coast. Our results increased
   the known breeding population size of the Red-legged Cormorant in Chile
   by almost 62\% (from 5,018-5,218 to 8,1938,393 breeding pairs) and the
   rangewide population estimate by almost 43\% (from 30,000 to 43,018
   individuals). This area could be one of the most important breeding
   areas for this species throughout its range. Currently, the colonies of
   Piureo-Puaucho (1,506 nests), Nigue (1,009 nests) and Punta Ronca
   (Queule) (964 nests) represent almost 42\% of the breeding population of
   this species in Chile, so these breeding sites should be a priority for
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Three avian footprints from a well-known early Eocene fossil track
   locality in Utah appear to represent an otherwise unknown stilt-like
   bird, possibly referable to the Recurvirostridae. The bird that made
   these tracks had very long legs but relatively short toes and was
   probably somewhat smaller than modern stilts (Himantopus). There was a
   vestigial hind toe and the feet were webbed, but the webbing was reduced
   more than in Recurvirostra or Cladorhynchus, but not nearly as much as
   in Himantopus. This may constitute the oldest evidence yet found of a
   recurvirostid-like bird, although the family probably originated even
   earlier if it gave rise to flamingos (Phoenicopteridae), which were
   already in existence by the early and middle Eocene.}},

Title = {{Evidence for Genetic Monogamy but Low Mate Retention in the North
   American Black Tern (Chlidonias niger surinamensis)}},

Abstract = {{Eleven family groups (n = 22 adults, 28 chicks) of North American Black
   Terns (Chlidonias niger surinamensis) were genotyped at four polymorphic
   loci in a pilot study to determine the genetic mating system of this
   socially monogamous species. Samples were collected between 2003 and
   2008 at two colony sites in Wisconsin (USA) that differed in structural
   complexity of the breeding habitat and nest density, and from families
   in which the adult males (putative fathers) varied with respect to body
   condition. Thus, both ecological and individual variations were explored
   as possible factors influencing the extent of extra-pair paternity. No
   mismatched alleles were detected, however, between chicks and their
   putative parents, suggesting that extra-pair paternity is negligible in
   this subspecies. Despite the small sample size, the combined probability
   of detecting an allelic exclusion at one or more loci was 0.998,
   indicating sufficient power to detect a case of extra-pair paternity if
   it occurred. Data obtained from recaptures of adults banded over a
   10-year period (2000-2009) indicated that inter-year mate retention was
   low (similar to 20\%) and was observed only in pairs that remained
   together in consecutive years. No ``divorced{''} mates of recaptured
   adults were encountered in subsequent years, suggesting that frequent
   mate switching is due more to the death or disappearance of the mate
   than to intentional dissolution of the pair bond. The results of this
   pilot study provide the first evidence of genetic monogamy in Black
   Terns and suggest that low mate fidelity is related to low breeding site
   fidelity, a characteristic common in birds that breed in unstable
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Although the prey of Reddish Egrets (Egretta rufescens) generally
   consists of shallow-water, euryhaline fish species, rangewide
   differences in breeding season diet have not been examined. Furthermore,
   the relative proportions of the two Reddish Egret color morphs vary from
   east to west across the species' range. Color morph may influence
   foraging efficiency, but variations in prey across the species' range
   and between morphs is undocumented. By examining boluses from Reddish
   Egret (n = 109) nestlings, prey species proportions were compared
   between morphs, among regions and among colonies within Texas. Between
   regions, prey species and proportion of species differed widely;
   however, fish species with similar life histories were selected across
   the Reddish Egret's range (Bahamas: 100\% sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon
   variegatus); Texas: 85\% sheepshead minnow; Baja California Sur: 49\%
   American shadow goby (Quietula y-cauda); Yucatan: 64\% Yucatan pupfish
   (C. artifrons)). Within the Laguna Madre in Texas, significant
   differences in prey species were not detected between morphs (F-(1,F-61)
   = 1.36, P = 0.224); however, prey mass by species differed between
   colonies (F-(1,F-60) = 2.68, P = 0.010). While our results only pertain
   to Reddish Egret diet during the breeding season, this study increases
   our understanding of Reddish Egret ecology and provides initial diet
   information across the species' range.}},

Abstract = {{Because Belted Kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon) eat a diet comprised
   primarily of fish they are a useful indicator species for aquatic
   contaminants such as mercury. Monitoring efforts generally compare
   nesting success or tissue contaminant concentrations from contaminated
   sites with reference sites. In contrast, this study examined subtler
   potential effects of mercury accumulation by quantifying plumage
   coloration (structural and melanin based) of nesting adult Belted
   Kingfishers and relating it to individual mercury concentrations.
   Mercury exposure was associated with increased brightness of plumage
   color consistent with the hypothesis that mercury slows the production
   of melanin. Clear sex differences in the chroma and hue of blue body
   feathers identified during this study suggest that Belted Kingfishers
   possesses cryptic dimorphism beyond the rufous ``belt,{''} and thus
   mercuryinduced alterations in blue plumage could reduce fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The Torrent Duck (Merganetta armata) is one of four species of waterfowl
   that live in fast flowing rivers. Torrent Ducks feed on benthic
   invertebrates in mountain rivers from Venezuela to Argentina. Prey
   selection by Torrent Ducks was investigated by comparing the proportion
   of prey taxa in their feces with the proportion available in river
   benthos. Feces and benthos were sampled during spring and autumn at
   sites with different precipitation levels in northwestern Argentine
   Patagonia. Energy values of the most important prey items were evaluated
   and the results adjusted for the amount of chitin body proportions. The
   average energy value of each individual prey item was 3.60 J in
   Gripopterygidae, 5.88 J in Simuliidae, 11.48 J in Atalophlebiinae and
   12.25 J in Smicridea spp. These four invertebrate taxa represented
   approximately 80\% of Torrent Duck diet. Prey availability and energy
   value alone could not explain the total Torrent Duck diet, and it was
   necessary to consider other factors such as aspects of prey natural
   history and their distribution in the benthos. Most consumed items were
   filter-feeding species (Simuliidae and Smicridea spp.) that inhabited
   rock surfaces that were more accessible to Torrent Ducks.
   Gripopterygidae and Atalophlebiinae were less accessible as they inhabit
   in the lower part of rocks. Diet information can be used to assess the
   availability of the most important prey items of Torrent Ducks in
   different rivers, and thus to estimate an important feature of habitat
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{By 2013, six of 27 Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) from four Dutch
   colonies that had received light level geolocators in 2010-2011 had been
   recaptured. All six recovered individuals migrated to West Africa, but
   whereas one individual flew there nonstop, the others made stops of
   varying length en route. These included flights of 2,000-6,000 km
   between major stopovers, achieving travel speeds over 1,000 km/day. In
   addition to the single previously known postbreeding stopover, Lake
   Usselmeer, this work revealed postbreeding stopovers at the Alboran Sea,
   the seas near the Canary Islands and at the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania.
   Staging durations varied between 2 and 35 days, and the longer the
   staging took, the longer the subsequent flights were. In the West
   African nonbreeding region, the Black Terns with geolocators staged at
   the Banc d'Arguin, the marine continental edge seas between Senegal and
   Liberia, and the Gulf of Guinea, or went as far south as the Benguela
   Current off Namibia. Most birds spent most of their time far offshore.
   Northward migration for the three birds with active geolocators took
   38-39 days with staging episodes near the Canary Islands and in the
   Mediterranean west of Italy. One individual crossed the Sahara from
   Senegal to northern Algeria in 3 days. After arrival in Europe, travel
   speeds were lower than when in transit from West Africa. Even with a
   sample size of six, we showed that Black Terns are long-distance
   migrants with substantial individual variation in migration patterns,
   including the use of staging sites, stopover times and travel distances.
   The variation in itineraries may imply that the distribution of the
   marine resources they rely on are relatively unpredictable. It remains
   to be seen whether the variability seen here reflects differences in
   otherwise fixed individual strategies or whether Black Terns are truly
   highly flexible.}},

Abstract = {{Rynchops niger intercedens, one of the South American subspecies of the
   Black Skimmer, is a widely distributed neotropical bird for which many
   ecological aspects, such as migratory routes and site fidelity, are
   unknown. Two distinct breeding phenologies have been reported for this
   subspecies, which may create the genetic isolation of populations. Six
   microsatellite loci were used to study the genetic structure of the
   Black Skimmer in southern South America, comparing breeding populations
   from Brazil and Argentina and individuals from the main non-breeding
   site at Argentina. A weak genetic differentiation between colonies,
   although statistically significant, was observed. This low genetic
   structure (despite different breeding phenologies) could be explained by
   demographic history of these populations and/or the effect of a very
   important non-breeding site in southern South America shared by these
   populations. Further studies applying a broader range of molecular
   markers plus improvement of extant banding efforts are required to
   better understand the dispersal mechanisms of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The first information on the morphometry and sexual size dimorphism of
   the sympatric South American (Sterna hirundinacea), Cayenne (Thalasseus
   sandvicensis eurygnathus) and Royal (T. maximus maximus) terns from the
   Patagonia region in Argentina is provided, and a discriminant analysis
   to sex the three species is used. Morphological characters were obtained
   from South American Terns (n = 83), Cayenne Terns (n = 63) and Royal
   Terns (n = 20). All species were sexed using polymerase chain
   reaction-based molecular techniques. Sexes in the three tern species
   were only slightly dimorphic in size. Male Cayenne and South American
   terns were significantly larger than females in bill length, bill depth
   and head length. Royal Terns, in contrast, showed a high overlap in most
   morphological measurements, with head length being the only measurement
   that differed significantly between sexes. Head length correctly sexed
   89\% of South American Terns and 75\% of Royal Terns, while a function
   including bill depth and head length correctly sexed 78\% of Cayenne
   Terns. Our results provide a valuable tool for rapid sexing in the field
   of these three Patagonian terns, although reliable sexing in Cayenne and
   Royal terns should be preferentially achieved using a combination of
   morphometric and molecular sexing.}},

Abstract = {{The Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens) is the rarest and least studied
   species of heron in North America and is a species of conservation
   concern throughout its range. Foraging behavior and foraging success of
   the Reddish Egret were studied by focusing on whether their foraging
   behavior or success varied with age, color morph, group size, and
   habitat measures. Foraging individuals (n = 372) were video-recorded in
   the Laguna Madre of Texas, USA, from March 2008-April 2010. Adult
   Reddish Egrets were 30-250\% more successful foragers than juveniles,
   and groups were 32-44\% more successful foragers than solitary foragers.
   Foraging success was similar between color morphs. The more specialized
   foraging behaviors of canopy feeding, wing flicking, and foot-stirring
   had the highest success, but were employed infrequently. Four
   environmental variables (wind speed, light intensity, water depth, and
   percent seagrass coverage) were found to influence foraging success, but
   accounted for only 3\% of the variation in foraging behavior. Our
   results suggest that environmental variables have little influence on
   foraging behavior of Reddish Egrets in the Laguna Madre, and we suggest
   that characteristics of the prey have a stronger influence. An
   understanding of how environmental variables influence foraging behavior
   and success may allow us to better assess habitat quality or possibly
   aid in identification of highly productive foraging sites and allow for
   more targeted conservation actions to those habitats that promote high
   foraging success.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about migration of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus
   magellanicus) in the Pacific Ocean. We used satellite telemetry to
   determine the post-breeding movement patterns of recently molted male
   Magellanic Penguins (n = 6) at Punihuil, southern Chile, in 2006. Five
   individuals went north, stopping at two separate wintering areas along
   the coast, while one went 300 km south to waters inland of the island of
   Chiloe, Chile. The most commonly used wintering area (n = 3) was 600-800
   km north of the breeding colony, near the Gulf of Arauco, Chile, where
   high levels of primary productivity are common. Magellanic Penguin
   wintering areas coincided with important areas for other seabirds and
   overlapped with human fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of infrared cameras and plasticine eggs were used to
   identify potential nest predators of Flightless Steamer-Ducks (Tachyeres
   pteneres) and Flying Steamer-Ducks (T patachonicus) and to evaluate the
   relative efficacy of these methods for identifying predators. Cameras
   were set up at 31 artificial nests with plasticine eggs and at four
   Flightless and two Flying steamer-duck nests. Two avian predators,
   Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) and Southern Crested Caracara
   (Caracara plancus), and two mammalian predators, Fuegian Culpeo fox
   (Pseudalopex culpaeus lycoides) and American mink (Neovison vison), were
   identified as depredating artificial nests from photos. Active
   Flightless and Flying steamer-duck nests were found only on islets, and
   from the photos the Chimango and Southern Crested caracaras were
   identified as nest predators. Mammalian predators were not photographed
   on islets (neither on artificial nor natural nests). Though the
   potential predator community at Lapataia Bay was small, there were
   considerable similarities in physical evidence and marks left at nests,
   especially within avian predators. Also, depredated nests were sometimes
   revisited by other predators and these multi-predator visits sometimes
   caused changes to the appearance of the depredated nest following
   departure of the initial predator. The cameras provided an objective
   method for definitive identification of nest predators.}},

Abstract = {{As young seabirds approach independence, a range of tactics are
   sometimes employed in an attempt to secure additional food items prior
   to departing the nest. Detailed here are previously unreported
   kleptoparasitic and predatory behaviors of juvenile Brown Boobies (Sula
   leucogaster) on Ashmore Reef in the Timor Sea. From 14-20 November 2013,
   the number of Greater Crested Terns (Thalasseus bergii) breeding
   adjacent to a Brown Booby colony was reduced from 128 adults attending
   the colony to 59 adults. During this time, two juvenile Brown Boobies
   were observed depredating the eggs of the Greater Crested Terns and
   ingesting prey regurgitated by Greater Crested Terns. The factors that
   lead to this unusual foraging behavior in juvenile Brown Boobies are not
   known; however, low body mass and hunger may play a role. Repeated years
   of predation of Greater Crested Tern eggs by Brown Boobies could lead to
   the abandonment of this colony.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{To better understand how time of day and light level affect foraging
   patterns and feeding success in a primarily nocturnal wading bird,
   observations were made on Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nyticorax
   nycticorax) at an artificial weir located in the Little Arkansas River
   in Wichita, Kansas. Numbers of foraging birds at the weir were recorded
   using intervals of 1-hr periods during both day and nighttime. Strike
   rates, capture rates, relocation rates, prey sizes, and rates of
   aggression were compared. A similar number of Black-crowned Night-Herons
   used this site during the day and at night. Also mean strike rates,
   capture rates, and relocation rates did not differ between day and
   night. However, focal birds captured significantly larger fish during
   the day, when they also experienced higher rates of intra- and
   interspecific aggression. Since basic foraging patterns did not differ
   by time of day, it is likely that differences in the behavior,
   detection, and availability of prey account for the capture of larger
   fish during the day than at night. Diurnal foraging activity by
   Black-crowned Night-Herons appears to be important in meeting increased
   energy demands during the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatic mercury concentrations of Pectoral Sandpiper (Calidris
   melanotos) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus collected from the central
   Illinois River Valley, Illinois, during early fall migration in 2007
   were examined. Mean and median mercury concentrations were significantly
   greater in the livers of Pectoral Sandpipers (0.30 and 0.28 mu g/g wet
   weight, respectively) than in Killdeer (0.07 and 0.06 mu g/g wet weight,
   respectively). Differences in foraging ecology between these species
   likely account for the observed differences in tissue mercury
   concentrations. In general, mercury concentrations were low in these
   species relative to other shorebirds and can serve as baseline for
   future monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A workshop titled The Status of Gavia: Conservation in Black and White
   was held at the 5th North American Ornithological Conference on 14
   August 2012, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The last such North
   American meeting focused on loons was at the American Ornithologist's
   Union meetings in Minneapolis in 1997. During the interim 15 years, our
   knowledge of this group of diving birds in North America has increased
   significantly. From the 2012 workshop, as well as from contributions of
   authors unable to attend, 15 papers are presented in this special issue
   under five broad headings: behavior, life history and population
   ecology, movements and migration, habitat and landscape requirements and
   contaminants. Some highlights include the first data on sex ratios in
   Common Loon (Gavia immer) chicks, the first adult survival estimates for
   Red-throated Loons (G. stellata), and first reports of mercury exposure
   in Yellow-billed Loons (G. adamsii) from Alaska and Canada. In addition,
   a new long-distance migration record for the Common Loon, a landscape
   assessment of Common Loons in Massachusetts, and oil concentrations in
   loons wintering in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (one of the areas hit
   hardest by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill) are documented. We hope this
   collection of papers will be useful to researchers and wildlife managers
   in North America and abroad.}},

Abstract = {{We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sex identification
   technique to evaluate the sex ratios of pre-fledged juvenile Common
   Loons (Gavia immer) from three breeding populations in northern Michigan
   and northern Wisconsin, and of dead adult Common Loons migrating through
   Lake Huron. Results of these analyses show that more juvenile males than
   females fledged from all three breeding populations, although none of
   these biases differed significantly from parity. The sex ratio of
   migratory adults was at parity. No parental or territory quality
   indicators were significantly associated with the sex of chicks fledged
   from one intensely studied northern Michigan population at Seney
   National Wildlife Refuge. A significant male bias in adult
   re-observation of Common Loons banded as juveniles at the wildlife
   refuge was not solely attributable to the modest male bias recorded at
   fledging, and thus suggests a pattern of female-biased post-fledging
   mortality and/or female-biased adult dispersal in Common Loons.}},

Abstract = {{Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed (G. adamsii) loons nest
   sympatrically in Arctic regions. These related species likely face
   similar constraints and requirements for nesting success; therefore, use
   of similar habitats and direct competition for nesting habitat is
   likely. Both of these loon species must select a breeding lake that
   provides suitable habitat for nesting and raising chicks; however,
   characteristics of nest site selection by either species on interior
   Arctic lakes remains poorly understood. Here, logistic regression was
   used to compare structural and habitat characteristics of all loon nest
   locations with random points from lakes on the interior Arctic Coastal
   Plain, Alaska. Results suggest that both loon species select nest sites
   to avoid predation and exposure to waves and shifting ice. Loon nest
   sites were more likely to be on islands and peninsulas (odds ratio =
   16.13, 95\% CI = 4.64-56.16) than mainland shoreline, which may help
   loons avoid terrestrial predators. Further, nest sites had a higher
   degree of visibility (mean degrees of visibility to 100 and 200 m) of
   approaching predators than random points (odds ratio = 2.57, 95\% CI =
   1.22-5.39). Nests were sheltered from exposure, having lower odds of
   being exposed to prevailing winds (odds ratio = 0.34, 95\% CI =
   0.13-0.92) and lower odds of having high fetch values (odds ratio =
   0.46, 95\% CI = 0.22-0.96). Differences between Pacific and
   Yellow-billed loon nesting sites were subtle, suggesting that both
   species have similar general nest site requirements. However,
   Yellow-billed Loons nested at slightly higher elevations and were more
   likely to nest on peninsulas than Pacific Loons. Pacific Loons
   constructed built up nests from mud and vegetation, potentially in
   response to limited access to suitable shoreline due to other
   territorial loons. Results suggest that land managers wishing to protect
   habitats for these species should focus on lakes with islands as well as
   shorelines sheltered from exposure to prevailing wind and ice patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Animal signals play an important role in mate attraction and territory
   defense, and animals may benefit by adopting signaling strategies that
   maximize effective communication in the face of changing environmental
   conditions. In this study, a custom-designed microphone array was used
   to collect landscape-scale recordings of the acoustic signaling behavior
   of Common Loons (Gavia immer) along a 10-km transect spanning three
   lakes in eastern Ontario, Canada. Recordings were collected during the
   early part of the breeding season during two consecutive years
   (2008-2009). Analyses focused on understanding how the vocal output of
   Common Loons varied with time of day, time of year, and in response to
   variation in weather. Common Loons showed significant diel variation in
   vocal output, producing more wail, yodel, and tremolo calls at night
   than during the day. Common Loons showed significant seasonal variation
   in vocal output, producing fewer wail, yodel, and tremolo calls as the
   first month of the breeding season progressed. Common Loons showed
   significant differences in vocal behavior with changing weather
   conditions, producing more calls at cold temperatures, with low wind
   speed and air pressure, and when rain was light or absent. Microphone
   array recordings were used to estimate signal transmission properties of
   Common Loon vocalizations, demonstrating that wail, yodel, and tremolo
   calls transmit significantly farther at night than during the day. These
   results provide quantitative details of Common Loon vocal signaling
   strategies, revealing that this species calls when abiotic conditions
   are ideal for long-range signaling.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of an Aggressive Vocalization in the Common Loon (Gavia immer):
   A Review}},

Abstract = {{Unlike most waterbirds, Common Loons (Gavia immer) have a dynamic vocal
   repertoire that includes the high-amplitude wail, tremolo, and yodel.
   This paper is a review of the acoustic structure of the yodel, an
   aggressive warning signal only given by male Common Loons. The context
   in which males yodel is described along with the possible adaptive
   functions of this signal. The yodel is the most acoustically complex
   vocalization of the Common Loon and contains a wealth of information
   about the signaler. Suites of frequency and time elements of the yodel
   appear to communicate information about the identity of the signaler,
   which may be important for neighbor-stranger, mate, and kin recognition.
   The peak frequencies of the final note of the introductory phrase and
   repeat phrases also appear to communicate the condition-dependent
   fighting ability. Finally, the number of repeat phrases a male adds to
   its yodel appears to communicate the aggressive motivation, or the
   willingness a male Common Loon has to escalate a contest. Under various
   contexts not necessarily unique to Common Loons, these functions may be
   mutually beneficial to signalers and conspecific and heterospecific

Abstract = {{Common Loon (Gavia burner) migration pathways have been previously
   identified using resightings, band recoveries, and satellite tracking
   with platform terminal transmitters, but there remains much to be
   learned. No band recoveries or resightings of Common Loons from
   Louisiana have been documented to date, and it is unclear where Common
   Loons from this region migrate and breed. On 29 March 2011, as part of a
   pilot study, we implanted two platform terminal transmitters in Common
   Loons wintering off the Louisiana coast. Both individuals migrated to
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Previous research using satellite telemetry on
   migrating Common Loons in the western USA states (Nevada and Montana)
   showed they migrated to Saskatchewan, but wintered at Lake Mead, Nevada,
   the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. Our findings are of
   interest as Common Loons from the same breeding area in Saskatchewan
   overwinter in different regions of North America.}},

Title = {{Size and Retention of Breeding Territories of Yellow-billed Loons (Gavia
   adamsii) in Alaska and Canada}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Abstract = {{Yellow-billed Loons (Gavia adamsii) breed in lakes in the treeless
   Arctic and are globally rare. Like their sister taxa, the
   well-documented Common Loon (G. immer) of the boreal forest,
   Yellow-billed Loons exhibit strong territorial behavior during the
   breeding season. Little is known about what size territories are
   required, however, or how readily territories are retained from year to
   year. An understanding of territory dynamics and size is needed by
   management agencies as most of the U.S. breeding population of
   Yellow-billed Loons resides in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska
   where oil and gas development is expected to increase in the next few
   decades. Using locational data from a set of Yellow-billed Loons marked
   with satellite transmitters, we quantified an index of territory radius
   for each of three breeding populations: two in Alaska and one in Canada.
   The mean territory radius was 0.42 km for Yellow-billed Loons summering
   on lakes within the Seward Peninsula in northwest Alaska, 0.69 km for
   Yellow-billed Loons within the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska
   (encompasses the National Petroleum Reserve), and 0.96 km for
   Yellow-billed Loons within Daring Lake in mainland Canada. In this
   study, the mean territory radius on the Arctic Coastal Plain was about
   half the distance identified in stipulations for industrial development
   in the National Petroleum Reserve. The range in territory size among
   areas corresponded to a gradient in size of lakes used by Yellow-billed
   Loons with territories at the two Alaska sites on lakes averaging < 200
   ha while territories in Canada were generally on much larger lakes. In
   the year after capture, 71\% of Yellow-billed Loons retained territories
   that were held the previous year. Most Yellow-billed Loons that lost
   their territories wandered over a large area within 6 km of their prior
   territory. No Yellow-billed Loons occupied new territories, though one
   reacquired its prior territory after a 1-year hiatus. Retention of a
   territory in a subsequent year was positively related to early arrival
   dates at the breeding site. For Yellow-billed Loons on the Arctic
   Coastal Plain, this relationship was quite strong with a week lag in
   arrival decreasing the probability of retaining a territory by 80\%.
   These collective observations, in combination with theoretical studies
   of population regulation by floaters (non-territorial birds), suggest
   that lake habitat suitable for breeding Yellow-billed Loons may
   currently limit population size in this species.}},

Abstract = {{During 25 field seasons between 1988 and 2012, Biodiversity Research
   Institute captured and uniquely color-banded 2,730 adult Common Loons
   (Gavia immer) on breeding territories in 11 States and seven Provinces
   throughout North America. Body mass was obtained from each individual;
   tarsus and bill measurements were obtained from more than half the birds
   banded. Clinal variation in body mass, tarsal width and bill length was
   observed. Body mass varied from 2,700 g to 7,600 g; loons from
   populations in the upper Great Lakes and central Canada were smallest,
   and size increased to the east and west. Examination of band return and
   satellite tracking data resulted in three migration distance groups: <
   1,500 km; 1,500-3,500 km; and >= 3,500 km. Body mass was inversely
   related to migration distance. Males were significantly larger (> 20\%)
   than associated females, and within-pair differences increased with
   decreasing migration distance (i.e., males from coastal States were
   proportionally larger than their mates compared to interior State
   pairs).}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of wildlife population viability through measurements of
   contaminant stressors, such as water mercury concentrations, were
   modified with variables specific to New York's Adirondack Park to
   develop a wildlife criterion value for the Common Loon (Gavia immer).
   Biotic and abiotic samples were collected for mercury analysis on 44
   Adirondack lakes over a 2-year period (2003 to 2004). From 1998 to 2007,
   Common Loon blood samples were collected for mercury analysis from the
   44 lakes, loon feather samples from 40 lakes, and nonviable eggs from 29
   lakes. It was determined that 2.00 ng Hg/L or less in the water was
   small enough to prevent male Adirondack Common Loons from accumulating
   mercury in levels high enough to impact reproductive success and
   behavior, while a water sample of 1.69 ng Hg/L or less was small enough
   to not cause impacts to female Common Loons. These wildlife criterion
   values are greater than the wildlife criterion value of 1.30 ng Hg/L
   applied to avian species by the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative.
   The Common Loon-based wildlife criterion value provides a valuable
   estimate of the mercury thresholds associated with biotic impacts due to
   mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems, enabling legislators to
   integrate these standards into policies that better protect
   environmental quality. Based on the water samples collected, it was
   estimated that the wildlife criterion value accurately predicted the
   protection of 61\% of female and 73\% of male Adirondack loons. More
   rigorous sampling of the abiodc compartment over a wider temporal and
   spatial scale is necessary to fully understand how water quality
   parameters relate to Common Loon reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{On 20 April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig located 66 km
   southeast of the Louisiana coast exploded and, by the time the pipeline
   was capped in July, estimates of 4.9 million barrels of oil were
   released in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons make up a small percentage of petroleum (< 5\%), but are
   the most toxic with known negative impacts on wildlife and humans.
   Because of their lifestyle and trophic standing, seabirds are often
   impacted by marine spills. To test for the presence of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons, we captured and tested blood in Common Loons
   (Gavia immer), a winter migrant that spends 4-5 months in the Gulf of
   Mexico. Common Loons were captured at night, using spotlighting and a
   large dip net off the Louisiana coast, during January-March in 2011 and
   2012. A total of 38 Common Loons were caught and sampled (17 in 2011 and
   21 in 2012). Both the concentrations and frequency of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons present in Common Loons appear to be increasing
   between years; however, concentrations were low (<10 ppb). In 2012,
   petrogenic alkyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, those derived from
   petroleum, were significantly higher than pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, derived from combustion and anthropogenic sources. It
   remains unknown if current levels have any adverse impacts on Common
   Loon health, reproduction and survival.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of lakeshore development on reproductive success of Common
   Loons (Gavia inimer) were examined in New York State's Adirondack Park.
   It was hypothesized that loon reproductive success would be negatively
   affected by the increased amount of shoreline development that has been
   occurring in the Park in recent years. Additionally, it was further
   hypothesized that the average distance from the nest site to the nearest
   point of development would be greater for successful nests than for
   failed nests. Historical nest productivity data collected from banded
   Common Loons on 53 lakes over a period of 7 years were evaluated along
   with residential development data collected during two field seasons in
   2004 and 2005. Mean distance from successful nests (n=28) to the nearest
   shoreline development unit (442.7 m, Range: 41.4-1,540.0 m) was greater
   than the mean distance from failed nests (n=32) to the nearest shoreline
   development unit (343.1 m, Range: 2.2-1,222.9 m). Presence of nesting
   pairs was significantly related (R-2=0.25, P=0.001) to increased
   shoreline length and decreased amount of development. Common Loon chick
   hatching success was significantly related to the density of development
   on small lakes (P=0.033), but not on large lakes (P>0.05). Our results
   indicate that the amount of development on lakes is not as important to
   nesting Common Loons as the placement of development in clusters along
   lakeshores. The clustering of development on one part of the lake will
   allow Common Loons to nest a distance away from developed areas. Thus,
   this study provides additional support for the buffering of loon nesting
   areas from development as a conservation/management tool to enhance
   their reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Shoreline attributes and extensive field surveys of aquatic vegetation
   and animal presence were used to determine probabilities of Common Loon
   (Gavia immer) nesting for segments of lakeshore on 35 lakes in north
   central Minnesota. Model development used both a general linear mixed
   model and random forest classifier approach. The resulting nesting
   habitat models were used to predict nesting sites for a small set of
   independent lakes. Shoreline segments with low mean fetch and littoral
   slope, fewer developed shoreline parcels, and higher aquatic plant
   richness had higher probabilities of nesting. In addition, significantly
   more nesting sites were on islands than on mainland shoreline segments.
   The locations of predicted nesting sites on the independent lake set
   compared favorably to the locations of observed nests. The ability to
   predict suitable Common Loon nesting sites should lead to the greater
   protection or restoration of these valuable areas and enhance
   conservation efforts across the state.}},

Abstract = {{Large variations in the summering population size of Red-throated Loons
   (Gavia stellata) have occurred in recent decades in Alaska. Little
   information exists about annual or seasonal survival rates of adult
   Redthroated Loons. This study used tracking data from satellite
   transmitters implanted into 33 Red-throated Loons captured on breeding
   areas in Alaska to estimate annual survival with the sampling effort
   split between two study periods: 2000-2002 and 2008-2010. Mortality was
   inferred from transmitted sensor data that indicated body temperature of
   the Red-throated Loon and voltage of the transmitter's battery. Two
   definitive mortalities occurred, resulting in an annual survival
   estimate of 0.920 (SE = 0.054). The fates of two additional Red-throated
   Loons were ambiguous and, when treated as mortalities, the annual
   survival estimate was 0.838 (SE = 0.074). All four putative mortalities
   occurred during the non-breeding season in the early study period.
   Oceanic conditions, indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, appeared
   to differ between the study periods with higher Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation values associated with the early study period. Given that
   high values for Pacific Decadal Oscillation were also associated with
   the large decline of Red-throated Loons observed in Alaska during
   1977-1993, this study suggests that survival of adult Red-throated Loons
   may vary in relation to the state of the marine ecosystem and thus
   contribute to long-term variation in population trends.}},

Abstract = {{Common Loons (Gavia immer) recolonized Massachusetts in 1975 from a
   single breeding pair on the Quabbin Reservoir. Since then, the
   population has grown to 33 pairs that occupy 14 lakes, but the full
   recovery potential of the population is unknown. This study analyzed
   population data and habitat suitability, as well as compared population
   dynamics, of the Common Loon population in Massachusetts to the Common
   Loon population in New Hampshire to determine if a recovery similar to
   the one seen in New Hampshire is possible. Results indicated that a
   large-scale recovery may be possible as enough suitable habitat exists
   to support about 300 pairs statewide. Current population stresses have
   not led to a decline; thus, management efforts can be increased to
   encourage further growth. Due to a small initial population, some
   aspects of a small population paradigm and an allee affect may have
   contributed to the slow population growth since 1975 as compared to
   Vermont and New Hampshire.}},

Abstract = {{The Common Loon (Gavia immer), a top trophic-level piscivorous predator,
   was used as an indicator species to assess mercury exposure and risk in
   aquatic ecosystems in the Adirondack Park of NewYork State. Mercury
   levels in Common Loons were related to long-term reproductive success to
   evaluate the effects of mercury contamination on the breeding population
   in the Park and enable the development of a mercury hazard profile.
   Common Loons were sampled and monitored on selected study lakes from
   1998-2007. Lake acidity correlated with Common Loon mercury levels, with
   more acidic lakes exhibiting higher mercury concentrations in Common
   Loons. Based on mercury body burden estimated by blood mercury exposure,
   21\% of males and 8\% of females were at high risk for behavioral and
   reproductive impacts, while feather mercury exposure estimated that 37\%
   of males and 7\% of females were at high risk. Female and male Common
   Loons in the highest exposure category showed a 32\% and 56\% reduction,
   respectively, in the number of chicks fledged per year, compared to
   individuals in the lowest exposure category. Thirteen percent of the
   Adirondack Common Loon eggs sampled were at high risk for mercury
   exposure. Population model results indicated that the portion of the
   Adirondack Common Loon population with high mercury levels has a reduced
   growth rate (lambda=1.0005), compared to Common Loons with low body
   burdens of mercury (lambda=1.026). The results of this project will
   assist in the continued refinement of State and Federal policies and
   regulations that effectively address the ecological impacts mercury and
   other environmental contaminants pose to freshwater ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow-billed Loon (Gavia adamsii) is one of the rarest breeding
   birds in North America. Because of the small population size and patchy
   distribution, any stressor to its population is of concern. To determine
   risks posed by environmental mercury (Hg) loads, we captured 115
   Yellow-billed Loons between 2002 and 2012 in the North American Arctic
   and sampled their blood and/or feather tissues and collected nine eggs.
   Museum samples from Yellow-billed Loons also were analyzed to examine
   potential changes in Hg exposure over time. An extensive database of
   published Hg concentrations and associated adverse effects in Common
   Loons (G. immer) is highly informative and representative for
   Yellow-billed Loons. Blood Hg concentrations reflect dietary uptake of
   methylmercury (MeHg) from breeding areas and are generally considered
   near background levels if less than 1.0 mu g/g wet weight (ww). Feather
   (grown at wintering sites) and egg Hg concentrations can represent a mix
   of breeding and wintering dietary uptake of MeHg. Based on Common Loon
   studies, significant risk of reduced reproductive success generally
   occurs when adult Hg concentrations exceed 2.0 mu g/g ww in blood, 20.0
   mu g/g fresh weight (fw) in flight feathers and 1.0 mu g/g ww in eggs.
   Contemporary mercury concentrations for 176 total samples (across all
   study sites for 115 Yellow-billed Loons) ranged from 0.08 to 1.45 mu g/g
   ww in blood, 3.0 to 24.9 mu g/g fw in feathers and 0.21 to 1.23 mu g/g
   ww in eggs. Mercury concentrations in blood, feather and egg tissues
   indicate that some individual Yellow-billed Loons in breeding
   populations across North America are at risk of lowered productivity
   resulting from Hg exposure. Most Yellow-billed Loons breeding in Alaska
   overwinter in marine waters of eastern Asia. Although blood Hg
   concentrations from most breeding loons in Alaska are within background
   levels, some individuals exhibit elevated feather and egg Hg
   concentrations, which likely indicate the uptake of MeHg originating
   from eastern Asia. Feather Hg concentrations tended to be highest in
   individuals overwintering farthest west (closer to Asia). A
   retrospective analysis of museum specimens (n=25) found a two-fold
   increase in Yellow-billed Loon feather Hg concentrations from the
   pre-1920s (as early as 1845) to the present. The projected increase in
   Hg deposition (approximately four-fold by 2050) along with the
   uncertainty of Hg being released through the thawing of permafrost and
   Arctic sea ice suggest that Hg body burdens in Yellow-billed Loons may
   increase. These findings indicate that Hg is a current and potentially
   increasing environmental stressor for the Yellow-billed Loon and
   possibly other Nearctic-Palearctic migrant birds.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental changes in estuaries resulting from resource use and
   management actions can detrimentally affect waterbirds. This study
   examined the distribution and abundance of 54 waterbird species from
   1992 to 2010 in six intensively used and managed estuarine waterbodies,
   relative to four environmental variables (salinity, turbidity, depth
   variability and submerged macrophyte biomass) undergoing periodic and
   directional changes. Multivariate analyses enabled distinctions to be
   made between waterbirds associated with environmental conditions
   characteristic of either estuaries or estuarine lakes, and revealed
   spatial and temporal differences in waterbird abundances between and
   within waterbodies. Ducks and grebes were more abundant in low salinity
   deeper waterbodies, while waders, cormorants and gulls were more
   abundant in high salinity shallow waterbodies. Higher quantity and
   quality of food sources attract herbivorous waterbirds to saline lakes
   rather than estuaries. Water depth variability influences accessibility
   of feeding areas, with decreased variability in water levels increasing
   habitat suitability for herbivores, and reduced open periods in the
   estuaries decreasing habitat suitability for waders. Turbidity did not
   significantly influence the distribution of waterbirds, whereas
   disturbance from human activities and vegetation of sandbanks were
   considered to be important factors. The estuarine lakes systems provide
   a mosaic of different habitat conditions, essential for maintaining a
   diverse waterbird community.}},

Abstract = {{Wading bird prey populations, prey availability and wading bird nesting
   success are all thought to be associated with hydrologic conditions in
   wetlands, but the relationship between successful nesting and essential
   prey types fed to chicks is poorly understood in many cases. Prey fed to
   White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) chicks were quantified and compared for
   three colonies in the northern Everglades within and between the 2008
   and 2009 nesting seasons. Crayfish were the dominant prey type in both
   years, being present in 58-88\% of chick boluses across all collections.
   Prey composition was not temporally variable within 2008, but chick diet
   shifted slightly toward more fish at the end of 2009 when the wetland
   was at its driest. Crayfish were the dominant (55-65\%) energetic
   component of White Ibis chick diets in the northern Everglades during
   both a good nesting year (6,000 nests) with higher water levels (2008)
   and during an excellent nesting year (9,300 nests) when water levels
   were lower (2009). The results from this study and an earlier study
   suggest fish, along with terrestrial insects and urban refuse are only
   secondary prey for nesting White Ibis and that wetlands with abundant
   crayfish populations should promote high nesting effort.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1970s, artificially stabilized water levels, increased
   presence of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and invasion by a cattail
   hybrid (Typha x glauca) have changed the nesting environment for Western
   Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) at Delta Marsh, Manitoba. To evaluate
   the impact of these changes, nest survival rates, causes of nest
   mortality, wind conditions, locations of nests and vegetation structure
   at nests in 2009-2010, and chick-adult ratios were compared to similar
   data for Western Grebes at Delta Marsh from 1973-1974. Apparent nest
   survival rates were lower in 2009-2010 than 1973-1974, and between
   low-water years (1973, 2010) and high-water years (1974, 2009). Lower
   apparent nest survival rates in 2009-2010 (49\% in 2009 and 43\% in
   2010, compared to 46\% in 1973 and 84\% in 1974), and chick-adult ratios
   (0.55 in 1973 and 0.88 in 1974, compared to 0.55 in 2009 and 0.39 in
   2010) were attributed to increases in destruction of nests primarily by
   wave action and secondarily by common carp, which were not observed
   destroying Western Grebe nests in 1973-1974. The replacement of native
   bulrushes by cattails in Western Grebe nesting habitat may have caused
   the observed increase in proximity to open-water edge, and this
   proximity may have increased destruction of nests by waves. Restoring
   stands of emergent bulrush by varying marsh water levels and reducing
   carp in the marsh might improve nest survival of Western Grebes.}},

Abstract = {{The endangered Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) is endemic to
   the main Hawaiian Islands where it nests in underground burrows
   surrounded by vegetation that varies greatly from island to island.
   Information regarding island-specific nest site selection and habitat
   characteristics is important when considering the management needs of
   the species, including control of invasive plants and protection from
   introduced predators. Extensive search efforts, using nocturnal
   vocalization and visual surveys, resulted in locating 71 nesting burrows
   on the Island of Lana'i. Logistic regression was used to examine the
   influence of elevation, planar curvature, percent slope, canopy cover,
   and vegetation type on nest site locations. The top model in predicting
   Hawaiian Petrel nest site selection was influenced by increasing slopes,
   an understory dominated by native vegetation, and open canopy. The top
   model was supported by a model weight (w(1)) of 0.53, with the second
   model holding most of the remaining weight (w(1) = 0.19) and including
   elevation as a predictor. Native understory vegetation, dominated by
   Uluhe ferns (Dicranopteris linearis and Diplopterygium pinnatum), may
   provide some protection from introduced mammalian predators. Using high
   resolution imagery and remote sensing techniques, we quantified the
   remaining native vegetation on Lana'i. With less than 300 ha of upper
   elevation (> 600 m) native forest remaining, management priority should
   focus on reducing the spread of invasive vegetation that is quickly
   dominating nearby Hawaiian Petrel nest sites.}},

Abstract = {{With global loss of natural wetlands, managed wetlands increasingly
   support energy requirements for wintering shorebirds and waterfowl.
   Despite numerous studies of avian bioenergetics in freshwater systems,
   less is known of the energetic capacity of estuarine systems. In San
   Francisco Bay, managed saline ponds converted from former commercial
   salt evaporation ponds form part of the largest wetland restoration
   project on the Pacific coast of North America. A daily-ration model was
   applied to assess carrying capacity for diving ducks and shorebirds
   during four winter seasons (2007-2010) in seasonal and circulation
   ponds, each in two salinity classes. Diving ducks comprised an estimated
   35,450 +/- 1,559 ((x) over bar +/- SE) in average years and 45,458 +/-
   1,653 in peak years with > 95\% in circulation ponds. Shorebirds
   comprised 64,253 +/- 14,838 ((x) over bar +/- SE) in average years and
   108,171 +/- 4,854 in peak years with > 64\% in seasonal ponds.
   Macroinvertebrate energy density was highest in mesohaline (5-30 ppt)
   circulation ponds and lowest in seasonal ponds for both guilds. Energy
   requirements for diving ducks in mesohaline followed by low-hyperhaline
   (30-80 ppt) circulation ponds were mostly met by available prey energy.
   Available energy for shorebirds was substantially less than they
   required in seasonal ponds but exceeded their needs in mesohaline
   circulation ponds. Mesohaline circulation ponds supported 9,443 +/-
   1,649 ((x) over bar +/- SE) shorebird use-days.he of accessible habitat
   and 2,297 +/- 402 diving duck use-days.ha(-1) of accessible habitat,
   twice the capacity of low-hyperhaline circulation ponds and greater than
   five times that of seasonal ponds for both guilds. Our results indicated
   that reducing salinity to mesohaline levels and altering water depth to
   increase accessibility substantially increased energy available for
   these species in estuarine managed ponds.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its secretive nature and nocturnal vocalization, multi-species
   bird monitoring programs are not effective in surveying populations of
   Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) and, thus, species-specific
   survey methods should be used. To determine how to optimize nocturnal
   call-playback surveys of Yellow Rails, we evaluated the effects of
   survey methods (naive-estimated vs. detectability-adjusted estimated
   occupancy, observer, number of surveys, and the use of playbacks) and
   temporal and environmental conditions (e.g., time, date, temperature,
   moon phase, seasonality, and cloud cover) on detection probability. In
   2010 and 2011, 334 call-broadcast night surveys for Yellow Rail were
   conducted at 167 survey points within 80 wetlands in south-central
   Manitoba, Canada. Yellow Rail detection probability was estimated at
   0.63 in both years. In 2010, the detectability-adjusted wetland
   occupancy rate was estimated at 0.63, and in 2011 it was estimated at
   0.36. Call-broadcast surveys contributed relatively little to improving
   Yellow Rail detectability, but repeat surveys at each site increased the
   number of individuals detected. Detection probability was not correlated
   with the temporal or environmental variables we studied, or by observer.
   Surveys where call-broadcasts are not feasible, such as volunteer
   surveys, are still likely to result in good estimates of Yellow Rail
   abundances, if surveys are repeated within breeding seasons.}},

Abstract = {{The Olrog's Gull (Lents atlanticus) is a species that feeds almost
   exclusively on intertidal crabs. The influence of feeding technique,
   food source, and habitat characteristics on the feeding rate of breeding
   individuals was examined at Bahia San Bias, Argentina, from September to
   December 2007. Olrog's Gulls used four feeding techniques, with more
   prey captured by pecking than by peck-digging, head submergence, or
   up-ending. Olrog's Gulls fed throughout the tidal cycle using different
   intertidal zones when they were exposed and covered by water. However,
   feeding techniques used in exposed intertidal areas (pecking and
   peck-digging) resulted in significantly higher feeding rates. Feeding
   rate increased with average prey density and was higher when feeding in
   structured environments, characterized by the presence of rocks or
   oysters and high densities of the intertidal crab Cyrtograpsus
   altimanus. The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata is the main component
   of the Olrog's Gull diet during most of the breeding cycle. Although
   average density of N. granulata in feeding patches was lower than that
   of C. altimanus, body size of the former was significantly larger and
   energy density of individuals higher, resulting in a higher energy
   profitability of unstructured habitats. Prey switching toward C.
   altimanus during the young chick stage observed in previous studies may
   result from the need to feed chicks with smaller prey.}},

Abstract = {{White-headed Steamer-Ducks (Tachyeres leucocephalus) are flightless
   waterfowl endemic to a small section of coastline in Patagonia,
   Argentina. This study provides the first detailed information on
   White-headed Steamer-Duck diet composition, foraging behavior and prey
   availability. This study was conducted in the northern San Jorge Gulf,
   Patagonia, during 2007. Fifteen feeding territories were identified, and
   food availability was quantified within them and also within unused
   areas. A total of 45 feces were analyzed to determine diet composition,
   and foraging behaviors of females were monitored. Benthic community
   diversity differed between territories and non-territories. Overall,
   diversity and invertebrate abundance tended to be higher in territories.
   Ten invertebrate prey taxa were identified in adult diets, and the most
   frequent prey in feces were crabs, mussels, and ragworms. Head-neck
   dipping was the most common method of feeding. Our results improve the
   understanding of the relationship between diet, selection of areas with
   special invertebrate availability and foraging techniques used to access
   and exploit the resources.}},

Abstract = {{Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis) wintering at Dashanbao Nature
   Reserve in southwestern China were studied to document for the effects
   of flock size and position on the level of vigilance. The time spent on
   vigilance, scanning frequency and scanning duration decreased
   significantly with flock size for individuals positioned both in the
   center of the flock and at its periphery. However, the decrease in time
   spent on vigilance and scanning frequency following the increase in the
   flock size happened more rapidly for individuals in the center of the
   flock than those at the periphery. The decrease of the three parameters
   related to flock size significantly correlated with position. The time
   spent on vigilance and scanning frequency significantly correlated with
   the flock size and position, but not with scanning duration.
   Consequently, the number of individuals preferring central positions in
   the flock (a phenomenon known as ``edge effect{''}) was increased by the
   increase in flock size for Black-necked Cranes in winter.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) foraging locations in
   northern Lake Michigan were recorded in 2003 and 2010. In the interim,
   the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) appeared in 2006, and
   control of Double-crested Cormorants was initiated in 2007. Spatial data
   from 2003 and 2010 were analyzed to determine whether foraging
   distributions differed between sample periods. A multi-response
   permutation procedure found that a significant shift in foraging
   locations occurred between sample periods. Groups of Double-crested
   Cormorants foraged in the same key locations in both years, but foraging
   range expanded overall in 2010. Range expansion could be a response to
   the presence of the round goby, which is an abundant food source
   throughout Lake Michigan. The 2010 foraging location data corresponded
   with the early departure of Double-crested Cormorants from the Beaver
   Archipelago. The combined effects of control and the appearance of round
   goby in diets resulted in changes in numbers and distributions of
   foraging Double-crested Cormorants.}},

   Mallaha wetland, in Tripoli, Libya, two dead ducklings were found that
   were later genetically identified as Marbled Duck. This breeding
   evidence suggests that this and other duck species may breed elsewhere
   in Libya. Better knowledge on Libyan, and more generally on north
   African, waterbirds is needed to document the population size and the

Abstract = {{Restoration and the creation of artificial wetlands can mitigate the
   loss and degradation of natural wetlands. The chief wetland areas in
   northern Iberia are the estuaries situated along the coast of the Bay of
   Biscay. These areas are tidal in nature and often small in size. These
   characteristics, together with high levels of human, disturbance can
   cause significant limits on the conservation of waterbirds. At the end
   of 2009, an old polder within the Urdaibai marshes in Spain was modified
   to create an artificial lagoon (Orueta Lagoon). The goal of this study
   was to evaluate the use of this lagoon by waterbirds, and its
   contribution to waterbird assemblage and richness at Urdaibai. Orueta
   Lagoon contributed 26.8\% of total abundance, including 11 species not
   present in other zones of Urdaibai. Thus, it provided a new and
   attractive habitat for several waterbird species, especially ducks,
   coots and allies, shorebirds and grebes. Therefore, Orueta Lagoon plays
   a fundamental role in the enrichment of the waterbird assemblage at
   Urdaibai and hence is of great value from a conservation standpoint.}},

Title = {{Effect of Food Supply on Foraging Patterns and Body Weights of Long-toed

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Multiple species of shorebirds are now globally threatened, particularly
   across tropical Asia, yet we know relatively little of the detailed
   habitat usage and resource characteristics of sites in the region. The
   objective of this study was to determine how seasonal variation in food
   density affected foraging patterns and body weights of Long-toed Stint
   (Calidris subminuta), a relatively common winter visitor. Research was
   conducted during the passage and overwintering seasons in wastewater
   treatment ponds and salt-pans on the Inner Gulf of Thailand. Predictions
   were that during periods of higher food density, shorebirds should be
   relatively more abundant and heavier, and have increased foraging
   attempts, reduced step rates and reduced chase rates. Furthermore,
   adults were expected to have higher weights than juveniles. Overall,
   shorebird abundance was significantly positively correlated with
   invertebrate abundance during the 2-year study period. Long-toed Stints
   had greater body mass following their arrival in July-September,
   compared with later periods during the winter. Although food density and
   Long-toed Stint step rate were not significantly correlated, the data
   were consistent with previous studies suggesting a negative
   relationship. Step rates in salt-pans were significantly higher than in
   the wastewater treatment ponds, probably reflecting lower food densities
   in the salt-pans. There was no clear relationship between food density
   and Long-toed Stint peck rate, perhaps reflecting the weak correlation
   between number of pecks and the number of successful foraging bouts as
   well as limited sample sizes for prey estimates. There was no
   significant relationship between food density and chase rates. There was
   no significant difference in median body mass between adults and
   juveniles/first-year birds, implying young birds learn to forage as
   efficiently as adults relatively rapidly. This study suggests that
   further work on invertebrate dynamics and shorebird diets in the region
   is needed in order to build more predictive models of shorebird site
   usage and population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Activity patterns of fledgling storks (Ciconiidae) during the
   parental-dependency period are poorly understood for many species,
   including the Wood Stork (Mycteria americana). Satellite telemetry was
   used to track the movements of fledgling Wood Storks (n = 50) from the
   time they attained minimum flight capabilities until dispersal from the
   natal colony. Distances traveled, range size, and habitat use by
   fledgling Wood Storks were quantified for early (prior to the final week
   before dispersal) and late (the final week before dispersal)
   predispersal periods and for the entire predispersal period as a whole.
   Metrics were compared among three colonies and between two years at a
   single colony using nonparametric tests. For the entire predispersal
   period, the mean daily maximum distance of juvenile Wood Storks from
   their nest was 1.39 +/- 0.2 km (median = 0.18 and maximum = 103.13) and
   the mean cumulative distance moved per day was 2.38 +/- 0.28 km (median
   = 0.45 and maximum = 110.58). Movement distances differed among colonies
   and between years, while core and total ranges were similar regardless
   of location. The majority of locations (84\%) occurred within colony
   boundaries, 95\% occurred within 1.0 km of the colony and 98\% occurred
   within 3.5 km of the colony. Flight distances did not increase linearly
   with time and instead followed a Poisson distribution, increasing
   sharply during the final week before dispersal. Habitat management
   recommendations for juvenile Wood Storks are to preserve wetland
   features within a 1.0-3.5 km zone around a colony.}},

Abstract = {{Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa) do not present obvious sexual dimorphism,
   although females are known to be slightly larger than males, on average.
   During the nonbreeding seasons between August 2007 and April 2009, a
   noninvasive technique was tested that might permit phenotypic
   identification of sex in a large sample of individuals from the most
   important wintering area, Guerrero Negro, Mexico. Blood samples (n =
   577) were used for molecular sexing. For phenotypic sexing, culmen
   length was selected because it had the greatest sexual dimorphism. A
   normal distribution curve for culmen length of each sex and the
   overlapping area between the two curves was calculated and used to
   minimize the probability of error in identifying the sex of each
   individual. Using the criterion that males had a culmen length <= 106 mm
   and females >= 108 mm, the sex of 96.4\% of the individuals would be
   correctly identified, 2.8\% would be regarded as indeterminate and 0.8\%
   would be sexed erroneously. A discriminant analysis using bill length
   and other commonly used phenotypic measurements did not improve success
   in predicting sex. The results indicate that culmen length is a useful
   measure for sex determination in Marbled Godwit. Identification of the
   sex of Marbled Godwits in the field offers new possibilities to study
   life histories of both sexes. In Guerrero Negro, the sex ratio of
   Marbled Godwits was heavily male-biased biased (2:1), suggesting
   latitudinal segregation by sex.}},

Abstract = {{Species that undergo simultaneous flight-feather molt are susceptible to
   mortality during the flights less period. Remigial molt was examined in
   non-breeding Western Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentals) and Clark's
   Grebes (A. clarkii) using beachcast carcasses from California to
   Washington to determine where and when molt occurs and help identify
   regions of maximum risk. Molt occurred in 18\% of individuals and in all
   age classes and months examined, including winter, not previously
   recognized as a significant period for Western and Clark's grebe molt.
   Molt was encountered in all regions, with the highest proportions in
   Oregon/Washington during fall (35\%), and central (18\%) and southern
   (17\%) California during winter. The percentage of Western and Clark's
   grebes in molt collected during the first 3 days of an oil spill was
   greater than later in the response (27\% vs. 12\%), suggesting a greater
   vulnerability to oiling during this part of their life cycle. Oil spills
   and other mortality events can provide insights into avian biology not
   otherwise available, and knowledge of molting regions can minimize
   wildlife impacts of spills through prevention and response.}},

Abstract = {{Seabird movements during foraging trips and their preference for
   particular areas have recently been the focus of many studies aimed at
   gaining a better understanding of the ecological requirements of several
   species. During the last decade, the use of new devices, such as Global
   Positioning System (GPS) devices and geo-locator loggers, has allowed
   researchers to perform more investigations of this type. GPS devices
   were used on Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) breeding on
   Aride Island, Seychelles, to identify the main foraging areas used
   during early chick-rearing and to assess at-sea foraging habitat
   selection. Thirteen foraging trips were recorded, 61.5\% of which lasted
   1 day. One main foraging area, located approximately 100 km east of the
   colony just outside a granitic bank characterized by upwelling and
   higher values of primary production compared to surrounding areas, was
   identified. The foraging area size (3,313 km(2)) was much smaller than
   that identified during late chick-rearing (160,000 km(2)) in a previous
   study. This is probably due to the exigency to feed chicks more
   regularly and hence to find foraging areas closer to the colony during
   the early chick-rearing. The identification of key marine conservation
   areas, like those identified in this study, is a priority for
   designating marine Important Bird Areas and identifying habitat
   management measures. The results of this study should be relevant for
   the development of conservation plans for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and
   for other seabirds in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism is the phenotypic difference between males and females
   of the same species, characterized by different body size and plumage.
   Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger, n = 44 adults, n = 14 juveniles) were
   captured between December 2010 and April 2012 with mist nets during the
   non-breeding period in the Lagoa do Peixe estuary, southern Brazil.
   Black Skimmers showed conspicuous sexual size dimorphism, with males
   being significantly larger than females. Males were 29\% heavier than
   females and significantly larger in six measurements (\% sexual size
   dimorphism = 7-26\%). We developed two discriminant functions, both
   correctly identifying the sex of > 97.7\% of the individuals tested and
   found that head + bill length alone was sufficient to predict the adult
   sex. The preferred habitat of Black Skimmers in this area was the barra
   region of the Lagoa do Peixe, where they can take advantage of the
   abundance of fish in the shallow water. Active molt was recorded in
   62.5\% of captured Black Skimmers. The molt scores of the primaries and
   the capture date showed a positive correlation, with lower scores
   observed in November/December and the highest scores in March/April. We
   found the intensity of red coloration of the culmen was not a good
   method for Black Skimmer sex determination in the field compared to
   molecular sexing, misclassifying 31.0\% of individuals overall.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes the breeding biology of Crab Plovers (Dramas
   ardeola), a little-known shorebird species nesting on Nakhilu and
   Omol-Karam Islands located in the Nakhilu Marine National Park in the
   northern Persian Gulf, Iran. This study occurred during the breeding
   seasons of 2009-2011. Colonies had between 500-1,500 nests and were
   located on sand banks 1-3 m higher than the surrounding ground in
   non-overlapping areas. Burrow digging began in mid-April, and single
   nests were built in 2.82 +/- 0.1 days (Range = 2-4 days, n = 45) in a
   period of 10.5 +/- 0.76 days (Range = 8-13 days, n = 6), although a
   spread of digging and laying of 87.50 +/- 2.96 days (Range = 82-94 days,
   n = 4) was recorded primarily due to renesting after human damage to the
   burrows. Range in nest densities was 0.14-0.26 nest per m(2). The clutch
   size was 1.01 +/- 0.005 (Range = 1-2, n = 421). Egg size (n = 47) was
   64.05 x 44.04 mm with an average incubation period of 33 days (Range =
   31-35, n = 21). Hatching success was 63-81\%, with failures primarily
   due to egg collecting by local fishermen and tourists. An estimated of 7
   weeks passed between hatching and fledging. Fledglings had almost fully
   developed wings (83\% of adult wing length) and feathers, but very low
   weight (about 55\% of adult weight) and smaller bill length (only 60\%
   of adult bill length). A stronger control of visitors and local
   fishermen would benefit the breeding population of Crab Plovers on the
   islands.}},

Abstract = {{Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus) are a reliable indicator of overall
   habitat quality and are considered an umbrella species for reed bed
   habitat (Phragmites australis). Two methods of acoustic monitoring of
   Water Rails were tested. Ten observation points situated 100 m from each
   other inside a large reed bed were selected for acoustic monitoring.
   Observations were conducted in three sessions (end of April, June and
   September 2010) for three times a day, during 3 consecutive days. The
   number of individuals calling was quantified during spontaneous vocal
   activity for 5 min and then the number of Water Rails calling after
   exposure to digital playbacks of male and female territorial and
   courtship calls for 30 sec were recorded. To calibrate the data, all
   Water Rail nests within 100 m around three observation points were
   located. The number of nests found during the nest searches corresponded
   to the number of pairs estimated during spontaneous vocal activity, but
   was 63\% larger than the number estimated after playback. A
   statistically significant difference was found between the number of
   calls recorded at different times in session 1; however, no significant
   differences were found between sessions 2 and 3. The highest numbers of
   individuals were recorded in the morning in session 1. The difference
   was statistically significant between morning and noon (P = 0.002), but
   not between morning and evening (P = 0.289). Population evaluation and
   monitoring of Water Rails in large reed beds should be done in the
   morning, during the breeding season, using point surveys and listening
   for 5 min for spontaneous vocalizations. This method can be used both
   for quantifying and monitoring populations of Water Rails and for
   evaluating the quality of its habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of Yellow-billed Terns (Sternula
   superciliaris), Large-billed Terns (Phaetusa simplex) and Black Skimmers
   (Rynchops niger) were estimated, and the effects of habitat features on
   site occupancy by colonies of these three species nesting in the
   Anavilhanas Archipelago, Amazonas, Brazil, were examined. Individuals
   were recorded on beaches during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons, with
   26 (2008) and 30 (2009) potential nesting beaches (sites) surveyed. In
   both years, one site included 28\% of all the Yellow-billed Terns, while
   two sites included 65\% of all the Large-billed Terns. Site occupancy,
   the probability that a site is occupied (range Psi), was moderate to low
   for all three species, but higher for Yellow-billed Terns (0.58-0.63)
   than for Large-billed Terns (0.40-0.50) and Black Skimmers (0.23-0.54).
   Yellow-billed and Large-billed terns and Black Skimmers generally nested
   on larger beaches on islands that had little vegetative cover and that
   were exposed to open water, remote from river margins, distant from
   other islands and closer to large colonies of the same species.
   Abundance estimates (individuals per breeding season in the archipelago
   SE) in 2009 varied considerably among species (Yellow-billed Terns: 192
   individuals +/- 1; Large-billed Terns: 80 +/- 1; Black Skimmer: 31 +/-
   1). These results suggest that habitat features that influence breeding
   site use by Yellow-billed and Large-billed terns and Black Skimmers
   include physical and vegetation characteristics as well as social
   attraction. While the probability of site occupancy increased with
   measures related to beach size and geographical isolation, closeness to
   large colonies indicates the relevance of social interactions for these
   species and, as such, the importance of large areas for the occurrence
   of their colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed information on bird populations and wetland habitats is highly
   important for future conservation and management activities. More than
   50\% of natural wetland habitats have been lost or degraded due to human
   intervention, which has negatively affected wetland-dependent bird
   populations. In this study, the density, diversity and feeding guilds of
   various bird species in an artificial wetland habitat were examined
   using a distance sampling point count technique. A total of 20,010
   individuals of 102 species representing 40 families were detected from
   March 2009 to June 2010. In all, 64 species were counted with 72.5\% of
   14,520 individuals residents, 22 species were counted with 26.4\% of
   5,290 individuals resident-migrants, 13 species were counted with 1.0\%
   of 196 individuals migrants and three species were counted with 0.1\% of
   four individuals counted vagrants. Resident birds were present at the
   highest density and vagrants at the lowest. The most dominant migrant,
   resident and resident-migrant species were the Oriental Reed Warbler
   (Acrocephalus orientalis) (0.37 +/- 0.10 birds ha(-1)), Rock Pigeon
   (Columba livia) (3.91 + 0.97 birds ha(-1)) and Purple Heron (Ardea
   purpurea) (1.55 +/- 0.93 birds ha(-1)), respectively. The community
   structure of resident birds was the most diverse and rich compared to
   migrants, resident-migrants and vagrants. Frugivore/insectivore (1.04
   +/- 0.20 birds ha(-1)) was the most dominant feeding guild for migrants,
   nectarivore/insectivore (0.64 +/- 0.04 birds ha(-1)) for residents and
   omnivore (0.28 +/- 0.03 birds ha(-1)) for resident-migrants. The
   findings of this research indicate that artificial wetlands can provide
   an alternative habitat for the foraging and breeding activities of
   different bird assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about movements and habitat use of Brown Pelicans
   (Pelecanus occidentalis) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We attached
   satellite transmitters to 18 adult Brown Pelicans (nine males, nine
   females) that were captured on Grand Isle along the Louisiana coast
   during 31 August-2 September 2010. Their movements and habitat use were
   tracked between September 2010 and March 2012. Nine of the Brown
   Pelicans remained proximate to the Louisiana coast; four ranged along
   the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; three moved from
   Louisiana to Texas; and two migrated across the Gulf of Mexico to the
   Yucatan Peninsula. Annual 99\% home range estimates varied widely ((x)
   over bar = 10,611 km(2), SE = 2,370), and males had larger ranges ((x)
   over bar = 15,088 km(2), SE = 2,219) than females ((x) over bar = 6,133
   km(2), SE = 1,764). Habitats used by Brown Pelicans were primarily open
   water, estuarine emergent wetland, grassland, unconsolidated shore, and
   deep water habitat types.}},

Abstract = {{The Long-billed Murrelet (Brachyramphus perdix) was previously
   considered to breed in Hokkaido, Japan, but the single 1961 historical
   nest record was recently found to be invalid, and small numbers observed
   during at-sea surveys off northeastern Hokkaido in 1996-2001 did not
   suggest breeding. In the Iburi Region of southern Hokkaido, small
   numbers of Long-billed Murrelets were observed at sea in May 2010 (n =
   8) and May 2011 (n = 4), reflecting either local breeding, a stopover
   site during migration, or non-breeding individuals south of the breeding
   range during the breeding season. Single Long-billed Murrelets also were
   observed in October and December 2011, representing movements after the
   pre-basic molt. A historical record of a juvenile found in the forest
   about 20 km inland near the Chitose River in either 1913 or 1915
   provides evidence of historical breeding in the Iburi Region and the
   best evidence so far of breeding in Japan, although breeding also may
   occur in the nearby southern Kuril Islands. At-sea and forest surveys
   are needed to better establish the status of and help conserve this
   declining species in the Iburi Region and other parts of Hokkaido.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary (Sanctuary) at the
   Cruces River, Chile, has undergone important ecosystem changes.
   Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa), the main food resource of
   Black-necked Swans (Cygnus melancoryphus), has greatly decreased in
   abundance. This disappearance may have affected the abundance of
   Black-necked Swans within the Sanctuary; however, the variation in the
   Black-necked Swan population is still poorly understood. Spatiotemporal
   variation in population abundance and feeding/breeding ecology of
   Black-necked Swans was analyzed in the Sanctuary and adjacent wetlands
   (non-protected areas outside the Sanctuary) from 2000 to 2010. Temporal
   fluctuations in Black-necked Swan abundance were recorded, with
   increases in population size from late December to early June and
   decreases from late June to late September. Five main feeding grounds
   that were devoid of Brazilian waterweed were identified. However,
   several other aquatic plants were recorded on these grounds, suggesting
   that these areas provide alternative food resources for Black-necked
   Swans. Changes in the reproductive timing of Black-necked Swans
   throughout the 10-year study were recorded; no reproductive events
   occurred between 2004 and 2006, and a shortened reproductive period
   occurred between 2006 and 2010. In addition, there were changes in the
   locations of the breeding grounds as well as in the number of nests and
   chicks recorded during the study period. These results revealed new
   patterns in Black-necked Swan population trends as well as their
   distribution in areas both inside and outside the Sanctuary. Thus, to
   ensure effective conservation of this species requires the integration
   of protected areas within as well as non-protected areas outside the
   Sanctuary.}},

Abstract = {{This study documents patterns of primary feather molt and body mass
   changes in Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) and Western Sandpipers
   (C. mauri) in Ensenada de La Paz, Mexico. Both species use the same
   habitats and complete an uninterrupted primary feather molt between late
   July and October. Average timing of Least Sandpiper primary molt was
   from 29 July to 21 September (duration of 54 days), while Western
   Sandpipers molted from 29 July to 29 September (duration of 62 days).
   Molt models of individual primaries suggested that the molt of Least
   Sandpipers starts after all individuals have arrived in the study area,
   whereas the molt of Western Sandpiper starts before all individuals have
   arrived; the heavier Western Sandpiper tends to grow more feathers
   simultaneously than the Least Sandpiper. While Western Sandpipers are
   heavier than Least Sandpipers at the start of molt, both species
   decrease their body mass over the molt period. Although Least and
   Western sandpipers have similar natural histories, they show different
   primary molt patterns in Baja California Sur. Received 12 August 2012,
   accepted 8 March 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The millions of wetlands that define the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR)
   harbor large proportions of continental populations of several species
   of North American waterfowl, waterbirds, and shorebirds. The PPR also
   has some of the highest wind energy potential in the United States.
   Thousands of wind turbines are being erected in the PPR to produce
   electricity and have the potential to affect migratory bird populations
   through collisions, displacement, barriers to movement, habitat
   fragmentation, and habitat loss. We assessed occurrence of waterbirds
   and shorebirds from 2008 through 2010 on wetlands in two wind energy
   development sites, defined as wetlands within 805 m of a wind turbine,
   and two reference sites in the PPR of North and South Dakota. We
   conducted 10,321 wetland visits on 3,542 individual wetland basins and
   related bird occurrence to wetland characteristics, upland
   characteristics, survey type (roadside vs. off-road), seasonal timing of
   sampling, year of sampling, and site type (wind energy development vs.
   reference). Models characterizing occurrence of Willet (Catoptrophorus
   semipalmatus), Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), Wilson's Phalarope
   (Phalaropus tricolor) and Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) indicated that
   occurrence varied with wetland characteristics and among sites and
   years, was not substantially reduced on either wind energy site, but was
   slightly and consistently lower on one of the wind energy sites for the
   three shorebird species. Our results suggest that wetlands have
   conservation value for these species when wind turbines are present, but
   additional sampling across time and space will be necessary to
   understand the effects of wind turbines on shorebird and waterbird
   presence, density, survival, and reproductive success. Received 24 July
   2012, accepted 23 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Mauritanian Spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia balsaci) only breed at Banc
   d'Arguin, Mauritania, West Africa. Their populations have declined;
   however, nothing is known about possible ecological factors involved,
   including their primary food and foraging habits. Home range sizes,
   habitat selection, and foraging rhythm in six adult Mauritanian
   Spoonbills were documented by attaching backpack harnesses with
   solar-powered satellite GPS-transmitters. Based on 18 bird-months of
   data (5,844 selected ground positions) collected between 2008 and 2010,
   these individuals never left the study area centered on the island of
   Tidra. The fixed kernel home range size was 23-101 km(2) ((x) over bar =
   62 km(2)) and the core area 2-14 km(2) ((x) over bar = 7 km(2)). Home
   range sizes did not differ between breeding and non-breeding seasons.
   Mauritanian Spoonbills fed only in intertidal areas where they preferred
   the seagrass-covered (Zostera noltii) areas and they fed primarily
   during the ebbing tide. Furthermore, the GPS-positions away from the
   high tide roosts were strongly associated with creeks dissecting the
   seagrass beds. During the non-breeding season, foraging occurred
   throughout the 24-hr period, but during the breeding season they foraged
   exclusively by night. Received 30 July 2012, accepted 2 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The Torrent Duck (Merganetta armata) inhabits the torrential rivers of
   the Andean mountains. As part of a long-term study, two rivers important
   for hydroelectric production were surveyed in Central Chile. Monthly
   indices of Torrent Duck abundance and reproduction were recorded at 74
   sampling points distributed along 35.4 km of river between 2007 and
   2009. Habitat variables were measured to determine the factors that
   influence species abundance. The number of rapids, gradient, total flow,
   water velocity, relative position to hydropower intakes and abundance of
   conspecifics were identified as important attributes in Torrent Duck
   habitat preferences. Torrent Ducks were observed in selected sections of
   rivers where the presence of rapids, high slopes and high water velocity
   occurred. These conditions were influenced by the width and shape of the
   river bed. Spatial segregation among individuals suggests the effect of
   territoriality. Torrent Ducks tended to avoid the presence of high
   vehicular traffic roads and sections downstream of the hydropower
   intakes. The hydropower intakes showed no impact on either the chemistry
   of the water or the composition of the macroinvertebrate community. The
   negative effects of hydroelectric power production on Torrent Duck
   populations could be mitigated through the modification of the shape of
   the river channel. Received 7 January 2012, accepted 18 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty adult male American Bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus) were marked
   on summer range in central North America with satellite tracking
   Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs) to document migration routes and
   wintering range. Nineteen complete fall migration routes were documented
   for 17 individuals. Of the successful migrations, 63\% (n = 12) went to
   southern Florida, 32\% (n = 6) to southern Louisiana, and 5\% (n = 1) to
   the Gulf coast of Texas. Spring migrations for nine birds were
   documented, and 78\% (n = 7) showed fidelity to breeding range. Two
   complete migrations for two individuals were documented, and they
   demonstrated fidelity to winter range. The longest, fastest movement
   documented was 2,300 km in less than 74 hr. Extensive, post-breeding
   dispersal was not observed in the adult male American Bitterns in this
   study. Six male American Bitterns were marked with PTTs on winter range
   in Florida and Texas. Spring migration for these birds was documented to
   Nebraska, North Dakota, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Sixty-seven
   American Bitterns were marked with Very High Frequency radio
   transmitters on summer ranges, and 16\% (n = 11) were located on
   wintering grounds used by the satellite-tracked birds, further
   documenting the importance of the Everglades and the Louisiana coast as
   winter habitat for American Bitterns that breed in Central North
   America. Received 29 October 2012, accepted 20 February 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica) are among the most widespread,
   yet scarce, Charadriiformes in the world. Two subspecies are recognized
   in the United States: G. n. aranea breeds along the U.S. Atlantic and
   Gulf coasts and G. n. vanrossemi breeds in the Salton Sea and San Diego
   Bay of California. Conservation concerns exist for the species due to
   its low abundance in the United States and apparent declines in some
   parts of its North American range. We used nuclear microsatellite
   markers and mitochondrial DNA sequences to assess genetic diversity and
   differentiation patterns among Gull-billed Tern populations from
   Virginia, Texas, and California. We also tested for evidence of
   population bottlenecks, and evaluated the support our data provide for
   the North American subspecies. Genetic diversity was highest in Texas
   and underscored the importance of habitat in that large population.
   Significant population differentiation existed, but could not be
   consistently identified using various analytical approaches and
   suggested that the magnitude of differentiation was low. No evidence for
   bottlenecks was identified. Our data could not distinguish individuals
   from different subspecies and therefore do not support the current
   intraspecific taxonomy. Tenable explanations for many findings are
   related to the low site tenacity demonstrated by the species. Received
   24 January 2013, accepted 8 April 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Animal movements and habitat selection within the home range, or
   microhabitat selection, can provide insights into habitat requirements,
   such as foraging and area requirements. The King Rail (Rallus elegans)
   is a wedand bird of high conservation concern in the United States, but
   little is known about its movements, habitats, or demography. King Rails
   (n = 34) were captured during the 2010-2011 breeding seasons in the
   coastal marshes of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. Radio
   telemetry and direct habitat surveys of King Rail locations were
   conducted to estimate home ranges and microhabitat selection. Within
   home ranges, King Rails selected for greater plant species richness and
   comparatively greater coverage of Phragmites australis, Typha spp., and
   Schoenoplectus robustus. King Rails were found closer to open water
   compared to random locations placed 50 m from King Rail locations. Home
   ranges (n = 22) varied from 0.8-32.8 ha and differed greatly among
   sites. Home range size did not vary by year or sex; however, increased
   open water, with a maximum of 29\% observed in the study, was correlated
   with smaller home ranges. Breeding season cumulative survivorship was
   89\% +/- 22\% in 2010 and 61\% +/- 43\% in 2011, which coincided with a
   drought. With an equal search effort, King Rail chicks and juveniles
   observed in May-June decreased from 110 in 2010 to only 16 in the drier
   year of 2011. The findings show King Rail used marsh with <= 29\% open
   water and had smaller home ranges when open water was more abundant.

Abstract = {{Seabirds are important bio-indicators for marine ecosystem conservation.
   Monitoring at logistically-challenging seabird colonies takes extensive
   resources and expensive man-hours to complete. The use of remote
   time-lapse photography to collect population parameters at seabird
   colonies is a novel way to reduce researcher effort while collecting
   valuable data. To illustrate the applicability of this method, data were
   collected at a Thick-billed Murre (Uria lomvia) colony on Kippaku,
   Greenland. Time-lapse photography was used to take pictures once per
   hour of a predetermined study plot for the duration of the breeding
   season, and the pictures were then analyzed using GIS software. By using
   a photo-capture interval of one picture per hour during one murre
   breeding season, the study showed a seasonal trend in attendance peaking
   in the mid chick-rearing period, a diurnal trend with a small peak at
   ca. 07:00 hr and a larger peak at ca. 19:00 hr. The study showed that
   careful choice of photo-capture interval is important to reduce the
   possibility of misrepresenting the diurnal trend of the study species.
   Compared to the 1-hr photo-capture interval, intervals of 2 and 4 hr
   accurately depicted the diurnal trend, while a 3-hr interval showed the
   trend but with a misrepresentation of the first attendance peak. A 5-hr
   interval introduced stochastic effects that did not show the correct
   diurnal trend. The proposed method can be applied to colonial breeding
   seabirds and/or other similar systems for population monitoring.
   Researcher effort and costs associated with data collection for
   population monitoring of seabird colonies can be greatly reduced and
   population estimates can be drastically improved by the use of remote
   time-lapse photography. Received 19 February 2013, accepted 30 April

Abstract = {{Barrier islands provide numerous ecosystem functions and services,
   including critical breeding habitat for many waterbird species.
   Louisiana's barrier islands are experiencing rapid land loss and habitat
   degradation. Restoration of barrier islands has become a high priority
   in Louisiana and barrier island degradation has increased waterbird
   reliance on restored dredge material islands. To improve restoration and
   management of barrier islands, we investigated the hatching success of
   Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) and determined important habitat
   characteristics for their hatching success. Nest monitoring and nest
   habitat characteristics were measured at breeding colonies on the Isles
   Dernieres Barrier Island Refuge, Louisiana, in 2009 and 2010. Hatching
   success varied greatly for Black Skimmers (1-84\%). Predation, flooding,
   and competition were the three main causes of nest failure. Habitat
   modeling identified nest elevation relative to the high-tide line and
   distance to high-tide line as important habitat characteristics.
   Continued restoration to build landmass on the islands is necessary to
   maintain quality nesting areas for Black Skimmers. Additionally, dredge
   applications to increase elevation, vegetation management, and predator
   control can provide more quality habitat and increase hatching success.

Abstract = {{Tropicbirds (order Phaethontiformes) are a well-studied seabird taxon,
   but there have been no published studies on sexual size dimorphism.
   Here, we investigated sexual size dimorphism in the Red-billed
   Tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) and the White-tailed Tropicbird (P.
   lepturus), and evaluated the applicability of using morphometrics and
   discriminant functions to sex birds in the field. We sampled Red-billed
   Tropicbirds (n = 160) and White-tailed Tropicbirds (n = 57) in the
   Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil. Each individual had seven
   morphometric traits measured and blood sampled for molecular sex
   determination. Discriminant functions were generated using generalized
   linear models (GLM). Red-billed Tropicbirds had significant male-biased
   intersexual differences in bill length, wing chord, nostril-to-bill-tip,
   and head-plus-bill, and the best GLM included bill length and wing
   chord. White-tailed Tropicbirds were characterized by significant
   intersexual differences for wing chord, with females larger than males,
   and the best GLM for this species included wing chord, bill width, and
   bill depth. Discriminant functions had accuracy similar to those used
   for other seabird species with similar body sizes. Received 16 January

Abstract = {{Recovery of endangered birds often involves population establishment
   through introduction of captive-reared individuals. Growth of a
   captive-reared Whooping Crane (Grus americana) population introduced
   into central Wisconsin is currently limited by a high rate of nest
   desertion, which is thought to possibly be related to poor general nest
   attentiveness. Whooping Crane nest attentiveness and associated
   covariates were studied. Egg infertility and embryonic death rates were
   assessed as well as their effects on daily nest survival estimates.
   Techniques to minimize predation exposure of unattended eggs were
   developed and evaluated. Most Whooping Crane pairs deserted their eggs
   and all left them unattended. Nest desertion was associated with poor
   nest attentiveness. Variables related to age of the nesting pair were
   useful for modeling nest attentiveness. Daily nest survival estimates
   based solely on adult presence potentially produced inflated measures.
   Results suggest management interventions can minimize predation exposure
   of unattended eggs. Bypassing a portion of incubation has the additional
   advantage of simultaneously addressing nest failure and maximizing
   productivity. Received 28 November 2012, accepted 8 March 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behavior of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) has been
   studied extensively because of their dramatic population decline and
   endangered status. The foraging by Wood Storks at an arribada beach with
   olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea; turtle) at Ostional,
   Costa Rica, was examined to determine their depredation behavior on
   turtle eggs and hatchlings. Wood Storks, in association with Black
   Vultures (Coragyps atratus), foraged on turtle nests exposed by stream,
   tidal, and wind erosion, and on nests dug up by dogs (Canis familiaris).
   Wood Storks also foraged on emerging turtle hatchlings and those
   crawling to the sea. Wood Storks concentrated near stream beds where
   nearly half of the predation events (eggs/hatchlings being eaten)
   occurred. Usually, one to three Wood Storks fed at a turtle nest; an
   average of 87\% of the Wood Storks that were within 5 m of a turtle nest
   obtained eggs or hatchlings. The number of Wood Storks present and
   feeding, and the percent feeding, depended upon feeding location, time
   of day, and whether they were feeding on exposed nests or on emerging
   hatchlings. An average of two Wood Storks per 30 sec obtained food at
   nests with exposed eggs, compared with four at nests with emerging
   turtle hatchlings. Most Wood Storks fed at nests exposed at stream banks
   (60\%) or by tides (23\%). Wood Storks had little effect on success of
   olive ridley sea turtles at Ostional because of the very large number of
   nesting female turtles, the small population of Wood Storks, and that
   most turtle hatchlings emerge at night when Wood Storks did not forage.
   Wood Storks were scared off by people during the peak daylight hatching
   period, and most Wood Storks and Black Vultures foraged at turtle nests
   exposed by wind, rain, tides, and dogs. The only viable olive ridley sea
   turtle offspring Wood Storks fed on were emerging hatchlings and those
   that crawled to the sea during the daylight. Received 31 January 2013,
   accepted 14 March 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Obligate marsh bird detection rates during surveys are affected by the
   time of day and the tide level, but previous research on both factors
   has produced conflicting results and no research has been conducted in
   east coast tidal marshes. Relative abundance and detection rate of
   Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris) were compared between morning and
   evening surveys at high, medium, and low tide levels in Worcester
   County, Maryland, during 2006. The detection rate of Clapper Rails was
   greatest in the morning at the medium tide level ((x) over bar= 0.69, SE
   = 0.14, F-5,F-40= 5.87, P = 0.001). Morning surveys ((x) over bar = 1.2,
   SE = 0.14) resulted in a greater relative abundance of Clapper Rail
   detections compared to evening surveys ((x) over bar = 0.8, SE = 0.12,
   F-1,F-195 = 5.31, P = 0.022), and surveys done at medium tide level ((x)
   over bar = 1.3, SE = 0.17) resulted in greater relative abundance than
   those conducted at low ((x) over bar = 0.8, SE = 0.15) or high levels
   ((x) over bar = 0.7, SE = 0.15, F-2,F-195 = 6.56, P = 0.002). The
   results suggest that surveys should be conducted in the morning at
   medium tide to maximize detection rate of Clapper Rails. The detection
   rate of obligate marsh birds during surveys is affected by time and tide
   level so additional research is necessary to determine how these
   variables affect the detection rate of marsh birds other than Clapper
   Rails. Received 29 December 2011, accepted 8 March 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the waterbird community at Lago Salso in Southern
   Italy, Apulia, was surveyed over a 4-year period (2003-2006), during the
   breeding season (May-July). Lago Salso is an artificial lake with high
   water levels. Flooding of the surrounding fields, due to copious
   seasonal rainfalls, occasionally forms vast swampy wetlands around Lago
   Salso. The variation in waterbird structure and composition,
   concomitantly with the occurrence of these flooded habitats, is
   described. In particular, during 2003-2005 there was little variation in
   annual species richness and diversity at the lake. However, in 2006 the
   waterbird community changed in species composition and significantly
   increased in species richness (from 21 +/- 3.8 to 32 +/- 2.5 species)
   and abundance values (from 222 +/- 167 to 988 +/- 42.4 individuals) with
   the presence of wet grasslands. Lago Salso is one of the most Important
   Bird Areas on the Italian peninsula, and the occurrence of several
   species with high conservation value almost exclusive to wet grassland
   has important implications from a conservation point of view. The
   formations of temporary flooded meadows are rare in the south of Italy,
   and our results emphasize the need to define management guidelines for
   the maintenance of such flooded grasslands. Received 21 November 2011,

Abstract = {{Senescence is a decline in body function with advanced age that
   manifests itself in birds as a decrease in survival rates or
   reproduction. Senescence is difficult to study in free-ranging birds
   because few birds reach old age and few studies last long enough to
   identify those birds that do. For 21 years, I studied lifelong
   reproduction among Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) nesting in New Haven
   County, Connecticut. These data were used to determine the impact of old
   age on female and male fecundity during the current year and during the
   remainder of the birds' lives. Old-aged geese were relatively common in
   this population; 15\% of recruited geese lived 10 years, 3\% lived 15
   years, and one female lived 20 years. Females that nested when they were
   between 5 and 9 years old had a mean clutch size of 4.5, brood size at
   hatching of 3.4, and brood size at fledging of 2.9. Females that nested
   when they were at least 10 years old had a mean clutch size of 4.7,
   brood size at hatching of 3.4, and brood size at fledging of 3.3. These
   variables were independent of age for both sexes. Future reproduction
   (number of future nesting years and future production of eggs,
   hatchlings, and fledglings) declined with parental age for males but not
   females. Body mass of nesting birds did not change with age for either
   males or females. These results provided evidence of an effect of
   senescence in male Canada Geese but not females. The terminal investment
   hypothesis (i.e., that parental investment should increase as birds
   become older) was not supported for either sex. Received 20 November
   2012, accepted 2 May 2013.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the interspecific fostering of two Ring-billed Gull
   chicks (Larus delawarensis) following natural adoption by a pair of
   Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) at Gull Island, Presqu'ile Provincial
   Park, Ontario, Canada, in 2011. Naturally-occurring, interspecific
   adoptions among waterbirds are rare and those between distantly-related
   species have not been confirmed to produce fledglings. The observation
   of one Ring-billed Gull chick being raised by Caspian Terns beyond
   fledging (approximately 46 days of age) appears to be the first record
   of successful adoption between different taxonomic families of
   waterbirds. Behavior, provisioning rate, and growth of chicks were
   recorded to document this adoption. During linear growth, the mass of
   the adopted Ring-billed Gull chicks were close to, or even exceeding,
   maximum mass of Ring-billed Gull chicks raised by their natural parents.
   After this period, however, the adoptive Caspian Tern parents reduced
   provisioning rates below those recorded for conspecifics and the adopted
   Ring-billed Gull chicks lost mass, one of which left the territory
   prematurely and died. Although initial circumstances leading to the
   adoption were unclear, that one Ring-billed Gull chick was ultimately
   fledged by Caspian Terns is remarkable given the different provisioning
   methods and diet of these species. Received 1 October 2012, accepted 12
   February 2013.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Hematocrits were measured in Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) (n = 75) that
   were exposed to oil from a spill in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA, in
   2003, and that laid eggs 17-39 days following the spill. Comparative
   data were obtained in three pre- and two post-spill years and from three
   unoiled reference sites. In non-spill years, annual means of hematocrit
   varied in parallel with breeding performance. Hematocrits were lower
   (mean 45.3, n = 75) and more variable in the oil spill year than in
   non-spill years, and 20\% of birds sampled were anemic (hematocrit <
   41.7). However, hematocrits were almost as low (mean 46.4, n = 44) in
   2002, a year with naturally adverse conditions. In 2002, hematocrits and
   body-masses were depressed following two storms and recovered in
   parallel following the storms; hematocrits were positively correlated
   with body-mass and ambient temperature and negatively correlated with
   wind speed. In contrast, in 2003 hematocrits were negatively correlated
   with body-mass and temperature and positively correlated with wind
   speed. Hematocrits were very low (mean 39.8, n = 15) when birds were
   first sampled 20-23 days after the spill and recovered toward normal
   levels by day 39 (mean 49.4, n = 14). Reduced hematocrits can be a
   useful indicator of sublethal oil intoxication, especially in females,
   provided that they are not associated with low body-masses or adverse
   weather. Measuring hematocrits could be useful for rapid screening of
   populations sublethally exposed to oil. Received 4 April 2011, accepted

Abstract = {{The Ibisbill (Ibidorhyncha struthersii) is a rare shorebird uniquely
   adapted to high-altitude river rapids. Ibisbill has received little
   study as a result of its isolation and the inaccessibility of its
   habitat. The habitat utilization, time budgets and daily rhythm of
   Ibisbill were studied in the southwestern part of Sichuan Province,
   China, in July to August 2008 and January to February 2010. A total of
   55 Ibisbills were recorded in summer and 87 in winter. Encounter rates
   and group size were similar in summer and winter, but habitat selection
   differed. In summer, most Ibisbills chose central islands in rivers that
   had many large stones offering opportunities for both camouflage and
   physical concealment, and riverside pasture covered by weedy growth with
   abundant insects making them suitable for foraging. In winter, when
   water levels are low and many stony beaches are exposed, Ibisbills were
   more often encountered on riverbanks. Foraging (48.9\%) and resting
   (32.3\%) were the most commonly observed behaviors, and the time that
   Ibisbills spent on foraging (t(19) = -4.0, P = 0.001) in winter was
   significantly higher than in summer. In winter, Ibisbills spent less
   time engaged in locomotion (t(19) = 5.1, P = 0.001) and resting (t(19) =
   -2.8, P = 0.012). Alertness increased toward sunset in summer but not in
   winter. Received 28 November 2011, accepted 20 December 2012.}},

Abstract = {{During winter, molluscivorous sea ducks often form high density feeding
   flocks in association with patchily distributed prey, although few
   studies have documented the substrate and prey characteristics where sea
   ducks (tribe: Mergini) aggregate and thus what constitutes high-value
   sea duck foraging habitat. Sea duck surveys were conducted and benthic
   grab samples collected at sites with different benthic substrate
   characteristics to compare macroinvertebrate community assemblages in
   relation to densities of three species of sea ducks: (Surf (Melanitta
   perspicillata), Black (M. americana), and White-winged (M. fusca)
   scoters (hereafter ``scoters{''} when combined) during winter
   (2010-2011) in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, an urbanized estuary in
   the Northwest Atlantic. Overall, the highest densities of scoters (104
   +/- 17 per 0.5 km(2)) were found over sand substrates with homogeneous
   assemblages of infaunal prey. Significantly lower densities of scoters
   (21 4 per 0.5 km(2)) were associated with mixed sand-gravel-mud
   substrates that supported epifaunal assemblages and patchily distributed
   infauna. Mean energy densities (kcal/g) were higher among infaunal
   (0.64-4.49) vs. epifaunal (0.17-0.53) prey. Overall biomass (g/m(2)) of
   polychaetes was higher in mixed substrates, and biomass of infaunal
   bivalves did not significantly differ among habitat type. However,
   infaunal prey may have been less accessible to scoters at sites with
   mixed substrates due to a barrier effect created by high-densities of
   epifauna with low energetic value. Thus, sand-substrate sites supporting
   infaunal benthic communities may provide high-quality feeding habitat
   for scoters wintering in the Northwest Atlantic. Understanding the
   influences of benthic habitat characteristics and macroinvertebrate prey
   assemblages on distribution of feeding scoters is particularly important
   for managing sea ducks in areas with increasing anthropogenic
   development in the coastal zone. Received 16 November 2012, accepted 13

Abstract = {{Nest failure has often been identified as a factor affecting American
   Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) survivorship. To examine causes of
   nest failure, small digital cameras were deployed between 6 April and 15
   July 2005 on American Oystercatcher nests on Fisherman Island National
   Wildlife Refuge located in Northampton County, Virginia. Twenty-five
   attempts, representing 22 different pairs, were recorded resulting in
   7,570 hr of video footage. Nest survivorship was 44\% (n = 11). High
   tide events associated with coastal storms were the largest source of
   nest loss (24\%, n = 6), followed by predation on eggs (16\%, n = 4).
   Nest abandonment, unknown factors, and infertile eggs accounted for the
   remaining 16\% (n = 4) of nests. The main predator was Fish Crows
   (Corvus ossifragus). While American Oystercatchers were incubating, 211
   instances were recorded where individuals of 22 species entered the
   field of view of video cameras. The most common species entering
   included Boat-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus major) (22.7\%), white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (11.4\%), Brown Pelican (Pelecanus
   occidentalis) (10.9\%), Willet (Tringa semipalmata) (9.0\%), and ghost
   crab (Ocypode quadrata) (7.1\%). A wide range of responses to intruders
   from no reaction to permanent nest abandonment were displayed by
   incubating American Oystercatchers The majority (65.9\%, n = 139) of
   encounters were met with no reaction followed by fleeing the nest area
   (17.5\%, n = 37), chasing the intruder (8.5\%, n = 18), piping (7.6\%, n
   = 16), and abandoning the nest (< 1.0\%, n = 1). All predation events
   occurred when American Oystercatchers left nests unattended. Received 14
   March 2011, accepted 23 December 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) are among the most common
   North American shore-birds. Breeding in Arctic North America, this
   species displays regional differences in migratory pathways and
   possesses longitudinal bill length variation. Previous investigations
   suggested that genetic structure may occur within Semipalmated
   Sandpipers and that three subspecies corresponding to western, central,
   and eastern breeding groups exist. In this study, mitochondrial control
   region sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci were used to analyze
   DNA of birds (microsatellites: n = 120; mtDNA: n = 114) sampled from
   seven North American locations. Analyses designed to quantify genetic
   structure and diversity patterns, evaluate genetic evidence for
   population size changes, and determine if genetic data support the
   existence of Semipalmated Sandpiper subspecies were performed. Genetic
   structure based only on the mtDNA data was observed, whereas the
   microsatellite loci provided no evidence of genetic differentiation.
   Differentiation among locations and regions reflected allele frequency
   differences rather than separate phylogenedc groups, and similar levels
   of genetic diversity were noted. Combined, the two data sets provided no
   evidence to support the existence of subspecies and were not useful for
   determining migratory connectivity between breeding sites and wintering
   grounds. Birds from western and central groups displayed signatures of
   population expansions, whereas the eastern group was more consistent
   with a stable overall population. Results of this analysis suggest that
   the eastern group was the source of individuals that colonized the
   central and western regions currently utilized by Semipalmated
   Sandpipers. Received 6 August 2012, accepted 29 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Curbing the declining trends of King Rails (Rallus elegans) that occupy
   freshwater emergent marshes requires an understanding of their ecology
   and response to management practices. King Rails were surveyed during
   the breeding season (March-June) at Back Bay and Mackay Island National
   Wildlife Refuges, Virginia and North Carolina, in 2009 and 2010.
   Twenty-two plots were surveyed in 2009 and 41 in 2010. Annual occupancy
   estimates were based on pooled data encompassing both refuges. In 2010,
   occupancy and abundance of King Rails were also estimated for each
   refuge and assessed with respect to fire management. Plots in 2010 were
   classified as recently burned (0-1 years-since-burn {[}YSB]) or >= 2
   YSB. Occupancy probability was similar between 2009 (0.68 +/- 0.14) and
   2010 (0.62 +/- 0.08). In 2010, occupancy probability was higher at
   Mackay Island (0.95 +/- 0.06) than Back Bay (0.69 +/- 0.13). Mean plot
   abundance (Mackay Island = 1.47 +/- 0.38; Back Bay = 0.66 +/- 0.22) was
   also higher. The probability of occupying 0-1 YSB plots was higher at
   both refuges (Mackay Island = 0.95 0.06; Back Bay = 0.72 +/- 0.20) when
   compared to a 2 YSB plots (Mackay Island = 0.69 0.13; Back Bay = 0.25
   +/- 0.12). Location strongly influenced occupancy of King Rails. It is
   plausible that the marsh composition (natural vs. created) accounted for
   the observed differences in occupancy. Natural marshes may provide
   higher quality habitat (e.g., resource availability) for King Rails than
   created marshes. Received 9 March 2012, accepted 11 December 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Previous theory to explain pairing behavior in waterfowl suggested that
   timing of pairing was constrained by costs to males of being paired and
   assumed that males incur most of the cost of defense after a pair bond
   is formed. An alternative hypothesis predicts that male and female
   partners will mutually defend their pair bond and that an individual
   will assume a:greater share of defense when paired to a relatively high
   than low quality partner. Behavior of wintering Harlequin Duck
   (Histrionicus histrionicus) pairs was consistent with the latter
   hypothesis. Females and males shared equally in pair-bond defense in new
   pairs involving young females, while males assumed a greater share of
   defense when paired to an older female. Overall, males performed more
   aggressive displays in defense of the pair bond than females, but
   displays by females were more frequently of higher intensity than those
   of their mate. The relative share of pair-bond defense also varied
   between females and males depending on the target of the aggressive
   display. In some pairs, females performed virtually all defensive
   displays and bore the primary cost of pair-bond defense. Even when sex
   ratios are male-biased, differences in male quality probably make
   females willing to protect a pair bond with a high-quality male. Mutual
   mate choice and shared defense of a pair bond indicated that ``pair-bond
   defense{''} would be a more appropriate label than ``mate-defense{''}
   for the mating system of Harlequin Ducks and likely most monogamous
   avian species. Received 18 November 2012, accepted 1 February 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) is a focal species of
   concern associated with shallowly flooded emergent wetlands, most
   commonly sedge (Carex spp.) meadows. Their populations are believed to
   be limited by loss or degradation of wetland habitat due to drainage,
   altered hydrology, and fire suppression, factors that have often
   resulted in encroachment of shrubs into sedge meadows and change in
   vegetative cover. Nocturnal call-playback surveys for Yellow Rails were
   conducted over 3 years at Seney National Wildlife Refuge in the Upper
   Peninsula of Michigan. Effects of habitat structure and landscape
   variables on the probability of use by Yellow Rails were assessed at two
   scales, representing a range of home range sizes, using generalized
   linear mixed models. At the 163-m (8-ha) scale, year with quadratic
   models of maximum and mean water depths best explained the data. At the
   300-m (28-ha) scale, the best model contained year and time since last
   fire (<= 1, 2-5, and > 10 years). The probability of use by Yellow Rails
   was 0.285 +/- 0.132 (SE) for points burned 2-5 years ago, 0.253 +/-
   0.097 for points burned <= 1 year ago, and 0.028 +/- 0.019 for points
   burned > 10 years ago. Habitat differences relative to fire history and
   comparisons between sites with and without Yellow Rails indicated that
   Yellow Rails used areas with the deepest litter and highest ground
   cover, and relatively low shrub cover and heights, as well as landscapes
   having greater sedge-grass cover and less lowland woody or upland cover
   types. Burning every 2-5 years appears to provide the litter,
   ground-level cover, and woody conditions attractive to Yellow Rails.
   Managers seeking to restore and sustain these wetland systems would
   benefit from further investigations into how flooding and fire create
   habitat conditions attractive to breeding Yellow Rails. Received 30 July
   2012, accepted 30 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Male-biased, collision mortality of Whooping Cranes (Gras americana) in
   Florida may be associated with the tendency of males to lead flocks. The
   sex of Whooping Cranes was recorded for individuals leading flocks while
   flying and walking (n = 255). Males were more likely to lead than
   females both while walking and especially when flying. These
   observations support anecdotal reports that males tend to lead flocks.
   This flock behavior may partly explain male-biased mortality from
   collisions observed in Florida. Collision with power lines is the
   greatest known source of mortality for fledged Whooping Cranes. Our
   findings have implications for reintroductions and for the single
   existing self-sustaining population, which numbers > 250 individuals.

Abstract = {{Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) have recently expanded their breeding
   range into the northern Great Plains. We studied the nest success and
   survival of Snowy Plovers nesting on the Missouri River between Nebraska
   and South Dakota from 2008-2011 by monitoring nests every 2-3 days and
   banding adults and chicks. We used the logistic exposure method to
   estimate nest success and capture-recapture models in Program MARK to
   estimate adult and chick survival. Snowy Plover nests had a daily
   survival rate of 0.978 +/- 0.008, and annual adult apparent survival
   rate was 0.588 +/- 0.119. In addition, we estimated that 0.63 +/- 0.12
   of Snowy Plover chicks survived to fledging (30 days) during our study.
   The results for Snowy Plovers were similar to results for Piping Plovers
   (Charadrius melodus) breeding in the same area, and the demographic
   rates in this study were similar to those reported from established
   portions of the species' range. Recent breeding range expansion may be
   due to spring flooding on established breeding grounds coupled with the
   drying of lakes and reservoirs in the northern Great Plains Continued
   monitoring of breeding populations in this region should determine if
   expansion of the breeding area described in this study will persist,
   offering a rare opportunity to learn about population dynamics at the
   forefront of a species' range expansion. Received 8 September 2012,
   accepted 29 December 2012.}},

   Kleptoparasitic attacks mostly occurred shortly after a Common Coot
   surfaced with food and before it had ingested much of it. Attacked birds
   rarely resisted, and kleptoparasitic individuals had a success rate of
   85\% (n = 290), including cases when the victim managed to keep part of
   the food. Kleptoparasitic Common Coots used a mixed strategy,
   alternating between parasitism and self-feeding. Received 26 November

Abstract = {{Despite being listed as endangered, substantial morphological and
   behavioral variation exists within Black-capped Petrel (Pterodroma
   hasitata) populations. To examine the population genetic structure of
   the Black-capped Petrel, we amplified Cytochrome Oxidase 1 sequences
   from museum specimens collected during 1970-1980 off the coast of North
   Carolina, USA. These sequences revealed a 1.2\% fixed genetic difference
   between dark and light morphs. Individuals with intermediate plumage all
   grouped phylogenetically with the light morph. Combined with significant
   differences in body size and phenology, our genetic results suggest
   breeding isolation of the dark and light morphs. Consistent with other
   Pterodroma species, our results imply that the Black-capped Petrel may
   comprise two distinct, reproductively isolated taxa. Further knowledge
   about the genetic identity of birds at specific nesting colonies will be
   valuable for geographic delineation of populations. Received 10 August

   mortality, but in years when the overall mortality was high, the oldest
   age groups suffered three times the mortality rate incurred by the
   younger females. Over 58\% (n = 95) of all deaths of adult females each
   year occurred in a 60-day period starting in late May, just after the
   majority had hatched their eggs. Some of this mortality could be linked
   to the failure to build up large enough food reserves to meet both the
   costs of producing the eggs and then the stress of starving during the
   26-day incubation period. However, this ``capital{''} breeding strategy
   and variations in the availability of food in the period before laying
   did not totally explained the large year-to-year fluctuations in
   mortality, which varied by up to 33\% between consecutive years; it also
   did not explain the variation in age-related deaths. The causes of
   variations in the mortality rates of Common Eiders may be related to
   compromised immunity developed during incubation, increasing the risk of
   death from viruses and helminth parasite infections. Received 26 August
   2012, accepted 4 January 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The absence of juvenile sexual dimorphism in birds often impedes sex
   determination using external morphology. We examined sex ratio variation
   in Scopoli's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) fledglings (n = 135) on a
   Strofades island (southern Ionian Sea) between 2007 and 2011. We
   determined sex by using a polymerase chain reaction-based methodology on
   blood samples. The molecular technique revealed a slightly male-biased
   sex ratio (52.6\%) during the five consecutive breeding seasons. In
   addition, morphological analysis using six morphometric variables (bill
   length, bill width, nalospi, bill-head length, head length, tarsus
   length) and body weight indicated that males were significantly larger
   than females for all the tested variables. The combined use of those
   variables correctly classified 81.2\% of known-sex fledglings, and the
   stepwise discriminant analysis pointed out that bill length was the most
   discriminating variable followed by bill depth, head length, and body
   weight. Received 8 November 2012, accepted 4 February 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Although a species of conservation concern, little is known about the
   reproductive success of Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) throughout the
   southeastern USA where availability of natural beaches for nesting is
   limited. Daily survival rate (DSR) of nests and chicks was examined at
   four natural nesting sites in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge,
   South Carolina, 2009-2010. Measures of nest success (n = 257 nests)
   ranged from 0-93\% among colony sites. The DSR of nests was primarily
   related to colony site, but year and estimates of predation risk also
   were related to DSR. Predation was the principal cause of identifiable
   nest loss, accounting for 47\% of nest failures when the two years of
   data were pooled. The probability (+/- SE) of a chick surviving from
   hatching to fledging = 0.449 +/- 0.01 (n = 92 chicks). DSR of chicks was
   negatively related to tide height and rainfall. Therefore, productivity
   of Least Terns is being lost during both the nesting and chick stage
   through a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that may prove
   difficult to fully mitigate or manage. Although natural nesting sites
   within Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge intermittently produce
   successful nests, the consistency of productivity over the long term is
   still unknown. Given that the long term availability of anthropogenic
   nest sites (e.g., rooftops, dredge-spoil islands) for Least Terns is
   questionable, further research is required both locally and throughout
   the region to assess the extent to which natural sites act as population
   sources or sinks. Received 24 April 2012, accepted 11 October 2012.}},

   seasonal energy requirements of Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) and Great
   Egrets (Ardea alba) change. Foraging behavior was quantified during the
   breeding season in Kansas and during the non-breeding season in Florida
   using energetic algorithms and scan sampling. Fifty-eight percent (n =
   287) of breeding Snowy Egrets were observed ambulating while 51\% (n =
   271) of non-breeding Snowy Egrets were observed loafing. Standing
   foraging was the most commonly observed behavior among Great Egrets in
   both the breeding (54\%, n = 91) and non-breeding (38\%, n = 164)
   seasons. Behavior was dependent on season for both Snowy Egrets (x(2)=
   200.1, P< 0.001) and Great Egrets (x(2)= 187.4, P< 0.001). During the
   breeding season, Snowy Egrets expended 0.13 +/- 0.06W (Watts) in rivers
   and 0.08 + 0.02W at weirs. During the non-breeding season Snowy Egrets
   expended 0.06 +/- 0.01 W. During the breeding season Great Egrets
   expended 0.11 + 0.02W at both weirs and in rivers, and 0.09 +/- 0.02W
   during the non-breeding season (F-2,F-46= 7.86, P<0.0012). Snowy and
   Great egrets appear to vary their caloric demand on aquatic systems over
   the annual cycle. However, the quantity of energy derived from an
   ecosystem should not be the only factor taken into consideration in
   determining the value of that ecosystem. Received 9 April 2011, accepted

Abstract = {{Inter- and intra-specific interactions are potentially important factors
   influencing the distribution of populations. Aerial survey data,
   collected during range-wide breeding population surveys for Eastern
   Prairie Population (EPP) Canada Geese (Branta canadensis interior),
   1987-2008, were evaluated to assess factors influencing their nesting
   distribution. Specifically, associations between nesting Lesser Snow
   Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and EPP Canada Geese were
   quantified; and changes in the spatial distribution of EPP Canada Geese
   were identified. Mixed-effects Poisson regression models of EPP Canada
   Goose nest counts were evaluated within a cross-validation framework.
   The total count of EPP Canada Goose nests varied moderately among years
   between 1987 and 2008 with no long-term trend; however, the total count
   of nesting Lesser Snow Geese generally increased. Three models
   containing factors related to previous EPP Canada Goose nest density
   (representing recruitment), distance to Hudson Bay (representing
   brood-habitat), nesting habitat type, and Lesser Snow Goose nest density
   (inter-specific associations) were the most accurate, improving
   prediction accuracy by 45\% when compared to intercept-only models. EPP
   Canada Goose nest density varied by habitat type, was negatively
   associated with distance to coastal brood-rearing areas, and suggested
   density-dependent intra-specific effects on recruitment. However, a
   non-linear relationship between Lesser Snow and EPP Canada Goose nest
   density suggests that as nesting Lesser Snow Geese increase, EPP Canada
   Geese locally decline and subsequently the spatial distribution of EPP
   Canada Geese on western Hudson Bay has changed. Received 8 May 2012,

Abstract = {{While the breeding and wintering ranges of the eastern population of
   Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) are generally described,
   molting locations and links among breeding, molting, and wintering areas
   are unclear, particularly for adult females. Incubating females from the
   same breeding location (n = 5) were equipped with satellite transmitters
   in June 2009. Four molting sites were identified over 2 years, spread
   broadly across Quebec: an inlet in Ungava Bay 1,100 km from the breeding
   area, a lake 100 km south of Ungava Bay (880 km from breeding area), a
   lake near Hudson Bay (910 km from breeding area) and the mouth of the
   Riviere aux Outardes River in the St. Lawrence Estuary (165 km from
   breeding area). The distance between molting females averaged 755 km and
   two females molted in regions where males were known to molt. Of four
   birds with consecutive years of molt locations, three showed
   inter-annual fidelity to within 5 km of the previous molt sites and the
   fourth molted in sites that were 968 km apart. Females wintered in
   different locations within the St. Lawrence Estuary and moved widely
   throughout the area during winter. The south coast of the St. Lawrence
   Estuary was used during spring and fall staging, and the north coast
   during winter. There was not strong migratory connectivity among annual
   cycle stages in eastern adult female Barrow's Goldeneyes, indicating
   that they should be considered a single management unit that occurs over
   a broad range throughout the year. Received 30 March 2012, accepted 17

Abstract = {{Recreational boat traffic is increasing worldwide and there is a need
   for scientifically based regulations that sustain both seabirds and
   wildlife viewing. The effects of boat disturbance to seabirds off
   Vancouver Island, Canada were quantified by testing distances that
   roosting or nesting birds showed an agitation response to an approaching
   motorboat or a kayak. The effects of species sensitivity, vessel type,
   habituation and season on agitation distance were examined. At 40 m from
   approaching boats, nesting Double-crested (Phalacrocorax auritus) and
   Pelagic (P pelagicus) cormorants, Black Oystercatchers (Haematapus
   bachmani), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), and Pigeon
   Guillemots (Cepphus columba) had less than 6\% probability of being
   agitated with either a kayak or motorboat, while at 50 m there was less
   than 2\% probability of agitation. Roosting birds had larger response
   distances than nesting birds. Roosting Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus
   histrionicus) were particularly sensitive with 24\% probability of
   agitation at distances less than 50 m. Agitation distances were reduced
   by habituation to boat traffic and a single kayak could approach closer
   than a motorboat without disturbing seabirds. A general set-back
   guideline of 50 m would protect most nest and roost sites while allowing
   viewers to appreciate seabirds. Setbacks could be adjusted to protect
   locally sensitive sites or species. Received 7 May 2012, accepted 20

   locations and Decoys}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Within the context of a limited number of Brown Pelican (Pelecanus
   occidentalis) breeding sites, promoting new colonies can mitigate
   localized threats to regional populations. To assess the efficacy of
   short-distance (similar to 5 km) translocations and use of decoys to
   establish new colonies, and thereby increase statewide population
   viability, research was conducted within the Isles Dernieres
   archipelago, Louisiana. Translocadons of 323 Brown Pelican chicks to an
   un-colonized island were performed from 2007 to 2009, and from 2008 to
   2010, 108 Brown Pelican decoys were deployed on a separate island void
   of nesting. From 2008 to 2010 band re-sighting surveys detected only one
   transplanted Brown Pelican chick that returned to the release site.
   Further, < 1\% of translocated individuals were observed throughout the
   archipelago, compared to 5\% and 9\% of banded individuals encountered
   that fledged from nearby islands. Low detection of translocated Brown
   Pelicans may be due to translocation stress that can result in
   disorientation and social disorganization, which may promote increased
   roaming. At sites with decoys, no loafing or nesting Brown Pelicans were
   observed. Further, behavioral surveys suggest there was no difference in
   interest of passing Brown Pelicans to decoys compared to paired control
   survey areas without decoys. Despite past successes of translocations
   and decoys for establishing new colonies of Brown Pelicans and other
   waterbird species, Brown Pelican conservation may be best promoted via
   restoration and protection of current colony sites. Received 6 April
   2012, accepted 17 October 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) use coastal wetlands in the
   southeastern United States during spring migration, some engaging in
   short-distance movements and brief refueling stops. Knowledge about the
   scale and factors that influence these movements could guide
   conservation planning, but often this information is not available. The
   influence of inter-wetland distance, prey biomass, amount of foraging
   habitat at depths of 0-4 cm, and density of migrating Semipalmated
   Sandpipers on their movement and stopover residency was investigated at
   the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center in South Carolina in spring 2007. Tom
   Yawkey Wildlife Center contains three clusters of coastal wetlands
   separated by 2.6, 2.8 and 4.1 km. Probability of moving among wetland
   clusters and stopover residency were estimated using multi-state
   mark-recapture models and encounter histories from 502 marked
   Semipalmated Sandpipers. Sixty-four percent of Semipalmated Sandpipers
   remained within 2 km of site-of-capture for the duration of the study.
   Movement probabilities were negatively influenced by inter-cluster
   distance and Semipalmated Sandpiper density. Probability of moving
   between clusters 2.6-2.8 km apart was higher than clusters separated by
   4.1 km. Semipalmated Sandpipers were more likely to depart the study
   area and resume migration after feeding in wetland clusters with
   abundant prey and accessible habitat. The interaction between prey and
   accessible habitat led to instances where Semipalmated Sandpipers were
   more likely to remain in wetlands with low prey levels, but high
   accessible habitat, or low accessible habitat, but high prey levels.
   Local movements among alternative foraging locations were facilitated
   when wetlands were < 2.8 km apart, highlighting the benefits of
   integrated management at small scales. Received 29 July 2011, accepted 4

Abstract = {{Humphrey and Parkes (1959) developed a molt and plumage nomenclature
   (the ``H-P{''} system) based on the evolution of prebasic molts in birds
   from ecdysis events in reptiles, followed by later evolution of inserted
   molts responding to lineage-specific constraints and adaptations in
   Ayes. Pyle (2005) revised H-P molt and plumage terminology of ducks by
   tracing the evolution of their molts from geese, whereas Hawkins (2011)
   defended traditional molt and plumage terminologies that defined molts
   relative to present-day breeding seasonality, ensuing plumage
   coloration, and other proximal factors. Apart from misinterpreting H-P's
   evolutionary approach, Hawkins (2011) confused the first-cycle terms of
   H-P, Howell et al. (2003), and Pyle (2005), and presented no new data or
   ideas to support traditional molt terminology in ducks. It is unlikely
   that inserted molts evolved in ancestral taxa based on yet-to-occur
   adaptations involving plumage color, and it is inconsistent to define
   homologous molts based on similar ensuing feather coloration while
   disregarding the substantially different coloration of homologous
   plumages within many avian lineages. Here the terminology of Pyle (2005)
   is defended, an alternative interpretation for the initial evolution of
   two (rather than one) inserted molts in the definitive cycles of female
   and male ducks is elaborated upon, and the future application of
   metabolic signatures to trace homologous molts in ducks and other bird
   lineages is suggested. Prebasic molts in ducks and other birds likely
   evolved from whole-scale restorative events common to all vertebrates,
   whereas distinguishable and less-comprehensive endocrinological and
   metabolic processes may accompany inserted molts. Received 10 July 2012,

Title = {{Evaluating Methodological Assumptions of Catch-Curve Survival Estimation
   for Unmarked Precocial Shorebird Chicks}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-87}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Estimating productivity for precocial species can be difficult because
   young birds leave their nest within hours or days of hatching and
   detectability thereafter can be very low. Recently, a method for using a
   modified catch-urve to estimate precocial chick daily survival for age
   based count data was presented using Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)
   data from the Missouri River. However, many of the assumptions of the
   catch-curve approach were not fully evaluated for precocial chicks. We
   developed a simulation model to mimic Piping Plovers, a fairly
   representative shorebird, and age-based count-data collection. Using the
   simulated data, we calculated daily survival estimates and compared them
   with the known daily survival rates from the simulation model. We
   conducted these comparisons under different sampling scenarios where the
   ecological and statistical assumptions had been violated. Overall, the
   daily survival estimates calculated from the simulated data corresponded
   well with true survival rates of the simulation. Violating the accurate
   aging and the independence assumptions did not result in biased daily
   survival estimates, whereas unequal detection for younger or older birds
   and violating the birth death equilibrium did result in estimator bias.
   Assuring that all ages are equally detectable and timing data collection
   to approximately meet the birth death equilibrium are key to the
   successful use of this method for precocial shorebirds. Received 5 June
   2012, accepted 24 September 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Response of breeding waterbird communities to the effects of hurricanes
   remains poorly understood. The impact of two 2008 hurricanes on the
   breeding waterbird community was investigated at the Isles Dernieres
   Barrier Island Refuge in southern Louisiana using pre- and
   post-hurricane survey data. After the 2008 hurricanes, the breeding
   community was reduced from 44,042 breeding pairs in 2008 to 27,977 pairs
   in 2009 and to 23,544 pairs in 2010. Populations of the five most
   abundant species, Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), Laughing Gull
   (Leucophaeus atricilla), Royal Tern (Thallasseus maximus), Sandwich Tern
   (Thallasseus sandvincensis), and Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger),
   decreased from 2008 to 2010. In contrast, populations of Roseate
   Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), Sooty Tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), and
   Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica) increased from 2008 to 2009 but
   declined in 2010. The dramatic decline of total breeding pairs in the
   year following hurricanes demonstrates the vulnerability of this
   community to tropical storms and habitat degradation. Further
   investigations of this community are necessary to understand how major
   disturbances affect resilience and long-term viability of colonial
   waterbird communities on barrier islands. Received 21 June 2012,

Abstract = {{Black-faced Cormorants (Phalacrocorax fuscescens) are endemic to marine
   environments in southern Australia and little is known of their biology
   Development of a reliable and practical method for sexing adult birds in
   the field is necessary to aid research into their behavior and
   life-history Eleven measurements from museum specimens (27 male; 31
   female) were used to document sexual dimorphism in Black-faced
   Cormorants using discriminant function analyses (DFA). A simultaneous
   DFA correctly sexed 81\% of birds, while a stepwise DFA correctly sexed
   85\% of birds based on two measurements (bill length and mid tail
   length). However, terminal wear of the retrices make this measurement
   unreliable. A logistic regression using bill length correctly predicted
   the sex of 78\% of individuals. Black-faced Cormorants with a bill <= 76
   mm long are likely female and >= 77 mm long are likely male, therefore
   providing a reliable method for assigning sex in the field. Black-faced
   Cormorants exhibit the same pattern of sexual dimorphism found in all
   other cormorants studied to date: males are larger, more robust and have
   a longer bill compared to the smaller, relatively gracile and
   shorter-billed females. The use of this general rule to assign sex to
   adult Black-faced Cormorants was confirmed through the observation of
   mating behavior. Therefore, this study provides a dependable and
   practicable technique for assigning sex in the field without the need to
   capture birds and disturb their behavior. Received 21 June 2012,
   accepted 4 October 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that determine waterfowl nesting site
   selection is an essential tool for wetland management, but,
   unfortunately, this information is lacking for most species in the
   Southern Hemisphere. During the 2007 breeding season, reproductive
   biology and nesting habitat selection of the Red Shoveler (Anas
   platalea) were investigated in a wetland of Central Chile. Red Shoveler
   nests were clumped, primarily in scrubby meadows, containing an average
   of 8.56 +/- 1 eggs (n = 2 3). Nesting microhabitat was characterized by
   well-covered ground and an intermediate height of the rich herbaceous
   layer close to the water. Hatching success was 80 +/- 20\% and was
   negatively associated with the number of cattle dung piles and the
   proportion of dry vegetation, but positively explained by herbaceous
   height and the distance to watercourse. Results suggest that the risk of
   predation, the access to food, and cattle disturbance would affect the
   selection of breeding sites and nest success of Red Shoveler. Management
   should focus on increasing diversity the herbaceous layer, ensuring easy
   access to water sources, and decreasing livestock pressure during the
   nesting period. Received 7 July 2012, accepted 26 November 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Selection of a nest site that affords camouflage of eggs or incubating
   adults is thought to be strongly influenced by predation, especially for
   ground-nesting birds. Data from 115 Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus)
   nests were used to model relationships between nest survival, habitat
   characteristics, predator activity and human activity on four sandy,
   ocean-fronting beaches in coastal northern California from 2007-2009.
   Plover daily nest survival was higher at two southern sites (South Spit
   range = 0.98-0.99; Eel River Wildlife Area range = 0.91-0.96) compared
   with two northern sites (Mad River Beach range = 0.77-0.88; Clam Beach
   range = 0.79-0.89) where predator activity was appreciably higher. Nest
   survival was positively related to debris heterogeneity and negatively
   related to the amount of debris near the nest, but these relationships
   were weaker than the site-level effect. Although plovers select nest
   sites among cryptic debris in sparsely vegetated areas, restoration that
   creates and enhances such habitats may have limited utility at sites
   where predators are abundant. Thus, managers must carefully consider
   predator activity at the landscape level in order to maximize the
   effectiveness of fine-scale restoration efforts. Received 29 August
   2011, accepted 24 August 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes the selection of breeding habitat by Little
   Terns (Sternula albifrons) nesting on sandy beaches in southern Portugal
   and the consequences of nest site selection for breeding performance. A
   range of physical and biological factors were used to assess the
   reproductive consequences of the birds' decisions, using three
   complementary approaches: 1) the characteristics of individual nest
   sites were compared with those of random points within a colony, 2) a
   Binomial Generalised Linear Model was used to examine which nest-site
   characteristics, including proximity to conspecific nests, might explain
   the success of Little Tern nests, and 3) a field experiment with
   artificial nests was conducted to test whether avoiding nesting near
   vegetation improves nesting success. Little Terns generally placed their
   nests approximately two thirds of the distance between mean high water
   and the seaward edge of the dunes, with a tendency to avoid vegetated
   areas but with a preference for a higher coverage of debris. Nesting
   success was about 35\% higher in coarse sand compared to fine sand and
   was higher for nests closer to their nearest neighbor. Nests placed up
   to about 20 m distant from the nearest neighbor were about 5\% more
   likely to succeed earlier in the season but nests at distances of 30 m
   or more to the nearest conspecific had a much higher probability of
   success later in the season. The combination of interacting abiotic and
   biotic factors identified as explaining Little Terns' nest site
   selection and nesting success provide insights relevant to the
   conservation management of birds breeding on sandy beaches. Received 28
   October 2011, accepted 22 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Given historical patterns of decline, the American Black Duck (Anas
   rubripes) has long been a species of concern. To support the
   identification of core Maritime habitat, the distribution of breeding
   ducks was mapped at the landscape scale through the combination of
   GIS-based land cover information and five years of intensive aerial
   surveys (2006-2010). A predictive, mixed effects model was used to
   generate the maps, based on the weighted average of coefficients for the
   top 95\% of all-possible models (as measured by AIC weights). The
   results of the averaged mixed model indicated that annual variation
   (YEAR), availability of surface water (WET AREA, LAKE\_AREA and
   WET\_DIVERSITY) and occurrence of active agricultural landscapes
   (AG\_PROP and ROAD\_DENSITY) were strongly associated with the number of
   breeding pairs. The presence of larger numbers of breeding ducks in
   agricultural landscapes represents a departure from studies conducted in
   more intensively utilized regions (e.g. southern Ontario and Quebec),
   and suggest that the benefits of breeding in Maritime agricultural areas
   outweigh potential costs. Using 34,659 prediction points, duck
   distribution was modeled in relatively high and low years (2008 and
   2006, respectively), resulting in detailed maps suitable for the
   identification of priority areas for habitat restoration and
   enhancement. In order to help refine conservation management plans,
   future work should more closely examine the impact of different types
   and combinations of Maritime agricultural production to better
   understand the way these landscapes attract breeding ducks. Received 29

Abstract = {{The migratory population of the King Rail (Rallus elegans) has declined
   dramatically during the past 50 years, emphasizing the need to document
   the distribution and status of this species to help guide conservation
   efforts. In an effort to guide King Rail breeding habitat protection and
   restoration, a landscape suitability index (LSD model was developed for
   the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture (JV).
   To validate this model, 264 sites were surveyed across the JV region in
   2008 and 2009 using the National Marshbird Monitoring protocol. Two
   other similarly collected data sets from Wisconsin (250 sites) and Ohio
   (259 sites) as well as data from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's
   eBird database were added to our data set. Sampling effort was not
   uniform across the study area. King Rails were detected at 29 sites with
   the greatest concentration in southeastern Wisconsin and northeastern
   Illinois. Too few detections were made to validate the LSI model. King
   Rail detection sites tended to have microtopographic heterogeneity, more
   emergent herbaceous wetland vegetation and less woody vegetation. The
   migrant population of the King Rail is rare and warrants additional
   conservation efforts to achieve stated conservation population targets.

Abstract = {{In the first comprehensive survey of post-breeding shorebirds conducted
   along the remote deltaic mudflat habitats on the coastline of the Arctic
   National Wildlife Refuge, six species of shorebirds were documented
   aggregating prior to southbound migration. Energy reserves gained while
   foraging in these areas may be critical for southbound migration of
   long-distance migrant shorebirds, but these habitats are vulnerable to
   potential effects of oil and gas development and climate change. The
   study objective was to assess the relative density and species
   composition of shorebirds. Surveys were conducted at 13 major river
   deltas on the coast between late July and mid-August each year from 2006
   to 2010. Double-observer methods were used in 2010 to estimate the
   detection rate in surveys of randomly-selected transect sections.
   Shorebird density varied significantly between years and among river
   deltas. Peak relative density estimates at three deltas, the Jago (247.8
   birds/km(2)), the Kongakut (100.6 birds/km(2)) and the Hulahula (49.5
   birds/km(2)), were significantly higher than the estimate for the
   Canning (16.0 birds/km(2)). Because shorebird density and abundance vary
   significantly among sites and years, and individuals likely move among
   multiple sites within a given year, shorebird conservation strategies
   for these habitats should consider them to be spatially and temporally
   interconnected. Received 7 April 2012, accepted 30 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{In the Camargue (southern France), drastic changes in wetlands have
   occurred (notably extension of agriculture and salt extraction) since
   the 1960s, which affect the resources available to migratory waterbirds.
   Winter diets of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Teal (A. crecca) in
   2006-2008 were assessed by analyses of gullet contents. Using PCA-based
   methods, duck diets were described and the main feeding habitats used by
   each duck species were then determined with a typology analysis. The
   same four food items were most important (in terms of occurrence and
   average dry weight) in the diet of Mallard and Teal: Oryza saliva
   (rice), Echinothloa sp., Scirpus maritimus and Potamogeton pusillus
   seeds. However, Teal diet was more diversified, with eleven feeding
   habitat types, compared to only five in Mallard. Both species were found
   to be dependent on ricefields and ricefield-like habitats. Compared to
   previous studies in the same area between 1964 and 1981, permanent
   freshwater habitats now appear to be used more intensively by Mallard
   and Teal, while temporary marshes are used to a lesser extent. Since the
   1960s, temporary marshes have been partially replaced by permanent
   freshwater in order to attract more ducks, mostly for hunting. The
   flexibility of duck diet in response to changing food availability may
   explain why duck populations have not decreased in the Camargue or in
   Europe despite changes in land use. Received 14 February 2012, accepted

Abstract = {{Quantifying variation in diet over time and space is important for
   understanding patterns of habitat use in marine birds. Diet composition
   of adult male White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) was quantified at
   five study sites in coastal British Columbia and Washington during
   mid-winter (December) and late winter (February-March). At four sites
   where White-winged Scoters fed in nearshore areas, diet varied little
   between winter periods and birds fed almost exclusively an large
   infaunal bivalves (>= 85\% of mean ash-free dry mass of esophagus
   contents for each season x site combination). The main prey of
   White-winged Scoters in intertidal foraging areas (N = 3 of 5 study
   sites) were Varnish clams (Nuttalia obscurata), which were introduced to
   the region within the last 25 years. At an offshore site, diet consisted
   mainly of bivalves except during one period when White-winged Scoters
   had consumed mainly fish, crustaceans, polychaetes and echinoderms.
   Greater temporal variation in diet at the offshore site may have been an
   effect of reduced time available to locate preferred prey items and
   lower predictability of prey distributions owing to this site's greater
   exposure to wind and waves. However, neither exposure nor water depth
   received appreciable support in models of the dietary fraction of
   bivalves across sites and periods. Our results underscore the importance
   of marine areas with high densities of infaunal bivalves to White-winged
   Scoters, but also show that White-winged Scoters exhibit flexibility to
   adjust diet in response to differences in prey composition across
   habitats. Received 6 June 2012, accepted 22 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The study aim was to describe and explain the distribution of waterbird
   breeding colonies in the vicinity of one of Uganda's largest rice
   schemes, Doho, a major feeding site for waterbirds. A total of 18
   colonies were identified in which six species bred and two others were
   found roosting. Colony size ranged from seven to 588 breeding pairs. All
   colonies were located within human settlements, contrasting with
   patterns seen in typical waterbird colonies in Europe and America.
   Seventy-five percent of waterbirds placed their nests on Mvule trees
   (Milicia excelsea) while the number of breeding pairs was positively
   correlated to the number of trees at colonies. Contrary to expectations,
   colony size was not correlated with distance from the Doho rice scheme,
   or with the amount of foraging area within one, five and 10 km from the
   colony. These results suggest that nesting, rather than foraging habitat
   could be restricting the distribution and potentially population sizes
   of tree-nesting waterbirds in our study area. They also highlight the
   importance of the Mvule as nesting habitat for waterbirds, a tree
   species that is in great need of protection throughout Uganda, and
   presumably throughout other parts of Africa. Received 12 February 2009,

Abstract = {{To understand the adaptive significance of colonial breeding, evaluating
   the costs and benefits that colonial breeding provides to individuals is
   necessary. To study some of these costs and benefits of colonial
   breeding, over 24,000 nest-hour observations of kleptoparasitism
   (stealing of food being fed to young), intraspecific attacks on and
   killing of chicks; and chick adoption were conducted in colonial
   breeding Black-tailed Gulls (Larus crassirostris) during two breeding
   seasons. Although kleptoparasitism was rarely observed (under 0.001
   events/nest/observational hour), the occurrence of chick-attacks was
   5-10 times higher (0.005-0.01 events/nest/observational hour) than that
   of kleptoparasitism, with over 10\% of the attacks resulting in the
   death or disappearance of chicks. More than 60\% of all attacks on
   chicks were by failed breeders and non-breeding adult floaters. The
   survival of attacked chicks reached 98-100\% if they escaped into other
   nests and were accepted by ``foster{''} adults, or if they were defended
   by non-parental,adults. Chick adoption and non-parental defense were
   more likely to be observed among breeding neighbors (52-60\% of chick
   adoptions and almost all examples of non-parental defense) than among
   non-neighbors. An increased chick survival rate, resulting from nesting
   in close to proximity to conspecific neighbors, was considered as a
   factor promoting colonial breeding among the Laridae. Received 20

Abstract = {{The commentary follows the story of colonial waterbird conservation in
   the United States over the past 150 years. Colonial waterbirds,
   especially egrets and pelicans, played an important role in the founding
   of the American bird conservation movement. At the beginning of the 20th
   Century, bird conservation activity self-organized, inspired creation of
   refuges for colonial waterbirds, protected colonies with wardens, and
   secured passage of conservation laws. Thereafter Federal and state
   governments slowly grew in their authorities and commitment to bird
   conservation. Successes achieved, colonial waterbirds fell from priority
   during the remainder of the first half of the 20th Century, although
   legislative, administrative and academic progress was made of
   considerable subsequent value. In the 1960s and 1970s, colonial
   waterbirds resumed a significant role, first in contaminant studies and
   then in population inventories. This engagement encouraged maturation of
   a colonial waterbird research and conservation agenda in the United
   States, including founding of the Waterbird Society which facilitated a
   blossoming of colonial waterbird research in the succeeding decades. In
   the national conservation planning initiatives of the 1990s, colonial
   waterbirds were represented by the North American Waterbird Conservation
   Plan, later Waterbird Conservation for the Americas. Waterbirds are now
   well integrated in bird conservation planning and action at multiple
   scales in the United States. Conservation biology, assessment,
   protection and site management have progressed well, while population
   estimation, monitoring and data archiving have not. Appropriate
   direction seems clear, involving regional coordination of the actions of
   local stakeholders. Received 10 June 2012 accepted 31 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The Socotra Cormorant Phalacrocorax nigrogularis is a little studied,
   regional endemic seabird restricted to the Arabian Gulf region
   threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. The global population is
   estimated at 110,000 breeding pairs. The Siniya Island colony, the
   largest in the United Arab Emirates (similar to 15,500 breeding pairs),
   was studied during the 2011 breeding season to determine baseline
   reproductive parameters and the effect of exotic trees on reproductive
   performance. Mean nesting density was 0.92 nests/m(2) and shaded areas
   had significantly higher density (1.05/m(2)) compared to unshaded areas
   (0.75/m(2)). Mean clutch size was 2.4 eggs/nest and did not differ
   between shaded and unshaded areas. Mean egg volume was significantly
   higher in shaded (49.56 cm(3)) compared to unshaded areas (48.5 cm(3)).
   Hatching success was significantly higher in shaded (65.1\%) compared to
   unshaded areas (46.6\%). Fledging success was 65.6\% and did not differ
   between shaded and unshaded areas. Chicks creched under trees soon after
   leaving their nests and this likely increased fledging success,
   regardless of whether chicks came from shaded or unshaded areas. Overall
   reproductive success was 1.7 chicks/nest. Higher egg volumes and
   hatching success under shaded areas suggest that plantations had a
   beneficial effect on the cormorants on Siniya Island and could be of
   conservation value. Further studies are required to determine what
   habitat features linked with these trees specifically aid in enhancing
   reproductive performance. Received 3 April 2012, accepted 30 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Using mark-recapture models, apparent survival was estimated from older
   banding and re-sighting data (1978-1983) of American Oystercatchers
   (Haematopus palliatus) nesting on beaches and in salt marshes of coastal
   Virginia, USA. Oystercatchers nesting in salt marshes exhibited higher
   apparent survival (0.94 +/- 0.03) than birds nesting on beaches (0.81
   +/- 0.06), a difference due to variation in mortality, permanent
   emigration, or both. Nesting on exposed barrier beaches may subject
   adults and young to higher risk of predation. These early estimates of
   adult survival for a species that is heavily monitored along the
   Atlantic and Gulf Coasts can be used to (1) develop demographic models
   to determine population stability, (2) compare with estimates of adult
   survival from populations that have reached carrying capacity, and (3)
   compare with estimates of survival from other oystercatcher populations
   and species. Received 24 February 2012, accepted 17 July 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal (semestral) counts of aquatic birds at five Andean lakes in
   Ecuador (Colta, La Mica, Yambo, Yahuarcocha and San Pablo) were analyzed
   to detect trends in population size between 2004 and 2011. Trends of
   four abundant species (Ardea alba, Anas georgica, Fulica ardesiaca and
   Oxyura jamaicensis) and those of five functional groups (based upon body
   size and diet) were tested using generalized additive mixed modeling. In
   total, 19 bird species were consistently recorded over the whole period.
   The Andean Coot (E. ardesiaca) was found in highest densities (c. 3
   birds per ha at Colta and Yambo). No significant trend's were detected.
   However, the counts of functional groups exhibited a seasonal pattern
   (higher counts in February than in July), possibly due to lower resource
   availability in the dry season. Piscivorous species were relatively
   abundant at one lake (Yahuarcocha), which might be related to the
   introduction of Tilapiine cichlid fishes. Received 29 February 2012,
   accepted 26 June 2012.}},

Abstract = {{There are two recognized subspecies of the Piping Plover (Charadrius
   melodus): the Atlantic coast United States and Canada ('Atlantic')
   subspecies and the Great Lakes and Northern Great Plains ('Interior')
   subspecies. More than 7,000 Piping Plovers have been banded and
   monitored since 1982, yet no individual marked as a hatchling or
   breeding adult in the range of one subspecies has been reported breeding
   in the range of the other. Recent molecular genetic analyses further
   support subspecific taxonomic classification of Atlantic and Interior
   breeding populations. On 22 May 2011, a banded Piping Plover and
   unbanded mate were observed nesting on North Core Banks, Cape Lookout
   National Seashore, North Carolina, USA. The uniquely-banded adult was a
   female captured as a chick at Wasaga Beach, Georgian Bay, Ontario,
   Canada; the female nested unsuccessfully in its first breeding year at
   Tawas Point State Park, Michigan, USA and then successfully fledged two
   chicks in its second breeding year at North Core Banks, North Carolina,
   USA. The observation is the first confirmed record of a Piping Plover
   dispersing from its subspecies' range and successfully breeding in the
   range of the other subspecies. Received 30 April 2012, accepted 7 July

Abstract = {{Migrating shorebird populations using approximately 2\% of Louisiana and
   Texas Gulf Coastal rice fields were surveyed during spring migration
   (March-May of 1997 and 1998) using biweekly stratified random surveys
   conducted at 50 roadside survey points and approximately 30,000
   shorebirds were observed. Shorebird counts were extrapolated and almost
   1.4 million birds in 1997 and over 1.6 million birds of 31 species in
   1998 were estimated to use rice field habitat for stopover sites in
   Louisiana and Texas. Greater than 50\% of the estimated North American
   populations were estimated to use rice field habitats for five species,
   including a species of concern, Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites
   subruficollis) at 187\%. Because of predictability of suitable rice
   field habitat acreage, timing of field preparation and water
   availability, coastal rice prairies are identified as critical spring

Abstract = {{Use of rice fields as complementary habitats to waterbird species was
   investigated. Three questions were posed (I) does waterbird richness
   (defined as number of species), abundance and composition differ between
   rice fields and natural wetlands; (2) do richness, abundance and
   composition of waterbird species differ between flooded and drained rice
   fields in the post-harvest season, and (3) do richness, abundance and
   composition of waterbird species change in rice fields over the rice
   cultivation cycle? Eight collections were made in eight rice fields with
   different hydrological conditions after cultivation (four dry and four
   flooded) and four natural wetlands. Waterbirds were censused using
   binoculars and one telescope. A total of 76 waterbird species were
   observed during the study period (2005-2006): 59 species in rice fields
   and 70 species in natural wetlands. The richness of waterbirds was
   higher in natural wetlands than flooded and drained rice fields;
   however, there was no difference between flooded and drained rice
   fields. The richness of waterbirds did not change over the rice
   cultivation cycle. Waterbird abundance was higher in natural wetlands
   than in flooded and drained rice fields. Natural wetlands showed a
   seasonal pattern of species composition and abundance different from
   rice fields. Rice fields are used for an important fraction of the
   waterbird richness in southern Brazil, acting as habitat complementary
   for biodiversity, but in lower richness and abundance when compared to
   natural wetlands. The non-intentional flooding of rice fields did not
   contribute towards waterbird conservation in southern Brazil. Received 1

Abstract = {{Wading birds have been observed foraging in agricultural wetlands
   worldwide where natural wetlands have become lost, degraded, or
   seasonally dry, yet the ability of wading birds to satisfy daily energy
   requirements in agricultural wetlands has been little studied. The
   ability to meet daily energy requirements for Little Blue Herons
   (Egretta caerulea) and Great Egrets (Ardea alba) foraging in flooded
   rice and fallow fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) was
   evaluated during April-June 2008 and 2009. Focal samples were used to
   measure capture rates (captures/min), identify prey and estimate
   captured prey size, and calculate energy budgets for both species.
   Within flooded fields prey density was measured and foraging sites and
   random locations were compared. Habitat variables did not differ between
   foraging sites and random locations. Vegetation cover and prey abundance
   increased in rice fields over time and were greater in rice than fallow
   fields. Small prey, dominated by fish, were captured by both species and
   corresponded to prey sampled. Most wading birds in June were observed in
   newly flooded fallow fields despite lower prey densities. Little Blue
   Herons met daily energy requirements for both years; but Great Egrets
   did not, likely clue to predominantly small prey, increasing vegetative
   cover in rice fields, and lower prey densities in newly flooded fallow
   fields. Although Great Egrets did not meet daily caloric requirements,
   the EAA may still function as an important transitional habitat at a
   time when foraging resources in the region are limited. Received 5

Abstract = {{To better understand how birds balance the demands of reproduction and
   food-provisioning, Snowy Egrets (Egret to thula) were studied from
   May-July 2009 and 2010 in a mixed-species colony in Wichita, Kansas.
   Observations included 68 h of scan samples at 34 nests which yielded
   >11,000 instantaneous records; the durations of 57 food-provisioning
   trips made by eight radio-tagged birds; 73 records of foraging
   locations, and 27 Is of foraging activity and aggressive intraspecific
   interactions. Adult activities at the nest included sitting (41\% of the
   time), standing (18\%), preening (10\%), nest maintenance (7\%) and
   feeding chicks (<1\%). Incubating adults spent significantly more time
   sitting but less time standing than did adults with chicks. The amount
   of time that both parents were away from the nest increased
   significantly with chick age. Multiple regression analysis with AIC
   modeling showed that Julian date, chick stage, and year were important
   predictor variables in nest activity patterns. Mean food-provisioning
   intervals (242 22 min; range = 52-539 min) differed among radio-tagged
   birds, but did not differ by time of day or date. Round-trip flight
   distances averaged 16.1 +/- 3.2 km (range = 6-49 km), and also differed
   among birds. Distances to foraging sites were combined with published
   energetic values to estimate flight costs. Compared with birds that used
   distant foraging sites (>18 km from the colony), birds that used sites
   near the colony (<3 km) had higher capture efficiencies but caught
   smaller prey, had much higher rates of aggression, and lower rates of
   energy intake. Received 8 February 2011, accepted 19 March 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The diets of four seabird species (N = 20-21 individuals per species)
   were compared to determine whether sexual size dimorphism is involved in
   intersexual differences in diet composition and niche size. Diet
   compositions of Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), Herring Gull
   (Lams argentatus), Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinas) and Razorbill
   (Alca tardy) were assessed during their breeding season in the Gulf of
   St. Lawrence, Canada by using: Bayesian mixing models using stable
   carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis on the red blood cells of adults
   and direct field assessments of food items carried by adults to chicks.
   A total of 50 regurgitations for kittiwakes, 40 regurgitations and 76
   pellets for gulls (two species combined) and 78 prey loads for
   Razorbills were characterized. Diet composition varied widely among
   seabird species and between methods of assessment. Isotopic niche size
   of adults was greater for males than for females for species with clear
   dimorphism (Herring Gull and Great Black-backed Gull), whereas
   differences in niche size between sexes became insignificant when sexual
   size dimorphism decreased (Black-legged Kittiwake). Conversely, for the
   monomorphic Razorbill, females displayed a larger isotopic variance than
   males, suggesting that factors other than body size are involved in
   shaping niche size. Received 13 April 2011, accepted 4 May 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of breeding European Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) was
   studied at Sklinna, one of the world's largest colonies, during
   2007-2010. Regurgitated pellets were collected regularly throughout the
   chick rearing period and hard parts used to identify prey items to the
   lowest possible taxonomic level. The length and width of otoliths were
   used to estimate fish body length and mass. Shags' diet was varied and
   contained at least 17 different species of fish. Gadoid species,
   including saithe (Pollachius virens), cod (Gadus morhua) and Poor Cod
   (Trisopterus minutus), were the main prey and contributed approximately
   90\% of the diet during the study period. Saithe dominated the diet by
   numerical frequency, biomass and frequency of occurrence in all study
   years. Sandeels (Ammodytidae) contributed little to shag diet. The
   numerical frequency and percentage saithe biomass was lower in 2010 than
   in the other years. However, this was compensated by a higher frequency
   of cod and poor cod, making the total biomass of gadoids equal to
   previous years. The total biomass of gadoids caught by the shags at this
   colony was estimated at 340 metric tons, of which 266 tons were of 0-2
   group saithe. The amount represents 0.1\% of the total quota (by weight)
   for the fisheries and might, thus, be of minor importance for the
   fisheries. However, the estimated 30 million individuals represent 17\%
   of the total number of individuals that was estimated to be recruited to
   the population as 3-year-old saithe in 2007-2010. Received 27 October
   2011, accepted 13 February 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that the egg production capacity of northeast Pacific
   seabirds is reduced in years with higher spring sea-surface temperatures
   was tested with data collected on Glaucous-winged Gulls breeding on
   Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, from 2002 to 2011. The mean
   clutch size varied from 2.3 to 2.9 eggs nest(-1), but contrary to
   prediction, there was little relationship between clutch size and ocean
   temperature. In contrast, the mean egg size increased with temperature
   (opposite to the predicted decrease), but that effect was modest in size
   and limited to clutches of one and three eggs. The within-clutch
   variation in egg size differed little from year to year, and was
   unrelated to temperature. The results suggest that higher sea-surface
   temperatures do not compromise egg production in Glaucous-winged Gulls,
   a situation unlike that for some other species of marine birds on
   Triangle Island Received 6 December 2011, accepted 18 February 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Plumage dimorphism is common in the family Ardeidae with one morph
   possessing all-white plumage and the alternate morph being darkly
   colored. The effects of plumage morph and colony site on nest initiation
   date, clutch size and total nest success of the plumage dimorphic
   Reddish Egret in the Laguna Madre region of Texas were examined. Color
   morph did not significantly affect nest initiation date (Julian date -
   Dark morph: 109.88 (S.D. 26.56), White morph: 100.82 (25.85),
   Mixed-morph: 113.29 (27.55); ANOVA: F-(2.158) = 0.199, P = 0.820)
   although nest initiation date was different between nesting colonies
   (Julian date - Rabbit Island: 125.14 (S.D. 18.05); Zigzag Island: 87.15
   (19.07); ANOVA: F-(1.158) = 5.732, P = 0.018). Overall mean (+/- S.E.)
   clutch size was 3.29 +/- 0.05 and differed between colony sites but not
   between color morphs. Model selection analysis using logistic exposure
   revealed that neither plumage morph nor colony site had a significant
   effect on nest success. Mayfield total nest success was estimated at
   85.10\% +/- 5.4\% (n = 171), results which are similar to nesting
   success estimates in other heron species. The lack of effect of color
   morph on timing of nest initiation, clutch size and nest success
   suggests other factors may influence the maintenance of color dimorphism
   in Reddish Egrets. Received 21 October 2011, accepted 7 March 2012.}},

Abstract = {{To assist long-term protection of roost sites, roosting patterns of
   California Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) at San
   Nicolas Island (SNI), California, were assessed for the 1972-2006
   period. SNI was used for roosting year-round, with most birds likely
   from nearest primary, breeding colonies (Santa Barbara and Anacapa
   islands) within the Southern California Bight subpopulation. Among
   non-El Nino years, monthly diurnal counts varied, but ranged from less
   than 100 birds during the breeding season to approximately 1,000 during
   fall. Influxes from the large Gulf of California subpopulation also
   occurred on occasion, best demonstrated by prolonged increased numbers
   during strong El Nino conditions in 1972-1973, possibly reflecting
   delayed or skipped breeding and increased prey availability near the
   outer California Channel Islands. The peak estimate of 13,500
   night-roosting pelicans was on 16 November 1972 during these El Nino
   conditions. Most pelicans roosted diurnally on the north shore,
   reflecting close proximity to main foraging areas. Diurnal roost
   patterns did not appear affected by introduced feral cats (Felis catus)
   and Island Foxes (Urocyon littoralis dickeyi). The single, major night
   roost shifted 4 km from Cormorant Rock Area (used 1972-1992) to Vizcaino
   Point by 2006, following reduction of human disturbance in 1992-1996.
   Vizcaino Point and Cormorant Rock Area should be designated as ``key,
   long-semi roosts{''} that merit additional protection. Received 25 July
   2011, accepted 14 March 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative, comparative studies are needed to better orient
   conservation efforts for the endemic, threatened avifauna of the Bogota
   wetlands. The influence of landscape and local factors on abundance was
   studied for seven species: Bogota Rail (Raffia semiplumbeus) and
   Apolinar's Wren (Cistothorus apolinari), endemic species; Ruddy Duck
   (Oxyura jamaicensis), Spot-flanked Gallinula (Gallinula melanops),
   American Coot (Fulica americana) and Yellow-hooded Blackbird (Chrysomus
   icterocephalus) with endemic subspecies; and the widespread Common
   Gallinule (Gallinula galeata). Areas, habitats and landscapes of nine
   urban and ten rural wetlands were quantified using GIS and remote sensor
   images; water quality and abundances of feral dogs and Shiny Cowbirds
   (Molothrus bonariensis) were evaluated in adjunct. studies. Populations
   of focal species were estimated by point counts. Wetland variables were
   analyzed with principal component, canonical correlation and redundancy
   analyses and related to bird abundances and densities by multiple
   regressions. Most urban wetlands were covered by aquatic vegetation;
   rural wetlands were mostly open water with less vegetation. Abundances
   of all focal species increased with wetland area. Abundances of the
   endemic rail, wren and blackbird were correlated with emergent
   vegetation area and/or negatively with open water, whereas duck, coot
   and gallinule abundances were correlated with open water area and/or
   negatively with urbanized landscapes, therefore both urban and rural
   wetlands are necessary for conservation of this endemic avifauna. Public
   investment has favored only some urban wetlands hence a regional, rather
   than local, approach to wetland management is needed. The situation of
   the wren is especially critical, probably clue to brood parasitism by
   the cowbird. Received 2 October 2011, accepted 13 February 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The range and natural history of Neotropical rails are little
   understood. Observations are presented on the range, diet and breeding
   of seven poorly known rails amassed during 15 years of intensive
   fieldwork in Brazil and visits to dozens of ornithological collections:
   Amaurolimnas concolor, Neocrex erythrops, Micropygia schomburgkii,
   Gallinula melanops, Porphyrio flavirostris, Laterallus exilis and
   Pardirallus maculatus. The proposed disjunctions in some species ranges
   between the humid forests of Central America/northern South America and
   those in eastern Brazil are an artifact due to the natural scarcity of
   some species in the drier formations of central South America as well as
   to incomplete sampling. Received 19 April 2012, accepted 19 June 2012.}},

Abstract = {{A difficulty in the study of monomorphic species is the inability of
   observers to visually distinguish females from males. Based on a sample
   of 745 known-sex birds nesting at Bird Island, MA, USA, a discriminant
   function analysis (DFA) was used to sex Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii)
   of the Northwest Atlantic population using morphological measurements.
   DFA using only the total length of the head (including the bill)
   correctly identified the sex of approximately 86\% of the terns, which
   increased to 88\% if both members of a pair were measured. Including
   additional measurements increased these percentages slightly, to 87\%
   and 90\%, respectively. These levels of accuracy are generally higher
   than those reported for other species of terns. Because female-female
   pairs are frequent in this population, one cannot assume that the member
   of a pair with the larger head is a male, and additional discriminant
   functions were developed to help separate female-female from male-female
   pairs. Received 29 August 2011, accepted 9 April 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining appropriate developmental temperatures during avian
   incubation is costly to the parents, so embryos may experience
   pronounced variations in temperature that can lead to embryo mortality
   and extended incubation periods, or that could affect the offspring
   phenotype in several bird species. The egg temperatures (N = 28 eggs) of
   free-living Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) were recorded
   in a breeding colony in Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina. Three
   nests had atypical incubation patterns. Two nests experienced high
   temperature drops (average = 11.7 degrees C, minimum = 6.5 degrees C,
   duration = 9 h) and another nest had a broad daily temperature range
   (max-min), i.e. 13.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C for the first egg and 14.1 +/-
   0.8 degrees C for the second egg (range = 8-22 degrees C during egg
   laying and 18-37 degrees C during advanced incubation). Thermal
   anomalies during incubation did not affect the embryonic viability,
   hatchling mass or fledging success. The survival of embryos despite
   these atypical incubation patterns may be an adaptive mechanism during
   the harsh weather conditions normally experienced by eggs throughout
   incubation. Received 1 April 2012, accepted 16 June 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the intestinal microflora of Common Terns (Sterna
   hirundo) and their capacity to disseminate human gastrointestinal
   pathogens along migratory flyways. Common Tern chicks on Pettit Island
   in Barnegat Bay, New jersey, USA, were evaluated for carriage of
   bacterial and protozoan pathogens. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were
   taken for culture-based detection of bacterial gastrointestinal
   pathogens during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons. Bulk fecal samples
   were also taken during the 2010 nesting season to determine
   Cryptosporidium oocyst loads. Of 125 birds sampled in 2009, none carried
   Salmonella and only one carried Campylobacter. Moreover, the majority of
   birds sampled in the 2009 breeding season carried Escherichia colt and
   Klebsiella ozaenae, members of bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae. In
   2010, one of the 54 birds sampled carried Salmonella and none had
   Campylobacter in their intestines. Similar to the birds sampled in 2009,
   the 2010 cohort showed relatively high carriage of E. coli and K.
   ozaenae. Microscopic examination of fecal smears obtained in 2010
   revealed that 39 of 54 Common Tern chicks had microscopic structures
   consistent with Cryptosporidium oocysts in their intestines. These data
   indicate that Common Tern chicks in Barnegat Bay present low to no
   threat to public health through the spread of human gastrointestinal
   pathogens. Received 27 Jauntily 2012, accepted 8 May 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Point-count surveys of Black Terns ( Chlidonias niger surinamensis) were
   conducted in Wisconsin from 1980 to 2011 to assess statewide population
   trends of this declining species. The survey program consisted of 19
   roadside transects, each with 15 stops (N = 285 stops total), spread
   across 15 counties throughout the state. Surveys were conducted at the
   saute sites each year during three periods (1980-1982, 1995-1997,
   2009-2011) by observers who visited each site once during the breeding
   season (25 May to 24 June) and counted the number of Black Terns seen
   during a 5-min interval. Over the three survey periods, statistically
   significant changes in abundance occurred on 14 of the 19 transects,
   most of which either were linear or exponential declines; no significant
   increases were evident. Survey-wide, the population declined in
   abundance by nearly 70\% over the past 30 years and site occupancy
   declined by a similar percentage. Complete extirpation was recorded on
   four transects. Nest counts in two intensive study areas were consistent
   with the declining trend indicated by the point-count surveys. Likely
   causes of the decline include continued loss and degradation of breeding
   habitat and low annual adult survival probability, the latter for which
   reasons currently are unknown. Protection of remaining breeding colonies
   and restoration of degraded wetlands are recommended conservation
   measures for this species in Wisconsin and elsewhere. Received 26
   October 2011, accepted 20 January 2012.}},

Abstract = {{The status of Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) breeding in Canada is
   presented, with abundance trends in regions where data allow. Large
   (>12,000 pairs) concentrations of Common Terns nested in coastal
   Newfoundland, along the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of New Brunswick, and
   in lakes Winnipeg, Winnipegosis and Manitoba in Manitoba. Nest numbers
   increased in the four provinces of Atlantic Canada (+31\%; 1973-2010),
   the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve Canada (MANPRC) in the Gulf
   of St. Lawrence (+81\%; 1986-2009) and possibly in Great Slave Lake
   (+10\%; 1988-2010). Nest numbers declined (-41\%; 1976-2009) in Canadian
   waters of the North American Great Lakes. Based on recent census data
   (1999-2010), the number of Common Terns breeding in Canada was estimated
   at between 82,000-89,500 pairs, with possibly thousands of additional
   pairs elsewhere in Canada that have never been systematically censused:
   Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, inland areas of eastern provinces and
   the boreal forest. Recommendations are that Common Terns be censused in
   these areas with protocols established for the Great Lakes and annual
   management be implemented at sites on the Great Lakes earlier identified
   as ``high priority{''}. Adoption of these recommendations would achieve
   better understanding of national abundance trends and inform future
   conservation initiatives. Received 29 July 2011, accepted 12 December

Abstract = {{A decrease in wetland habitats throughout North America has caused a
   decline in populations of marsh birds. The objective of this study was
   to estimate population densities and abundances of secretive marsh birds
   in Iowa. Call-broadcast surveys were conducted in conjunction with
   distance sampling for eight species of marsh birds at wetlands in three
   regions of Iowa during 2009 and 2010. Regions were defined by observed
   microhabitat characteristics which also corresponded to physiographic
   regions. Region-specific density estimates were obtained using Program
   Distance for four species of marsh birds for which sufficient detections
   existed (Pied-billed Grebe {[}Podilymbus podiceps], Least Bittern
   {[}Ixobtychus exilis], Virginia Rail {[}Rallus limicola] and Sora
   {[}Porzana carolina]). The range of density estimates was 0.019 birds/ha
   (95\% CI = 0.014-0.024) for Least Bittern to 0.12 birds/ha (95\% CI =
   0.11-0.14) for Pied-billed Grebe. Density estimates were highest in
   Region 2 for Pied-billed Grebe, Region 1 for Virginia Rail, and Region 3
   for Sora. Least Bittern density was similar between Regions 1 and 2, but
   was 0.027 birds/ha lower in Region 3. The need to focus conservation
   efforts on areas of the state where large amounts of suitable habitat
   exist and marsh bird densities are highest is illustrated by the
   observed differences in species' densities across regions. Information
   on the current population status of marsh birds in Iowa and regions
   where conservation efforts can be directed are provided by these density
   estimates. Received 31 May 2011, accepted 19 November 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland-dependent birds are considered to be at particularly high risk
   for negative climate change effects. Current and future distributions of
   American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), American Coot (Fulica
   americana), Black Tern (Chlidonias niger), Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus
   podiceps) and Sora (Porzana carolina), five waterbird species common in
   the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), were predicted using species
   distribution models (SDMs) in combination with climate data that
   projected a drier future for the PPR. Regional-scale SDMs were created
   for the U.S. PPR using breeding bird survey occurrence records for
   1971-2000 and wetland and climate parameters. For each waterbird
   species, current distribution and four potential future distributions
   were predicted: all combinations of two Global Circulation Models and
   two emissions scenarios. Averaged for all five species, the ensemble
   range reduction was 64\%. However, projected range losses for individual
   species varied widely with Sora and Black Tern projected to lose close
   to 100\% and American Bittern 29\% of their current range. Future
   distributions were also projected to a hypothetical landscape where
   wetlands were numerous and constant to highlight areas suitable as
   conservation reserves under a drier future climate. The ensemble model
   indicated that northeastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota would be
   the best areas for conservation reserves within the U.S. PPR under the
   modeled conditions. Received 1 August 2011, accepted 23 January 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Red-legged Cormorants (Phalacrocorax gaimardi) breed along a broad
   stretch of the Pacific coast and a section of the Argentinian coast on
   the Atlantic Ocean. To understand factors that might determine the
   breeding range along Argentina, physical and environmental
   characteristics of cuffed coastlines used by Red-legged Cormorants were
   compared with those not used. Red-legged Cormorant colonies were found
   in longer cuffed coastlines (mostly longer than 250 m) with shallow
   waters (median depth =12 in) and high sea productivity close to the
   coast (median chlorophyll a concentration = 4.4 mg/m(3)). Within the
   Red-legged Cormorants' breeding range the probability of occurrence of
   their colonies increased with the length of the cliffed coastline and
   decreased with the median sea depth around the colony. Mixed colonies
   were found in coastal areas with cliffs where the seawater close to
   shore was deeper (deeper than = 13 m). North of its distribution, sea
   productivity close to the coast was lower (median chlorophyll a
   concentration = 1.6 mg/m(3)) than within its distribution, and cliff
   faces were more exposed to the strong prevailing winds, which can blow
   eggs and chicks from their nests. South of its distribution, the
   climatic characteristics were more adverse to breeding success: higher
   precipitation, lower ambient temperature, and higher wind speed than
   within its distribution. At this scale of study (regional), new aspects
   of habitat structure of the Red-legged Cormorant, such as sea primary
   production, water depths and climatic features, were indentified. All
   these aspects could be affecting habitat selections by this species.

Abstract = {{Data on the movement of immature Eurasian Spoonbills from the southern
   Pannonian Basin are presented for the first time and differences in
   migration patterns between the Atlantic and southern Pannonian breeding
   populations are identified. Movements of spoonbills from Western Europe
   are well known, but there is uncertainty about the movements of the
   eastern metapopulation, of which the southern Pannonian population forms
   part. Analyses were based on 707 resightings in Europe and North Africa
   of 272 color-ringed birds. The studied birds wintered in North Africa
   (predominantly Tunisia) or southern Italy (Sicily and Sardinia). Most
   birds used the central Mediterranean flyway, but crossed the Adriatic
   Sea at more northern latitudes than had previously been reported. With
   increase in age, the ratio of birds spending the breeding period at the
   wintering sites decreased (54.2\% for second-year and 13.6\% for
   third-year birds), while the ratio of those returning to the Pannonian
   breeding grounds increased (37.5\% and 66.6\% respectively). Older
   spoonbills arrived back at their natal areas earlier Immature spoonbills
   from the southern Pannonian Basin population visited breeding colonies
   in Germany, confirming at least sporadic contacts between two
   metapopulations. Identification of migration routes and wintering areas
   is a major precondition for the conservation of the eastern
   metapopulation. Illegal hunting, tourism development on staging areas
   and lack of suitable feeding habitats along flyway have been identified
   as the most important threats. Received 6 July 2011, accepted 10 April

Abstract = {{Foraging trip duration of breeding seabirds is affected by
   characteristics of available feeding habitat in the marine environment,
   which may, in turn, generate inter-colony difference in the patterns of
   nest attendance. Here, nest attendance patterns and foraging areas of
   Streaked Shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) during their incubation
   period were examined using global location sensors. The study was
   conducted at Sangan (SI) and Mikura Islands (MI) in the northwestern
   Pacific, and Awa Island (AI) in the Japan Sea during 2006-2009. The
   duration of incubation shifts showed significant inter-colony
   difference, but no sex-related difference. Shearwaters from SI had
   shorter mean incubation shifts (5.6 days on average; range 3.0-8.0 days)
   than those from MI (7.2 days; range 4.8-10.7 days) and AI (6.9 days;
   range 6.0-9.7 days). During the incubation period, SI and MI shearwaters
   foraged in the northwestern Pacific's Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area,
   while shearwaters from AI mostly foraged in the Japan Sea. The
   Northwestern Pacific represents a high-productivity zone, and SI
   shearwaters appeared to forage in these waters, where foraging
   efficiency is potentially high, leading to shorter incubation shifts.
   Also, although MI shearwaters foraged in the northwestern Pacific, the
   distance between their colony and foraging areas was greater (645 km on
   average; range 546-756 km), compared to SI (272 km; range 244-297 km)
   and AI birds (228 km; range 75-518 km). In this study, inter-colony
   differences in incubation shift length of Streaked Shearwaters appeared
   to be related to differences in foraging areas associated with the local
   marine environment. Received 3 July 2011, accepted 17 January, 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Previous Mottled Duck (Anas fulvigula) studies suggested that high
   female breeding season survival may be caused by low nesting effort, but
   few breeding season estimates of survival associated with nesting effort
   exist on the western Gulf Coast. Here, breeding season survival (N = 40)
   and breeding incidence (N = 39) were estimated for female Mottled Ducks
   on the upper Texas coast, 2006-2008. Females were fitted with backpack
   radio transmitters and visually relocated every 3-4 days. Weekly
   survival was estimated using the Known Fate procedure of program MARK
   with breeding incidence estimated as the annual proportion of females
   observed nesting or with broods. The top-ranked survival model included
   a body mass covariate and held weekly female survival constant across
   weeks and years (S-w = 0.986, SE = 0.006). When compared to survival
   across the entire year estimated from previous band recovery and age
   ratio analysis, survival rate during the breeding season did not differ.
   Breeding incidence was well below 100\% in all years and highly variable
   among years (15\%-63\%). Breeding season survival and breeding incidence
   were similar to estimates obtained with implant transmitters from the
   mid-coast of Texas. The greatest breeding incidence for both studies
   occurred when drought indices indicated average environmental moisture
   during the breeding season. The observed combination of low breeding
   incidence and high breeding season survival support the hypothesis of a
   trade-off between the ecological cost of nesting effort and survival for
   Mottled Duck females. Habitat cues that trigger nesting are unknown and
   should be investigated. Received 18 September 2010, accepted 24 March
   2012.}},

Abstract = {{Little has been documented on large (> 250 g), water-associated birds in
   the north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, that nest colonially and
   rely on suitable sites for breeding. The purpose of this study was to
   highlight these species and the importance of nesting sites for their
   effective conservation management. From 19202010, there were 622 records
   of 27 of these species breeding at more than 48 sites. Five sites
   accounted for 65\% of these breeding events, four at Lake St Lucia,
   highlighting its importance for bird conservation. Several sites were
   abandoned. However, two new sites have established more recently (Nsumo
   Pan, Mkhuze Game Reserve; Nyamithi Pan, Ndumo Game Reserve) that are
   important in terms of number of individuals as well as variety of
   species. Some species (Pink-backed Pelican Pelecanus rufescens,
   Grey-headed Gull Larus cirrocephalus, Caspian Tern Sterna caspia,
   Great-white Pelican P. onocrotalus and African Spoonbill Platalea alba)
   have bred regularly but have used only a few sites, mainly at Lake St
   Lucia. Two species (Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus and Black Heron
   Egretta ardesiaca) have bred once only on Lane Island (1961) and in
   trees at the mouth of the Hluhluwe River (before 1964) respectively. Two
   colonial sites hosted 10-12 species while others (n = 8) only two.
   Twenty-one sites were used by only one species. Two species (Pink-backed
   Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork Mycteria ibis) nest nowhere else in
   South Africa on a regular basis. Recommendations for the ongoing
   monitoring and conservation of these colonially-nesting birds in the
   region, particularly in terms of securing these sites, are made.

Abstract = {{Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) foraging flight studies at 20+ colonies
   throughout the US range were reviewed to summarize foraging ranges and
   compared to 20, 25 and 30 km-wide regulatory buffers ({''}core foraging
   areas{''}) created to provide sufficient foraging habitats for breeding
   storks. Mean (per colony) direct distances to foraging sites ranged from
   2.7 to 18.1 km, and between 75-100\% of all follow flights went to
   foraging sites within 20 km of their colony. Overall, reviewed follow
   flight data suggested that the 20-km buffer would be sufficient for all
   breeding colonies in the US. However, such a reduction is not supported
   at this time due to limited recent data for certain regions of the Wood
   Stork breeding range (e.g. central and southern Florida). Additional,
   preferably multi-year, foraging habitat use studies are needed to fill
   data gaps for these areas to better assess the validity of the CFA
   buffers. Received 22 August 2011, accepted 1 December 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Winter foraging ecology of Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), Long-billed
   Curlew (Numenius americanus), Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and Willet
   (Tringa semipalmata) was studied in relation to conspecific density at
   Estero de Urias, a tropical coastal lagoon in northwestern Mexico.
   Specifically, the effect of ecological factors in relation to individual
   prey capture rates for Marbled Godwits and both Numenius spp. was
   examined. There was a consistent, inverse relationship between
   conspecific density and foraging activity, but the slope differed among
   species. The inverse relationship suggests that conspecific density was
   an important determinant of individual foraging behavior and habitat use
   across species. For Marbled Godwits, prey capture rate was positively
   correlated with conspecific density and water depth, but negatively
   correlated with tidal height, at least during spring tides. In contrast,
   for both Numenius spp., prey capture rate was significantly higher for
   territorial birds and tactile foragers, in the case of Curlews, but was
   independent of tidal conditions. When neap tides resulted in reduced
   foraging time budget, Marbled Godwits increased prey capture rate, but
   Numenius spp., did not. Differences in foraging mode, availability of
   preferred prey in relation to water depth, as well as handling time of
   prey, could drive these distinct patterns between godwits and both
   Numenius spp. These results support suggestions that the increased
   conspecific density during periods of neap tides might explain the
   reduced prey capture rate of individuals with less competitive ability,
   especially within large shorebirds showing a sparse foraging
   distribution. Received 22 June 2011, accepted 30 January 2012.}},

   characteristics related to the shape of the foraging path and activity
   (flying, resting or diving). Forty-six Imperial Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax atriceps), 18 males and 28 females breeding at Punta
   Leon, Argentina (43 degrees 04'S; 64 degrees 2'W), were fitted with GPS
   loggers recording one foraging trip (sampling interval: 1 second) in
   2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008. Trip duration was longer, on average, for
   females (6.3 +/- 1.9 h) than males (5.3 +/- 1.6 h) (Mann-Whitney U test
   z 1,45 = 2.23, P = 0.026), but year had no significant effect on any of
   the path characteristics. ARS was detected in 43 individuals, 22 of
   which made smaller-scaled searches nested within larger ARS areas.
   Search scale was not correlated to maximum distance reached and did not
   differ between sexes nor years. Cluster analysis separated four types of
   behavior: short direct return trips (N = 7), long direct return trips (N
   = 31), random flight searches (N = 6) and loops (N = 2), with each
   behavioral type present in both sexes. Behavioral variability within a
   population may be due to differences in targeted prey type and
   spatio-temporal stability during the season, as well as to individual
   physiological constraints and life-history traits linked to how
   individuals search for food at sea. Received 8 June 2017, accepted 28
   October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The application of stable-isotope analysis (SIA) in ecology has
   increased exponentially in the last 20 years. As with any novel field of
   inquiry, there has been inconsistent (and sometimes confusing) use of
   terminology and great variation in how the results of SIA are presented
   in the scientific literature. Recently, guidelines and recommendations
   for the consistent use of terminology, the expression of results, and
   presentation of symbols were prepared and published at the request of
   the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW) of the
   International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Here, key
   components of the CIAAW recommendations pertinent to ecologists are
   summarized, along with suggestions for best practices in reporting
   results of SIA not covered by the CIAAW guidelines. A set of universally
   adopted and consistently used terminology and practices will minimize
   ambiguity, especially in the overlap of different fields, such as
   analytical chemistry and ecology. Received 17 January 2012, accepted 7
   March 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the sex of Crab Plovers (Dromas ardeola) based on morphology
   has, hitherto, proven difficult. Here, six morphological traits
   (head-bill length, bill length, bill depth, wing chord, tarsus length
   and weight) of 39 molecularly or behaviorally sexed breeding Crab
   Plovers were compared in order to find a reliable morphometric way to
   determine their sex. Males were significantly larger than females in all
   traits, except tarsus length, and especially in traits related to head
   and bill size, where males were 6.8 to 11.4\% larger than females.
   Discriminant Function Analysis correctly classified 97.4\% of birds
   using only bill depth and bill length, providing an efficient tool for
   sexing Crab Plovers in the hand. Received 19 October 2011, accepted 20

Abstract = {{Cannibalism has never been documented in any species of cormorant. While
   conducting a study on the Socotra Cormorant (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis)
   colony of Siniya Island, Umm Al Quwain, United Arab Emirates, several
   instances of heterocannibalism were observed and photographed during
   October-December 2011. Older fledgling chicks were observed consuming
   younger altricial chicks. Such behavior may be clue to a period of
   forced starvation, caused by abandonment by the parents in the third
   creching stage. The frequency of observed events suggests that this
   behavior may be common in Socotra Cormorants and should be investigated
   to determine possible causes and effects on the conservation of the
   species. Received 24 January 2012, accepted 7 April 2012.}},

Pages = {{342-346}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Several methods exist to capture ground-nesting birds, yet questions
   remain concerning their effectiveness, cost and safety. An experiment
   was conducted comparing traps commonly used to capture ground-nesting
   shorebirds. Data were collected on Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus)
   nesting at Great Salt Lake, Utah during the 2009 breeding season. The
   three most common traps used to capture nesting Snowy Plovers (spring
   trap, walk-in funnel trap, leg-hold noose mats) were compared in the
   time required to use the trap (e.g. time to install at nest), capture
   success and construction costs. These results indicated that the funnel
   trap had the lowest total time at the nest (P < 0.01) and per trapping
   attempt, highest capture rate, fewest failed set up attempts, low
   disturbance to the nest site and was the least expensive to build. Based
   on these findings, the funnel trap should allow avian researchers to
   maximize their time, resources and efforts when trapping ground-nesting
   shorebirds. Received 7 November 2011, accepted 2 March 2012.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{347-351}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the United States, the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) is
   a federally endangered species and restricted to the wetlands of
   south-central Florida where the current population numbers less than
   1,500. The Snail Kite is an extreme dietary specialist, previously
   feeding almost exclusively on one species of snail, the Florida Apple
   Snail (Panacea paludosa). Within the past decade, an exotic species of
   apple snail, the Island Apple Snail (Panacea insularum), has become
   established on lakes in central Florida. Island Apple Snails are larger
   than the native Florida Apple Snails, and Snail Kites handle the exotic
   snails less efficiently. juvenile Snail Kites, in particular, have lower
   daily energy balances while feeding on Island Apple Snails. An
   inexpensive, easy-to-construct platform was developed that would provide
   Snail Kites with a flat, stable surface on which to extract snails. The
   platform has the potential to reduce the difficulties Snail Kites
   experience when handling exotic snails, and may benefit the Snail Kite
   population as a whole. Initial observations indicate that Snail Kites
   use the platforms frequently, and snails extracted at the platforms are
   larger than snails extracted at other perches. Received 30 August 2011,
   accepted 14 January 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) may be one of the rarest shorebirds
   in North America yet a comprehensive assessment of their abundance and
   distribution has not been completed. During 2007 and 2008, 557 discrete
   wetlands were surveyed and nine additional large wetland complexes
   sampled in Mexico and the USA. From these surveys, a population of
   23,555 (95\% CI = 17,299 - 29,859) breeding Snowy Plovers was estimated.
   Combining the estimate with information from areas not surveyed, the
   total North American population was assessed at 25,869 (95\% CI = 18,917
   - 32,173). Approximately 42\% of all breeding Snowy Plovers in North
   America resided at two sites (Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Salt Plains
   National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma), and 33\% of all these were on
   wetlands in the Great Basin (including Great Salt Lake). Also, coastal
   habitats in central and southern Texas supported large numbers of
   breeding plovers. New breeding sites were discovered in interior deserts
   and highlands and along the Pacific coast of Mexico; approximately 9\%
   of the North American breeding population occurred in Mexico. Because of
   uncertainties about effects of climate change and current stresses to
   breeding habitats, the species should be a management and conservation
   priority. Periodic monitoring should be undertaken at important sites to
   ensure high quality habitat is available to support the Snowy Plover
   population. Received 22 July 2011, accepted 18 October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Shorebirds are thought to be declining across North America but trend
   analyses for migrant shorebirds at interior sites in eastern North
   America have not been updated since the late 1990s. Data from a
   volunteer-based survey at stopover sites throughout Ontario were used to
   assess population trends of shorebirds over the period 1974-2009.
   Surveyors carried out 7,135 surveys of 258 sites and recorded 538,744
   individuals of 43 shorebird species. Of 19 taxa for which trends were
   estimated, 17 appeared to be declining in abundance. Precision of the
   trend estimates was generally poor and only three declines Were
   significant alpha = 0.05. Total numbers of shorebirds recorded on
   surveys declined by four per cent per year, resulting in an estimated
   decrease in abundance of greater than 75\% over the 35 years of
   observation. Rate of decline may be increasing for some species as
   declines for twelve species were larger for the period 1989-2009 vs.
   1974-1989, and six species showed significant declines in the latter
   period whereas none did in the former period. Relating these declines in
   abundance at the surveyed sites to population declines is complicated
   by, several potential sources of survey bias including changes in
   turnover rates and in migration timing and distributions of the species.
   However, given that these results are consistent with those of other
   migration surveys as well as those on the breeding and the wintering
   grounds, the most parsimonious explanation remains a widespread decline
   in shorebird populations. Received 26 April 2011, accepted 19 November
   2011.}},

Abstract = {{Colony size, nesting ecology and diet of Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne
   caspia) were investigated in the San Francisco Bay area (SFBA) during
   2003-2009 to assess the potential for conservation of the tern breeding
   population and possible negative effects of predation on survival of
   juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.). Numbers of breeding Caspian
   Terns declined 36\% from 2003 to 2009, mostly due to abandonment of the
   Knight Island colony and decline of the Brooks Island colony, the two
   largest colonies in the SFBA. Concurrently, nesting success declined
   69\% associated with colony site characteristics such as (a) quality and
   quantity of nesting substrate, (b) vulnerability to nest predators, (c)
   displacement by other colonial waterbirds and (d) human disturbance.
   Marine fishes were the predominant prey in tern diets from the SFBA;
   however, diet composition varied among colonies. Juvenile salmonids
   comprised 22.9\% of the diet of terns nesting in the North Bay, 5.3\% of
   diet of terns nesting in the Central Bay, and 0.1\% in the South Bay.
   Construction or restoration of nesting islands in the South Bay may help
   maintain and restore breeding Caspian Terns without enhancing mortality
   of salmonid stocks of conservation concern. Received 8 February 2011,
   accepted 18 October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Great Egret (Ardea alba) and Cocoi Heron (A. cocoi) have a wide
   distribution in the neotropics but few data on reproductive biology for
   these species are available. The reproductive parameters, growth rate
   and diet of chicks of egret and heron in a mixed-species colony nesting
   were studied during the 2007 breeding season in a pampas wetland of
   Argentina, with 50 and 17 nests studied, respectively. Mean egret clutch
   size was 3.6 +/- 0.5 eggs and hatching success 76\%. Mean heron clutch
   size was 3.5 +/- 0.8 eggs and hatching success 81\%. The mean number of
   fledged egrets/egg was 0.15 and productivity 0.54 chicks per nest; for
   herons reproductive success and productivity were 0.17 and 0.58,
   respectively. In both species, the most productive clutch size was
   three. The first two weeks post-hatching were critical for chick
   survival. In egrets, the last chick to hatch had lower growth rates than
   the first or second hatched chicks; however in herons the first chick to
   hatch had higher growth rates than the second or third hatched chicks.
   Fish and insects were the main prey of egret chicks, while mammals and
   fish were the most common prey of heron chicks. Starvation was the main
   factor causing the relatively low breeding performance observed in both
   species. Received 11 March 2011, accepted 3 October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate water-level manipulations as a management tool in boreal
   wetlands, marsh bird and waterfowl habitat use were studied in the
   Saskatchewan River Delta, Manitoba, Canada, during 2008 and 2009.
   Call-response and aerial surveys were used to estimate densities of
   marsh birds and waterfowl, respectively; within six wetland basins
   undergoing two different water-level treatments. Generalized linear
   models were used to determine relationships between presence and
   densities of birds to water depth, vegetation characteristics, and
   relative forage fish and invertebrate abundances at two spatial scales.
   American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and Pied-billed Grebe
   (Podilymbus podiceps) densities were positively influenced by water
   depth and relative fish abundance. American Coots (Fulica americana) and
   diver waterfowl (Aythya, Bucephala) also responded positively to
   increased water depth, whereas dabbler waterfowl (Anas, Aix) were
   negatively influenced by increasing water depth. Densities of Sora
   (Porzana carolina) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) were positively
   correlated with the relative abundances of invertebrates, but negatively
   correlated with relative fish abundance. Due to the high avian
   biodiversity in the region, managers should focus on providing a variety
   of wetland habitats. Using a combination of partial water-level
   drawdowns and high water, habitat for numerous avian species can be
   created simultaneously within wetland complexes. Received 23 March 2011,
   accepted 24 November 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of large Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) breeding
   colonies in upland residential areas of east central Texas has been
   observed since the early 1960s. To help understand why Cattle Egrets
   choose residential breeding sites and predict where these might occur in
   the future, the geographic extent and scale-dependent nature of the
   phenomenon was investigated. In east Texas and along the Texas Gulf
   Coast, Cattle Egret colonies were found in flooded forests or on
   islands. However, in east central Texas, colonies were often located in
   upland areas. A habitat suitability model was constructed at multiple
   scales, outlining land use classes thought to influence upland colony
   site selection: water, forest and development/residential. The model
   classified 79\% of upland colony locations in high or very highly
   suitable habitat and 7\% in low or very low suitable habitat. The
   distribution of classes was significantly different than expected
   considering the distribution of land cover suitability classes across
   the entire study area (p = 0.036). Cattle Egrets likely choose upland,
   residential sites to breed when suitable wetland habitats are limited.
   When flooded tree and shrub or island habitats are absent, egrets may
   choose the edges of development for breeding sites to limit potential
   disturbance from ground predators. Received 12 April 2011, accepted 3
   October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Two specimens of adult Crested Auk let (Aethia cristatella) have been
   taken at sea in the North Atlantic Ocean: (1) near Iceland in August
   1912 and (2) near Nuuk (formerly Godthab), southwest Greenland between
   1986 and 1972. An adult Parakeet Anklet (A. psittacula) was taken at
   Lake Vattern, Sweden in December 1860. These rare inter-ocean vagrants
   probably traveled from the Chukchi Sea east through the Canadian Arctic
   Archipelago to the Atlantic Ocean and may have arrived long before they
   were collected. Breeding distributions, limited post-breeding movements,
   weather patterns, timing and plumage of Atlantic and Pacific vagrants,
   small number of Atlantic vagrant records and the lack of inland records
   of these species east of Alaska in North America, support this route.
   Information about rare occurrences of anklets in the Atlantic Ocean
   enhances our knowledge of overall patterns of rare long-distance
   vagrancy versus more frequent vagrancy in alcids and other seabirds.

Abstract = {{Over 16 field seasons, between 1981 and 2006, nearly 20,000 migrant
   Semipalmated Sandpipers were captured, weighed, and their bills and
   wings measured during the fall stopover in the Bay of Fundy. Annual mean
   bill and wing lengths declined over the course of the study. As eastern
   Semipalmated Sandpipers have longer bills and wings than those from the
   west, we interpret the decline to be the result of a reduced proportion
   of eastern birds in our samples. Semipalmated Sandpiper populations are
   in decline in North America, and our data suggest that the decline may
   be more severe in the eastern part of their breeding range. Body mass
   and size-adjusted mass at the migratory stopover study site have not
   declined during the study, suggesting that feeding conditions have not
   deteriorated there. Possibly, differing conditions experienced on the
   breeding grounds or overwintering areas may explain why eastern
   populations of Semipalmated Sandpipers may be declining more severely
   than those from the west. Received 15 November 2010, accepted 2 December
   2011.}},

Abstract = {{The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) is a small, abundant
   shorebird that breeds primarily in sub-Arctic to mid-Arctic habitats
   across the Nearctic and winters principally along the northern and
   central coasts of South America. No subspecies have been described and
   little is known concerning their genetics. However, birds show a cline
   in bill length across the Arctic, with longest bills in the east and
   shortest in the west. There appear to be several `steps' in the cline,
   suggesting a division into eastern, central and western breeding
   populations. Since females average longer bills than males in a breeding
   population, there is considerable overlap of bill lengths at migration
   staging areas. Based on bill length patterns and sightings and
   recoveries of marked individuals, most western breeders migrate south
   through the prairies, along with some birds from central Arctic
   populations. The remaining central Arctic breeders, and all eastern
   Arctic birds, migrate south through the north Atlantic Coast of North
   America, particularly the Bay of Fundy. Western Arctic breeders appear
   to winter farther west in South America than eastern breeders, although
   there is considerable mixing among populations in French Guiana and
   Guyana. In spring, birds from the eastern Arctic migrate north through
   the U.S. Atlantic coast, including Delaware Bay. Central and western
   Arctic breeders primarily migrate north through the interior of North
   America. Therefore, central Arctic breeders in particular demonstrate an
   elliptical migration pattern. Received 27 December 2010, accepted 2
   December 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Although Semipalmated Sandpipers are one of the most common shorebirds
   in North America, analyses of migration trends using data from the
   Maritimes, International and Ontario Shorebird Surveys, as well as the
   Quebec Checklist, collected between 1974-1998, consistently showed
   negative trends. An additional eleven years of data was assessed to
   determine if declines were ongoing. Analysis (Pearson correlation) of
   the Quebec Checklist data indicated a significant decline overall, from
   1976 to 2008, and the percentage of checklists reporting flocks of
   >1,000 birds has decreased significantly since the 1970s. New analyses
   of population trends with migration monitoring data from eastern and
   central North America were conducted for the 35-year period from 1974 to
   2009, using program ESTEQNINDEXE. Trends, although generally negative,
   were not statistically significant. In the North Atlantic region, where
   survey sites had the highest counts of Semipalmated Sandpipers, average
   abundance indices showed a pronounced decrease between 1985 and 1999 and
   an increase since then. Although the trend was not statistically
   significant, declines in Ontario amounted to an estimated 8\% per year
   from 1974 to 2009. Counts were variable for Semipalmated Sandpipers in
   the Midcontinent region, although average abundance indices appeared
   lower in the second half of the analysis period (1989-2009). Thus, the
   population status of Semipalmated Sandpipers in North America may have
   improved since the 1990s, at least in the east. Received 8 July 2011,
   accepted 2 December 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) at some migratory
   stopover sites have shown pronounced declines over the last 35 years.
   Counts from breeding grounds avoid sources of bias that have proven
   troublesome for trends estimated from migration surveys. Published and
   unpublished data were reviewed to examine trends in densities of
   Semipalmated Sandpipers at breeding sites across Alaska and arctic
   Canada. Information was sparse, and some comparisons are tenuous because
   methods varied over time. Valid time series were obtained for 13 sites
   across the species' range. In Alaska, Semipalmated Sandpipers either
   increased or were at least stable at six sites and decreased at one
   site. Surveys at both sites in the central portion of the range
   suggested no change in abundance. In the eastern portion of the range,
   trends were variable: decreases were observed at two sites, a possible
   increase at one site, and no change at another. Thus, the species was
   generally increasing or stable in the western and central portions of
   the range and had an uncertain status in the east. Also, trends in
   presence/absence data were analyzed from the Northwest Territories and
   Nunavut Checklist Survey. The species was observed at 345 sites, and
   results suggested that birds increased significantly in prevalence
   (assumed here to be correlated with abundance) across arctic Canada
   between 1987 and 2007. Overall, data from the breeding grounds do not
   support a range-wide decline in the abundance of Semipalmated
   Sandpipers, although data are insufficient for the long-billed
   population from the eastern Arctic for which specific conservation
   concerns exist. Received 1 1 July 2011, accepted 2 December 2011.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1980's, aerial surveys in South America established that the main
   wintering areas of Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) were found
   on the north coast of the continent, especially in the Guianas
   (Suriname, French Guiana and Guyana). Although population trend analyses
   have consistently shown declines in numbers of Semipalmated Sandpipers,
   especially for birds on migration in eastern North America, until now
   surveys had not been undertaken to determine whether such declines were
   reflected in numbers on the main wintering areas. Between December 2008
   and January 2011, aerial surveys of major wintering areas in Suriname
   (3), French Guiana (2) and Guyana (1) were carried out. Results showed
   dramatic declines, with an overall total of only 21\% of the 1980s
   total-a decrease of 79\%. A variety of reasons may have contributed to
   the declines and include habitat changes, range shifts, sustained
   hunting, or increases in predation, pollution or severe weather.

Abstract = {{Semipalmated and Least Sandpipers (Calidrispusilla, C. minutilla) were
   captured in Delaware Bay, USA, from 1995-1997 and from 2000-2008 to
   investigate changes in energetic condition during northbound migration
   staging. For Semipalmated Sandpiper, a model containing the effects of
   Julian clay, period (Early: 1995-1997, Middle: 2000-2004, Late:
   2004-2008) and habitat. type (marsh, beach), as well as all interaction
   terms for these variables (the ``full{''} model) had the strongest
   support (i.e. lowest AIC(c) score) compared to six reduced models.
   Results suggested that mean size-adjusted mass declined significantly
   across periods (Early > Middle > Late). Also, rate of increase in
   size-adjusted mass within staging periods was significantly greater
   during the Early compared to Middle and Late periods. For Least
   Sandpiper, a reduced model that included Julian clay and Period had the
   strongest support. Size-adjusted mass was significantly lower in the
   Late compared to Early and Middle periods, which were not different from
   each other. While in Delaware Bay, Semipalmatecl Sandpipers feed
   primarily on horseshoe crab eggs during episodes of rapid mass
   accumulation, but harvest pressure from 1995-2005 dramatically reduced
   egg availability. Least Sandpipers appear less dependent on this
   resource, which may explain differences between the two species
   regarding changes in energetic condition during staging periods in
   Delaware Bay. Long-term population trend indices suggest that
   Semipalmated Sandpiper has declined significantly since the 1980s,
   especially populations migrating along the Atlantic Coast en route to
   eastern Canadian breeding areas, which could be related, in part, to
   changes in food availability, in Delaware Bay. Received 26 July 2011,

Abstract = {{The diet of the Neotropical Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) was
   evaluated in the Limay River basin, a freshwater system invaded by
   exotic salmonids. Analyses of 106 pellets showed that fish were the most
   important prey (79.9\% by numerical frequency, and 86.2\% by frequency
   of occurrence), followed by two crustacean species. Among fish, the most
   common species were exotic salmonids, representing 84\% by numerical
   frequency. Morphometric comparisons enabled differentiation of sagitta
   otoliths from Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta and permitted
   determination of similar contributions of these species to the diet.
   Although a wide prey-size range was found, 85\% of fish were smaller
   than 150 trim in length. The results suggest that the Neotropical
   Cormorant has adapted to changes in the fish community: after the
   introduction of salmonids. Flexible feeding strategies of the
   Neotropical Cormorant and/or its capacity to exploit different
   environments probably make it less vulnerable to environmental changes
   produced by introduction of exotic fish. Received 21 March 2011,
   accepted 17 November 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Wading bird (Ciconiiformes) nesting success is influenced by the
   availability of aquatic prey, but principle prey may, differ among
   species. During an excellent nesting year (2009) 118 boluses Were
   collected from nestlings of three species, White Ibis (Eudocimus albus),
   Tricolored Heron (Egretta bicolor) and Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) in a
   mixed colony in the northern Everglades. Although these species have
   similar foraging depths and foraging flight distances from nesting
   colonies, crayfish dominated the ibis boluses while small-bodied fishes
   dominated egret boluses. Fish prey species composition in Snowy Egret
   and Tricolored Heron boluses did not differ. Compared to available fish
   species from nearby wetlands, the Egretta spp. did not exhibit taxonomic
   selectivity but did feed selectively on larger (2-4 cm standard length)
   fish. Whether restoration activities in the Everglades, including
   hydroperiod lengthening, will simultaneously enhance prey for both
   invertivores like White Ibis and piscivores, such as the egrets, remains
   an open question. Received 31 May 2011, accepted 27 October 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Reports of hybridization among herons are not uncommon but usually
   document interbreeding within genera and in captivity. An inter-generic
   hybrid pairing between a male Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and a
   female Chinese Pond Heron (Ardeola bacchus) was video-recorded in a
   mixed-species heronry in Japan. In June 2010, nest-building behavior and
   copulation by the interspecific pair were observed. In August 2010, a
   juvenile possessing intermediate characteristics of the two species was
   fed by the female Chinese Pond Heron. These observations indicated that
   a fertile intergeneric hybridization occurred between the two species.
   The Chinese Pond Heron is an irregular visitor to Japan, but has been
   recorded more often in recent years. A rare species such as the Chinese
   Pond Heron might choose heterospecific mates rather than abandoning all
   chances of reproduction. Received 2 October 2011, accepted 10 December

Abstract = {{Little is known about whether chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera)
   suppress or activate immunity in birds. Here, relationships between lice
   (Quadraceps punctatus, Saemundsonnia lari and Austromenopon transversum)
   and immune parameters were evaluated in Ring-billed Gull (Lams
   delawarensis) chicks. Eosinophils made up greater proportions of
   leukocytes in chicks with more lice (partial r = 0.64, P < 0.001),
   suggesting louse-induced immunoactivation via either eosinophil
   production or redistribution to peripheral blood. However, there were no
   significant relationships between lice and other immune parameters
   (proportion heterophils, proportion lymphocytes, heterophil:lymphocyte
   ratio, response to injection with phytohaemagglutinin). Collectively,
   results suggest only minor immune responses to lice, but experimental
   manipulations of louse infestations are needed to better quantify these
   responses and evaluate their potential consequences for fitness.

Abstract = {{Small off-the-shelf unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) could prove useful
   for surveying waterbirds. A low-end model was evaluated for surveying
   flocks of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) and Snow Geese (Chen
   caerulescens) by comparing photographic counts from repeated flybys to
   repeated visual ground counts. Due to low contrast of Canada Geese with
   the ground, UAS counts based on confident detections only had a lower
   mean than ground counts for five out of six flocks (>30\% lower for
   three flocks) and coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 11-106\%,
   compared to 1-6\% for ground counts. Conversely, UAS counts of
   high-contrast Snow Geese were 60\% higher on average and less variable
   (CV = 1-6\%) than ground counts (CV = 11\%). In some cases the aircraft
   likely detected birds that were not seen from the ground due to an
   obstructed view. Shortcomings of the UAS were mainly related to its
   unsophisticated imaging system compared to more expensive models.
   Otherwise, the UAS proved capable of being conveniently transported and
   deployed over flocks without causing them to flush. Further
   consideration should be given to off:the-shelf UAS for surveying
   waterbirds over small areas (<5-km radius) that are difficult to survey
   from the ground or as an option for performing low-disturbance surveys.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the second Special Publication of the Waterbird
   Society to address the biology and management of the Double-crested
   Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritius) in North America. Since the late
   1960s and early 1970s, when the species was at very low population
   levels, the Double-crested Cormorant has rebounded to its greatest
   population level in over 100 years. Such a significant increase has
   resulted in changes in community structure, and new stressors, in many
   aquatic ecosystems. Both Special Publications (1995 and 2013) have been
   focused on the biology and management of the species. The first volume
   dealt mainly with population growth and the resulting, immediate
   management issues. In the current volume, studies address the longer
   term situation, the implementation of two U.S. depredation orders and
   new research directions identified in the first Special Publication and
   in subsequent smaller cormorant symposia. Seventeen papers which
   comprise this volume are presented under six headings: introduction,
   impacts to natural resources, population dynamics, evaluation of control
   efforts, assessing fish consumption and bioenergetics, migration ecology
   and local and seasonal movements, and summary overview and future
   information needs. A second Special Publication on Double-crested
   Cormorants gives us an opportunity to assess how well cormorant
   biologists have addressed and answered questions we posed to ourselves
   15 years earlier; it also provides us with a vision for the next 18
   years. Received 10 October 2011, accepted 1 April 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Colonially nesting waterbirds transfer large quantities of aquatically
   derived nutrients into terrestrial systems, potentially altering
   community and ecosystem structure. Over the past three decades, the
   Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has undergone rapid
   population expansion throughout much of its historic range in North
   America, recolonizing habitats that had not supported colonial
   waterbirds for decades. Mounting evidence suggests that these
   populations are degrading the habitats they colonize primarily through
   the destruction of vegetation and the alteration of soil conditions. The
   study examined the effects of cormorants and co-occurring long-legged
   wading bird species including Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax
   nycticorax), Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula)
   on their nesting habitats by observing plant and arthropod community
   structure as well as soil and leaf litter characteristics at colonized
   and non-colonized sites on two islands in New York Harbor. Understory
   plant species richness and total plant cover were reduced, and the
   arthropod community shifted from primarily plant feeders to primarily
   carrion and dung feeders beneath cormorant nests in comparison to
   adjacent non-colonized habitats. On the island where cormorants have
   been established longer, the colony tended to be denser and larger and
   was associated with larger ecological impacts on plants, arthropods and
   soils. Long-legged wading bird colonies and more recently established
   cormorant colonies were smaller, less dense, and were generally
   associated with fewer ecological impacts. Received 21 September 2007,
   accepted 13 November 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Carolinian habitats on Middle Island in the western basin of Lake Erie
   have recently experienced a dramatic rise in nesting Double-crested
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Nesting cormorants on the 0.3 x 1.1
   km island increased from three pairs in 1987 to 4,690 pairs in 2006. The
   physical attributes of individual trees and poles were assessed using
   common indices of tree health to determine whether forest damage
   increased with cormorant nesting densities. Crown density, branch
   damage, foliage transparency and decay were measured at 54 sampling
   stations along twelve transects in June of 2004, 2005 and 2006. All
   damage indices except for tree crown density and pole decay class
   increased over time, with trees more damaged than poles. Nests were more
   than four times more likely to be found in superstory trees than
   overstory trees and were virtually absent from understory trees,
   suggesting that Double-crested Cormorants prefer larger trees as nesting
   sites. However, despite greater cormorant preference for large trees,
   understory and open canopy trees had significantly greater levels of
   foliage transparency compared to overstory trees. The spatial
   distribution of damage varied across the island. Stem damage was lower
   in the center of the island compared to the western and eastern
   sections. Branch damage and foliage transparency were also greater on
   the eastern edge of the island than in the center suggesting that
   impacts were not yet concentrated within the forest interior. Densities
   of Double-crested Cormorant nests per station were significantly related
   to all damage indices except decay class. Stations with high numbers of
   cormorant nests were more likely to have lower crown densities, More
   transparent foliage and greater branch damage than stations with fewer
   cormorant nests. The data suggested that the distributional variation in
   damage could be used to better target specific areas of the island for
   management such as deployment of sonic deterrent systems, egg oiling or
   culling. Received 26 February 2009, accepted 28 April 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations have
   rapidly increased in the Great Lakes and in wintering areas in the
   southeast USA since the mid-1970s, resulting in conflicts with humans.
   To increase understanding of their population biology, band-recovery
   models were used to estimate temporal trends in hatch year (HY), second
   year (SF), and after second year (ASY) survival of cormorants banded in
   the Great Lakes from 1979 to 2006. SY and ASY annual survival varied
   among years with no apparent trend. HY annual survival exhibited a
   negative log-linear trend. Lack of clear temporal patterns in SF and ASY
   survival suggested that increases in cormorant abundance subsequent to
   1979 did not impact survival in these age-classes, whereas HY annual
   survival declined as abundance increased. In addition, issuance of
   depredation orders in 1998 and 2003 appeared to have a small negative
   effect on HY survival, but no clear effect on SF and ASY annual
   survival. The percentage of band returns reported from cormorant control
   operations generally increased over time, and greatly during the
   depredation orders. Mean +/- SE annual survival from 1979 to 2006 was
   0.446 +/- 0.022 for HY, 0.835 +/- 0.026 for SF, and 0.884 +/- 0.020 for
   ASY individuals. Although increases in cormorant abundance did not
   appear to be related to increases in annual survival, the relatively
   high average annual survival rate of ASY cormorants may have been
   responsible for rapid population growth in the 1980s and 1990s in the
   Great Lakes. Received 31 October 2007, accepted 7 April 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Banding records were examined to identify changes in mortality causes
   and locations of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in
   Door County, Wisconsin. In 14 out of 18 years between 1988 and 2005, a
   total of 22,469 birds were banded (300 to 5,462; average 1,605 per
   active banding year). Of 649 usable band returns (36.1 +/- 5.4 per
   year), 33\% were banding-year recoveries (before 1 May of the first year
   of life). The yearly rate of banding-year recoveries increased from
   0.7\% per year before 1996 to 2.2\% per year after 1999. The yearly
   proportion of all band recoveries attributed to animal damage control
   operations also increased over time. The yearly proportion of band
   returns from Mississippi Delta states increased over time. Mortality
   rates, both natural and anthropogenic, of cormorants from these colonies
   appear to have risen as the population has grown and control activities
   in southern states have increased. Apparent survival rates were
   estimated by mark-recapture methods during 2001 to 2006. Birds
   color-banded as adults had a model-averaged annual survival rate of
   0.696. For birds banded as nestlings, the model-averaged survival rates
   were: 0.305 (first year), 0.774 (second and third year), and 0.633
   (adults). Simulations of these measured survival rates combined with
   previously estimated reproductive rates demonstrated that emigration and
   immigration rates complicate interpretation of these results. Also,
   simulations demonstrate the potential efficacy of reproductive controls
   in reducing local breeding populations. Submitted 21 September 2007,
   accepted 27 November 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Binational colonial waterbird censuses were formally initiated in the
   Great Lakes in 1976, and have been repeated every eight to ten years.
   Although population estimates from these efforts are good trend
   indicators for some species, including Double-crested Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax auritus), information is generally not available to
   examine population changes between census periods, especially at a local
   scale. The study examined short-term, annual population changes and
   distribution patterns of cormorants in the Beaver Archipelago of
   northern Lake Michigan between 2000 and 2007, and compared these data to
   decadal trends. Although no control efforts were underway between 2000
   and 2006, an egg-oiling and culling program was initiated in 2007, after
   the completion of the decadal census. The peak number of breeders was
   documented in 1997, with lower population sizes between 2000 and 2006;
   however, in 2007, the population again approached peak numbers,
   suggesting that immigration from other regions occurred. Overall, yearly
   surveys determined that individual colonies showed great plasticity in
   breeding population size, with some colonies forming and others
   disappearing; some changes were due to environmental factors, while
   others indicate interactions with other species, human disturbance, and
   perhaps management activities in other areas of the Great Lakes. Yearly
   population estimates indicate that the long-term trends are probably
   captured with decadal colonial waterbird surveys, but the dynamic nature
   of cormorant populations is not. In addition, presence of yearly
   variation in the breeding population size of an ``unmanaged{''}
   population emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring species that
   are managed aggressively. Received 17 September 2007, accepted 27
   November 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) have used central New
   York waters for breeding and stopover habitats during migration since
   1984. In response to public concern over Oneida Lake, the United States
   Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and the New York State
   Department of Environmental Conservation initiated an integrated
   research, management and monitoring program aimed at mitigating
   cormorant impacts to fisheries and other natural resources in 1998. The
   history of this program was reviewed and efforts to reduce negative
   impacts of the Double-crested Cormorant population in central New York
   described. Management was successful, as demonstrated by a substantial
   decrease in cormorant use of Oneida Lake during spring, summer and fall
   seasons, and the apparent recovery of certain sportfish populations.
   Research identified cormorant movement patterns within and among water
   bodies and documented cormorant responses to hazing and other management
   techniques. The cormorant management program in central New York was
   intended to keep cormorant use of Oneida Lake at a level that prevents
   unsustainable impacts to fisheries populations. Received 14 September

Abstract = {{The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation initiated a
   Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) control program in the
   eastern basin of Lake Ontario to mitigate cormorant impacts in 1999. Key
   objectives included improving the quality of Smallmouth Bass
   (Micropterus dolomieu) and other fisheries, restoring the structure and
   function of the warmwater fish community and reducing cormorant impacts
   to nesting habitats of other colonial waterbird species. In eight years
   of intensive control, cormorant numbers declined, with a corresponding
   reduction in estimated fish consumption. Diversity and numbers of
   co-occurring waterbirds either increased or have not been shown to be
   negatively impacted by management. Woody vegetation favorable to
   Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) has been maintained.
   A ca. 2.5-fold increase in the abundance of Smallmouth Bass abundance in
   assessment nets over the last seven years is a sign of improved
   recruitment to the fishery. Since the target population level of 4,500
   to 6,000 cormorants has essentially been achieved, the eastern Lake
   Ontario cormorant program is expected to shift in 2007 from a population
   reduction focus towards a less intensive program intended to prevent
   population resurgence. Received 5 September 2007, accepted 20 December

Abstract = {{Increasing populations of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) throughout North America have had a significant impact on fish
   resources in areas where they breed. A simple Excel model was used to
   assess the effectiveness of lethal control methods in reducing fish
   consumed by a breeding population of cormorants. Egg oiling was found to
   reduce seasonal fish consumption by an average of 504 +/- 75 (SD) metric
   tonnes (N = 3) while culling reduced consumption by 280 +/- 205 (SD)
   tons (N = 3). Cost-effectiveness of each method was also assessed using
   values from a control program in Lac La Biche, Alberta, Canada. Egg
   oiling cost an average of CDN\$5.26 +/- 0.84 (SD; N = 3) for each ton of
   fish saved from consumption by cormorants and culling cost \$36.14 +/-
   8.90 (SD; N = 3). While culling alone is capable of controlling
   consumption by adult and young-of-the-year cormorants, egg oiling
   provides a practical and cost-effective alternative for management of
   ground-nesting cormorants when used in combination or when culling is
   not available as a management option. Received 13 September 2007,
   accepted 2 February 2009.}},

Pages = {{77-81}},
Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) numbers in the Great
   Lakes of North America have increased dramatically during the past three
   decades. Current concerns include negative effects of cormorants on
   aquatic food webs, destruction of nesting habitat and competition with
   other avian species and odors due to feces. Control of cormorant nesting
   and roosting has been variably successful and sometimes involves lethal
   force and/or loud devices. These approaches may be unsuitable in some
   settings, such as parks or residential areas. A large group of
   cormorants (up to 2,000 individuals) has used Farr Island, a small
   island near houses on the North Shore of Hamilton Harbour at the west
   end of Lake Ontario, Canada, as a post-breeding roosting area. The
   concentration of birds has resulted in complaints regarding odors from
   the island. In an attempt to alleviate the strong odor and to examine
   options to limit cormorant nest site competition with other species, a
   tethered Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis) was placed on the roost island
   for twelve days from 9 to 21 September 2003. The eagle was effective at
   causing roosting cormorants to avoid the island, apparently causing many
   to move their roost site a short distance to another island nearby.
   Complete cormorant displacement lasted at least four days beyond the
   period of eagle presence on the island. Using a tethered large raptor
   appears to be an effective non-lethal tool for local displacement of
   roosting Double-crested Cormorants. Received 20 September 2007, accepted

Abstract = {{During the last 25 years, North America has experienced a significant
   increase in Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). The
   increase has caused concern among wildlife and fisheries managers
   dealing with the perceived and/or real impacts of this bird on
   fisheries. Cormorant foraging and breeding ecology were examined at a
   large (>6,000 pairs), unmanaged colony in Lake Ontario, Canada. Chick
   diet, feeding rates and productivity were evaluated during 2006 and
   2007. In 2007, the proportion of adult cormorants making long-range
   foraging trips (more than ten kilometers) during different stages of the
   breeding season was estimated. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) composed
   greater than 86\% of chick diet by mass during both years; suggesting
   that cormorants did not often prey on sport fish for feeding chicks.
   Chicks were fed approximately 4.5 times per day in 2006, which was
   significantly lower than 5.9 feeds per day during 2007. Productivity was
   high in both years, with 2.2 and 1.9 chicks produced per nest in 2006
   and 2007, respectively. The decrease in productivity corresponded with
   an increase in colony size, from 6,125 to 7,241 pairs. In 2007,
   approximately one-fifth of the nesting colony foraged at least ten
   kilometers throughout the breeding season. Cormorants fed their chicks
   very few sport fish in the Toronto area; however, more work is required
   to determine whether the consumption of Alewife by cormorants represents
   competition with sport fish for prey. Received 17 September 2007,

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) began to recolonize
   Leech Lake, Minnesota, in the 1990s and reached 2,524 breeding pairs
   before control measures started in 2005. Walleye (Sander vitreus)
   recruitment concurrently declined, creating concern in the local
   community. To better understand the impacts of cormorants on fish, a
   cormorant diet analysis was conducted and two models were compared:
   Madenjian and Gabrey (1995) and Niche Mapper (TM) for estimating
   cormorant consumption of fish. Stomach content analysis revealed Yellow
   Perch (Perca flavescens) to be the most dominant species, providing 80\%
   and 40\% of the overall diet in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The
   Madenjian and Gabrey and the Niche Mapper (TM) models showed similar
   results in estimating daily food consumption of cormorants despite their
   different approaches and complexity levels. In both models, consumption
   estimates were greater in 2005 than in 2006, with 26 to 33\% of their
   total body mass in 2005 and 18 to 22\% of their total body mass in 2006.
   Likely the variation was caused by the variation in diet found in
   cormorant stomachs and the difference in the caloric densities of their
   diet between the two years, with Lake Herring (or Cisco, Coregonus
   artedi) being more prevalent in the diet in 2006. The most sensitive
   parameters in the Madenjian and Gabrey model were daily energy
   expenditure, assimilation efficiency, caloric density of fish and weight
   of cormorants. In the Niche Mapper (TM) model, core body temperature of
   cormorants and caloric density of fish were the most sensitive
   parameters. The strengths and weaknesses of both models are discussed,
   while providing guidance for researchers to select the method most
   applicable to their specific site and available data. Received 1 October

Abstract = {{The Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus) is a small benthic fish, native
   to the Eurasian Ponto-Caspian region, that has rapidly spread through
   the entire Laurentian Great Lakes system since its 1990 discovery in
   Lake St. Clair. Tolerant of high population densities, the exotic Round
   Goby competes aggressively with native fish for food and habitat, and
   has increasingly been exploited by endemic Great Lakes predators. A
   management program for the Upper Niagara River, initiated in 2004, has
   provided an opportunity to study the interactions between these invaders
   and the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), a native top
   predator. The gut contents of 1,119 cormorants nesting at two sites in
   the Upper Niagara River from 2004 to 2007 were examined, and the species
   composition of ingested prey (by number and weight) was quantified for
   the 600 stomachs that contained identifiable prey. Results of these
   analyses indicate that Round Goby can constitute up to 85\% of the
   biomass in cormorant diet during periods of the breeding season, and
   that gobies are consumed by cormorants through all dates sampled (May
   through August). Lengths of Round Gobies recovered in the cormorant diet
   were skewed towards larger members of the goby population, suggesting
   non-random selection relative to the range of size possibilities, and
   displayed significant declines in length between and within seasons.

Abstract = {{A two-year satellite telemetry study was initiated in May 2000 at a
   Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) breeding colony on
   Little Galloo Island (LGI) in eastern Lake Ontario, New York, USA, which
   is managed by egg-oiling. The objective was to describe cormorant (N =
   26/year) movements, specifically during the period of reproductive
   management by egg-oiling and seasonally (breeding, migration and
   wintering). Egg-oiling at two-week intervals resulted in a hatch success
   on LGI of 5.7\% for 2000 and 2001, combined. The majority (97\%) of core
   use areas of marked cormorants contained LGI throughout three egg-oiling
   treatments (six weeks), and 71\% still contained LGI by the end of the
   final (fourth) treatment (eight weeks). Of cormorants that moved during
   or after control activities, three remained in the vicinity of active
   breeding colonies for over three months. Cormorants initiated fall
   migration over a 16-week period ranging from 12 July to 29 October, with
   a mean departure date of 6 September (N = 24, SE = 8 days) over both
   years. Mean duration of fall migration was 34 days (N = 19, SE = 7 days,
   range = 108 days). Most (75\%) cormorants captured at LGI migrated east
   of the Appalachian Mountains, and their winter range extended from
   southeastern Louisiana, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, to the
   southern portion of the Atlantic coast. Although three (13\%) cormorants
   over both years relocated to other active colonies for long enough
   periods (over three months) to potentially raise young, this study
   indicates that control efforts did not result in complete abandonment of
   LGI. Egg-oiling was successful in reducing recruitment within breeding
   seasons, and within-breeding-season renesting attempts by cormorants in
   this study were limited and likely unsuccessful. Further evaluation and
   refinement of egg-oiling as a management tool will require multiyear
   monitoring of the LGI cormorant breeding colony. Received 9 September
   2007, accepted 11 October 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) wintering
   in the southeastern United States have increased dramatically during the
   last 30 years concomitant with the rise of the aquaculture industry in
   this region. These cormorants commonly foraged at commercial aquaculture
   facilities and thereby came into conflict with farmers. Various interest
   groups are seeking ecologically sound strategies for minimizing the
   effects of burgeoning cormorant populations. Therefore, this study was
   conducted to estimate winter and summer home ranges of cormorants
   captured in the southeastern U.S. and determine whether age class, body
   mass, density of aquaculture facilities and availability of roost sites
   influenced size of these home ranges. Mean +/- SE home range size and
   core use area of satellite transmitter-marked cormorants wintering in
   the southeastern U.S. from 1999 to 2001 were 17,490 +/- 1,986 km(2) (N =
   37) and 1,550 +/- 265 km(2) (N = 37), respectively. Winter home range
   size was not affected by region, age class or body mass. Summer home
   range and core use area of marked cormorants was 30,547 +/- 6,197 km(2)
   (N = 6) and 3,124 +/- 1,019 km(2) (N = 6), respectively. Received 28

Abstract = {{Migration patterns of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus)
   wintering in the southeastern U.S. are poorly understood. Movement data
   were analyzed from 28 cormorants captured in Alabama, Arkansas,

   (three immature, one adult) cormorants did not migrate and stayed in the
   southeastern U.S. throughout the year. During spring, cormorants
   captured in Alabama migrated east of the Mississippi River and primarily
   west of the Appalachian Mountains. Cormorants from Arkansas, Louisiana
   and Mississippi migrated north along the Mississippi River Valley, the
   Missouri River Valley and/or the Ohio River Valley. The earliest
   departure for spring migration was 26 March, whereas the latest
   departure was 12 May. Adult cormorants departed for spring migration
   earlier than immature cormorants. The average departure date for fall
   migration was 1 October. Mean duration of spring migration was twelve
   days, and cormorants traveled an average of 70 km per day. Received 16

Abstract = {{An overview is provided of a symposium on the direction of research and
   management of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) heading
   into the 2000s. The current symposium built on previous efforts and
   described a number of focus areas of informational need, including
   cormorant impacts on natural resources, demographics of cormorants,
   assessment of control efforts, assessment of fish consumption and
   bioenergetics, and cormorant spatial ecology and influences on
   movements. The cormorant symposium highlighted a shift in research focus
   relative to earlier symposia, from evaluating potential impacts on
   commercial and natural resources to evaluating management actions in
   attaining desired goals. In addition, the symposium addressed the
   pressing need to obtain baseline information on cormorant population
   demographics. The shift reflects a response to increasing management
   efforts and intensity in North America and the need to understand the
   effects and effectiveness of increased cormorant control at several
   spatial scales. The symposium furthered communication and the sharing of
   information on cormorant issues in North America. However, uncertainty
   regarding impacts to cormorants associated with policy changes and
   management actions and outcomes presents significant future challenges.

Abstract = {{Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) nesting on edges of saline lakes
   within the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas are threatened by habitat
   degradation due to reduced artesian spring flow, making many saline
   lakes unsuitable for nesting and migrating shorebirds. Factors
   influencing nest success were evaluated, current nest success estimates
   in the SHP of Texas were compared to estimates obtained ten years prior,
   and causes and timing of nest failures determined. Overall, 215 nests
   were monitored from three saline lakes in 2008 -2009, with nest success
   estimates from Program MARK ranging from 7-33\% ((x) over bar = 22\%).
   The leading causes of nest failures were attributed to predation (40\%)
   and weather (36\%). Nest success was negatively influenced by number of
   plants within 707-cm(2) plot, positively influenced by percent surface
   water availability, and at one saline lake, negatively influenced by day
   during the nesting season (i.e., nest success declined later in the
   nesting season). When compared to estimates ten years prior (1998-1999),
   mean nest success has declined by 31\%. If nesting Snowy Plovers
   continue to experience increased predation rates, decreased hydrological
   integrity, and habitat alterations, populations will continue to decline
   throughout this region. Received 2 April 2011, accepted 10 August 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Clutch size and nest survival of Cackling Geese (Branta hutchinsii
   hutchinsii) nesting among light geese (Lesser Snow Geese (Chen
   caerulescens) and Ross's Geese (C. rossii;)) were examined at Karrak
   Lake, Nunavut, in Canada's central arctic, 1999-2009. Islands of Karrak
   Lake and adjacent Adventure Lake were selected by Cackling Geese for
   nesting instead of mainland habitat. Cackling Geese increasingly nested
   on islands during the study, while light goose nesting declined. Clutch
   size varied by year (range: 3.4-4.4 eggs), and declined with nest
   initiation date ((beta) over cap (NID) = -0.177 (95\% CI: -0.228,
   -0.126)). Nest survival during incubation varied among years (range: NW
   8.6-88.2\%), and was lowest during early and late incubation, although
   95\% CI of slope estimates with nest age included zero ((beta) over cap
   (Age) = 0.156 (95\% CI -0.072, 0.383), (beta) over cap (2)(Age) =
   -0.006, (95\% Cl -0.027, 0.014)). Nest survival declined with individual
   nest initiation date ((beta) over cap (NID) = -0.431 (95\% Cl: -0.680,
   -0.182)). There was little support. for nest survival models that
   included individual covariates of synchrony with light geese or weather
   during incubation. A posteriori analysis revealed that annual nest
   survival was greater in warmer years with less wind ((beta) over cap
   (YearWeather) = 1.738 (95\% Cl: 1.272, 2.205)), but spring phenology,
   intraspecific synchrony, or abundance of Cackling or light geese were
   not important. Reduced access to island-nesting geese by terrestrial
   predators, and predator satiation from high densities of nesting light
   geese on the surrounding mainland may result in islands within light
   goose colonies that are productive nesting habitats for many avian
   species, particularly if islands themselves are sparsely inhabited by
   light geese. Received 2 April 2011, accepted 26 August 2011.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few decades, Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) have become
   established in metropolitan areas throughout North America. From 1984
   through 2009, Canada Geese in New Haven County, Connecticut, were banded
   as goslings (HY geese) and adults (AHY), and their movements and
   recruitment into the local breeding population were documented. During
   this period, the number of Canada Geese increased several fold in
   Connecticut. Geese were non-migratory; most recoveries (85\%) of banded
   Canada Geese came from Connecticut, and 76\% came from New Haven County.
   Dispersal rates outside of Connecticut peaked during 1990-1994 when 23\%
   of all reported geese were shot outside of the state; more recently
   (2005-2009) only 3\% of reported geese were shot outside of Connecticut.
   The proportion of dispersing geese that moved northward in the Atlantic
   Flyway has increased in recent years. Similar proportions of AHY females
   (23\%) and AHY males (22\%) were recruited into the local breeding
   population. Among HY geese, more females (22\%) than males (5\%) were
   recruited because HY males were more likely to disperse out of the
   county than HY females. Non-migratory populations of geese in
   metropolitan areas are causing nuisance problems; the restricted
   movements of these geese indicate that efforts to reduce their
   populations will have to be conducted at the local level. Received 17
   May 2011, accepted 10 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding daily movements of waterfowl is crucial to management of
   winter habitats, especially along the Gulf Coast where hunting pressure
   is high. Radio-telemetry was used to investigate movements of female
   Mallards (Anus platyrchychos) wintering in southwestern Louisiana.
   Movement distances were analyzed from 2,455 paired locations (diurnal
   and nocturnal) of 126 Mallards during winters 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 to
   assess effects of winter, female age, areas closed (Lacassine National
   Wildlife Refuge RAC), Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge {[}CAM],
   Amoco Pool {[}AMOCO] or open to hunting {[}OPEN]), and habitat type,
   including all interactions. Movement distances from the various land
   management categories were not consistent by age, date, or by winter.
   Flight distances from LAC increased with date, whereas those from CAM
   and OPEN did not vary significantly by date. Female Mallards moved short
   distances between diurnal and nocturnal sites (ranging from 3.1 to 15.0
   km by land management category), suggesting that they are able to meet
   their daily energy requirements within a smaller area than Northern
   Pintails (Anas acuta, hereafter Pintails), and thus minimize transit
   energy costs. Received 16 April 2011, accepted 1 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by wintering Mallards (Anas platyrhychos) on the Gulf Coast
   Chenier Plain (GCCP) has received little study and quantitative data is
   needed for management of GCCP waterfowl. Radio-telemetry techniques were
   used to record habitats used by 135 female Mallards during winters
   2004-2005 and 2005-2006 in southwestern Louisiana. Habitat use was
   quantitatively estimated for areas open and closed to hunting, by
   general habitat types (i.e., marsh, rice, idle, pasture, or other), and
   for specific marsh types (i.e., freshwater, intermediate, brackish, or
   salt). Variation in these estimates was subsequently examined in
   relation to individual female, female age (adult or immature), winter
   (2004-2005 or 2005-2006), and hunt periods within winter (second hunting
   season {[}SHUNT] or post hunting season {[}POST]). Diurnal use of areas
   closed to hunting was greater during hunted time periods in winter
   2005-2006 than in winter 2004-2005. Nocturnal use of areas closed to
   hunting was 3.1 times greater during SHUNT than during POST, and
   immatures used areas closed to hunting more than adults. Diurnal use of
   marsh was 3.3 times greater than that of any other habitat during both
   winters. Nocturnal use of marsh, rice, idle, and pasture were similar
   during both winters. Females used freshwater marsh habitats extensively
   (64.6-99.8\% proportional use), whereas brackish and salt marsh combined
   was used less frequently (0-35.8\% proportional use). These results
   suggest that freshwater marsh is important to Mallards and a high
   priority for restoration and management efforts. Received 16 April 2011,

Abstract = {{Wading bird foraging success and habitat preference can be greatly
   affected by prey availability, which encompasses both prey density and
   the vulnerability of prey to capture. Two components of prey
   vulnerability, water depth and emergent vegetation, were manipulated
   within 10 in x 10 m enclosures to determine the relative effects on
   foraging habitat preference for eight species of wading birds and
   foraging success for a subset of four species that strike their prey.
   All species showed a strong preference for shallow water, and within
   this water depth showed a preference for the sparse vegetation density
   treatment. The preference For foraging habitat with a sparse or
   intermediate vegetation density has been documented in other studies,
   and may represent a tradeoff between selecting more heavily vegetated
   areas, which have a higher prey density, and more open areas, where prey
   are more vulnerable to capture. Almost all foraging occurred in the
   shallow water treatment, suggesting that preferred water depths
   constituted high quality habitat for wading birds. The weaker selection
   for sparse vegetation density and lack of an effect of vegetation
   density on capture rate and capture efficiency (p>0.05 for all tests,
   except Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) capture efficiency) suggested that
   emergent vegetation is of secondary importance to water depth as
   determinants of wading bird habitat quality. Received 15 December 2010,

Abstract = {{The value of foraging studies in developing conservation strategies for
   storks is important because their breeding is often limited by food
   distribution. The foraging behavior and trophic specializations of the
   Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), a flagship of wetlands and listed
   as near threatened, is reviewed here. Trophic adaptations among Mycteria
   and other storks, the importance of prey capture by tactolocation and
   various aspects of foraging behavior including diet, prey size, foraging
   and nesting correlates, variations in foraging activity, nocturnal
   foraging and kleptoparasitism are examined. Also, an account of the
   foraging behavior of a close congener, Milky Stork (NI. cinema), and the
   manner in which the foraging activities of Painted Stork, particularly
   biomass removal by predation and enrichment of the waters by droppings
   impact the ecosystem, is included. Since nesting of Painted Stork and
   other species of colonial waterbirds is closely linked to the
   performance of the monsoon, the primary driver triggering their food
   cycles, points for further studies are listed. Received 29 April 2011,
   accepted 19 July 2011.}},

   during Spring Migration}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{457-467}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As little is known about specific factors influencing wetland birds
   during migration, the effects of time period, hunting pressure, and year
   on wetland bird behavior were evaluated during spring migration. Avian
   behavior was quantified on 36-40 playa wetlands in the Rainwater Basin
   region of Nebraska, during springs 2002-2004. Multivariate analysis of
   variance was used to test for differences in behavior among time
   periods, hunting categories (closed to hunting, hunted wetlands
   in-season, and hunted wetlands post-season), and years for geese,
   dabbling ducks, diving ducks, and shorebirds, as well as among two
   species of management concern; Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser
   albifrons) and Northern Pintails (Anas acuta). Overall, goose behavior
   did not differ among time periods or years; however, a greater
   percentage of geese were observed feeding in wetlands closed to hunting
   (11\%) than on hunted wetlands in-season (5\%). A smaller percentage of
   dabbling ducks was observed feeding on hunted wetlands in-season (19\%)
   than on wetlands closed to hunting (24\%) or on hunted wetlands
   post-season (28\%). Diving duck and shorebird behavior did not differ
   among time periods, years, or hunting categories. Although spring
   hunting was implemented to reduce the light goose population, it may
   also be negatively influencing habitat quality at migration stopover
   sites for geese and dabbling ducks. Managers should consider limiting
   spring hunting disturbance on temporary and seasonal wetlands, where
   dabbling ducks spend more time foraging, than on semi-permanent
   wetlands. Received 20 April 2011, accepted 18 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) spend a substantial portion of their
   annual cycle at migratory staging areas. Despite the potential
   importance of staging areas to conservation of Eastern Population (EP)
   Tundra Swans, few data are available to assess life-history strategies
   of the species during migration. During 1999 and 2000, 48 adult Tundra
   Swans were collected during peak periods of spring and autumn migration
   at Long Point, Ontario, Canada, to establish baselines on nutrient
   reserve levels and morphology of digestive organs. Results were compared
   to nutrient reserve data for EP Tundra Swans collected at a major
   wintering area in North Carolina, USA. Lipid reserve levels did not
   differ between sexes nor varied with body size, but lipid reserves were
   approximately two times greater in autumn than spring. Males had greater
   protein reserves than females, and protein reserves were similar during
   autumn and spring. Although digestive organs were predicted to be longer
   and heavier during autumn, no seasonal variation in digestive organs was
   detected. Lipid reserve levels of Tundra Swans at Long Point during
   spring were similar to those recorded for wintering birds in North
   Carolina, suggesting that lipid reserves catabolized from autumn through
   winter were not replenished prior to arriving at this initial spring
   staging area. The results highlight the importance of managing quality
   aquatic and terrestrial foraging habitats at staging areas for
   conservation EP Tundra Swans. Received 24 June 2011, accepted 14

Abstract = {{Through the use of conspecific models and vocalizations, populations of
   conservation concern can be established in locations where limiting
   factors may be controlled or mitigated, assuming managers can both
   identify and create high-quality locations. From 2003 to 2008,
   conspecific attraction was used to establish populations of the
   state-endangered Forster's Tern (Sterna forsteri) in northeastern
   Illinois, USA. In 2009 and 2010, similar techniques were used with the
   federally-threatened Least Tern, (Sternula antillarum) near the
   confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers in Missouri, USA. At
   both locations, managers attempted to control factors that may limit
   tern reproductive success. While in most cases nesting populations were
   established, in some cases resulting in the greatest documented
   reproductive success in the region for decades, nest predation the year
   after the colonies were established was significantly higher than in the
   year the colony was established. The establishment of colonies attracted
   a variety of predators, some of which gained access to the colonies and
   predated tern nests. Conspecific attraction behavior may be a strategy
   used by birds to stay ``one step ahead{''} of nest predators, and the
   repeated use of conspecific attraction by managers may result in
   individuals nesting at a site with high rates of nest predation. As a
   conservation tool, conspecific attraction should only be used in
   situations where nest predators can be effectively controlled. Received
   4 May 2011, accepted 22 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Ducks are unusual because males of most Holarctic species acquire
   brightly-pigmented breeding plumages in autumn and winter and not spring
   as with most other birds. Based on an evaluation of molt Oenology of
   ducks under the system of molt terminology by invented Humphrey and
   Parkes (1959), Pyle (2005) concluded that, for most North American duck
   species, the molt that produces bright plumages is basic in nature, the
   molt that typically produces a short-lived, dull ``eclipse{''} plumage
   in spring or summer is alternate in nature, and the annual wing molt
   that largely occurs between these two molts is part of the subsequent
   recharacterized prebasic molt. For various reasons, it appears more
   likely that the timing of conventional prealternate molts in most
   Holarctic duck species has accelerated forward over time to autumn and
   winter in response to selection for early courtship and pairing, with
   resulting changes in the duration of alternate and basic plumages. These
   reasons include acceleration in the timing of the prealternate molt in
   sea ducks after they reach the age of first breeding. An accelerated
   timing of prealternate molts can explain why certain clucks exhibit an
   ephemeral, limited first prebasic molt, which appears to be a lost molt
   and not a virtually nonexistent, unique preformative molt as maintained
   by Pyle (2005). The accelerated timing hypothesis also can explain why
   the extent of prealternate molts may have become more complete and the
   extent of prebasic molts may have become less complete in certain
   clucks. The accelerated timing hypothesis appears more parsimonious from
   an evolutionary perspective than the system of Pyle (2005), and does not
   require the categorical rejection of plumage color and pattern in molt
   homology analyses, as advocated by Pyle (2005). Received 13 May 2011,
   accepted 28 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The food provided to South Polar Skuas (Stercorarius maccormicki) chicks
   was determined at two Antarctic sites where South Polar Skuas breed
   sympatrically with Brown Skuas (S. antarcticus). At Harmony Point on
   Nelson Island, 16 samples of regurgitated stomach contents were
   analyzed, all contained remains of penguin chicks (mostly soft tissues),
   which constituted the bulk of the contents, while only two samples had
   fish or krill remains. These South Polar Skuas had access to penguin
   colonies, where they hunted chicks or fed on fresh carcasses. However,
   at Half Moon Island, only two out of nine samples contained minor
   amounts of penguin remains while fish were the major dietary resource.
   The high fish content in their diet may indicate a preference for marine
   rather than terrestrial resources or be the result of competition with
   Brown Skuas. The variability in food items evidenced by the differences
   in regurgitated stomach contents indicates that South Polar Skuas may
   have a trophic plasticity that allows them to change their feeding
   habits from one resource to another one according to availability. Such
   may make them less vulnerable to a reduction in the availability of a
   particular food item. Received 11 March 2011, accepted 27 August 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Population growth of piscivorous species raises concerns when it could
   affect aquaculture activities. In this study, an increase of the
   Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) population in the
   Ecuadorian Andes was documented using census data from three high Andean
   lakes (Yahuarcocha, San Pablo and Yambo) for 2004-2010. In the 20th
   Century, only one record of the species existed for the study area. From
   2005 onward, the species occurred regularly at all three lakes. At
   Yahuarcocha, the wintering population (October-February) grew at an
   annual rate of 0.382 +/- 0.05, reaching 307 in 2010. The population
   consists mainly of non-breeding migrants, and at the present time, the
   wintering distribution range of cormorant populations in Ecuador
   includes the high Andes. Given reports of cormorant predation at fish
   farms, potential conflicts on account of cormorant expansion are
   discussed. Received 21 December 2010, accepted 18 July 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The health of wildlife can be affected by the ingestion of non-edible,
   anthropogenic debris that mimic prey. First evidence of localized,
   massive ingestion of rubber bands is provided for an earthworm consumer,
   the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia), using nest contents and necropsies
   recorded in France. In 2003-2004, the prevalence of rubber bands and
   other debris in nests (N = 227) differed between the nine regions
   analyzed and decreased as distance from the nearest rubbish dump
   (distRD) increased. Hence, ingestion of rubber bands would occur only at
   some rubbish dumps. Nests with rubber bands contained 6.5 +/- 2.5 units
   (max: 27; independent of dist RD). The number of chicks was not related
   to the presence/absence of rubber bands in their nest. In 2008-2010,
   26\% of necropsied storks (N = 57: Alsace region) had rubber bands in
   their digestive tract. Seven instances of death due to gut occlusion by
   rubber bands are reported. Immature birds may be more exposed to rubber
   band ingestion than adults because of their lower ability at
   discriminating and regurgitating non-edible items, as well as their
   higher frequentation of rubbish dumps. The disposal of used rubber bands
   in a form that prevents ingestion by earthworm consumers is recommended.

Abstract = {{Sound management of the Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) requires an
   understanding of its survival and cause-specific mortality, yet these
   parameters have not been studied in Taiwan. From January 1999 to
   December 2002, a study was conducted along the Tachia River, in central
   Taiwan, where the largest population of Mandarin ducks resides. The sex
   ratio was male-biased for adults (average 2.10:1) but not for juveniles
   (average 0.92:1). Ducks (34 males and 42 females) were radio-tagged and
   monitored two to three times per month for 1-47 months. Annual
   survivorship was 0.80 and 0.44 for male and female ducks, respectively;
   lower female survival may lead to a male-biased sex ratio. Forty-three
   ducks died, the greatest proportion from unknown causes, followed by
   avian predators, mammalian predators and anthropogenic activity.
   Mortality occurred year-round, but female mortality was greatest from
   spring to fall, 9-10 carcasses, while male mortality (seven) was
   greatest in the winter. Received 20 May 2011, accepted 26 September

Abstract = {{Sites where Barrow's Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica) undergo remigial
   molt and fall staging are poorly known, with only two major sites
   documented in Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Satellite telemetry,
   aerial surveys and ground surveys were used to identify previously
   unknown molting and fall staging areas in the Boreal Transition Zone
   (BTZ) of northern Alberta. Of 816 wetlands surveyed between 2004 and
   2006 in the BTZ, 40-45\% (105-127 lakes annually) had molting
   goldeneyes. Of these, 1.3-3.3\% were used by large aggregations of
   goldeneyes (>100 birds). Two wetlands, Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, were
   particularly important, with an estimated 5,000-7,000 Barrow's
   Goldeneyes, primarily adult males, using these sites during remigial
   molt and fall staging. Birds used these sites up to five months or over
   one-third of their annual cycle. Half of adult males marked with
   satellite transmitters at a breeding area in interior British Columbia
   used Cardinal Lake for postbreeding activities. Discovery of these sites
   represents some of the largest concentrations of molting Barrow's
   Goldeneyes in North America, and the only major molting sites currently
   known for the intermountain breeding portion of the western population.
   Protection of Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, and other significant molting
   and staging sites within the BTZ, should be a priority conservation
   effort for this species. Received 29 March 2011, accepted 30 May 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Decline of the Dusky Canada Goose (Branta canadensis occidentalis;
   hereafter, Dusky Goose) population on the western Copper River Delta
   (CRD) prompted the establishment of an artificial nest island (island)
   program in 1983. A retrospective analysis of the program was conducted
   to examine general trends in island use and nest success from 1984-2005.
   A series of candidate models was generated to determine how habitat,
   island and biological variables were associated with island use and nest
   success from 1996-2005. Use of islands by Dusky Geese increased between
   1987 and 2005 from 10\% to 44\%; apparent nest success averaged 64 +/-
   4\% and showed no trend with year. Island use was consistently and
   strongly associated with the previous year's island status. The odds of
   nesting on an island that contained a successful nest the previous year
   were four times greater than for islands not used the previous year.
   Likelihood of island use was highest at moderate shrub cover and
   increased with shrub height. Likelihood of nest success increased on
   islands further from shore. The influence of year suggests the presence
   of alternate prey and predator abundance is more important to nest
   success than island features. The increasing use of islands while the
   CRD Dusky Goose population has been declining indicates that islands may
   be increasingly important to population productivity. However,
   quantifying the contribution of the island program requires a better
   understanding of other population metrics, such as gosling mortality,.

   that were near shore (<850 m) and over a sand-rock substrate with stands
   of rockweed (Fucus spp.) and kelp (Laminaria spp.). Foraging flocks used
   intertidal and shallow subtidal areas (<4 m depth), whereas nonforaging
   flocks often used deeper subtidal waters farther offshore. Eighty
   percent of esophagi from 30 collected Red-breasted Mergansers contained
   >= 1 fish. Grubby (Myoxocephalus aenaeus) and sandlance (Ammodytes spp.)
   were in 43-53\% of esophagi, and their relative abundance in an
   esophagus averaged 29-36\%. Birds spent an average 23\% of the diurnal
   period foraging, but foraged nearly 70\% of the time when the tide was
   low in the morning and evening. The proportion of time that males
   devoted to foraging during the first half of the flightless season
   (18\%; 19 July-12 August) was nearly half that in the second half of the
   season (30\%; 13 August-5 September). The shallow waters along the
   shores of Anticosti Island are of particular importance to Red-breasted
   Merganser populations in eastern North America because 1) >3000 males
   undergo wing molt at the island and 2) these habitats are generally free
   of human disturbance during the flightless period. Received 10 June
   2010, accepted 19 June 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Total annual seabird bycatch in the U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline
   fishery was estimated from observer data by means of alternative methods
   to address the low frequency and uneven distribution of bird bycatch
   observations. Models used for estimation included generalized additive
   models (GAM), generalized linear models (GLM) and GLM with spatial or
   spatio-temporally autocorrelated bycatch observations (s-GLM). Models
   were fitted separately to the probability of non-zero seabird capture
   (presence/absence) and to the numbers of seabirds per non-zero capture
   (positive bycatch); final estimates were obtained as the product of the
   two. Best-fitting models included latitude, longitude and quarter of
   year as covariates for presence/absence, and numbers of hooks per set
   for positive bycatch. Among the models compared, GLM gave the most
   consistent predictions of annual total seabird captures. For 2008, the
   most recent year modeled, GLM predicted 81 seabirds caught in 8,862
   sets. The number is small on an Atlantic-wide or world-wide scale but is
   concentrated in an area of high species diversity that includes
   relatively small populations. GLM was recommended to be used in future
   Atlantic pelagic longline seabird bycatch estimation. Received 13

Abstract = {{To find morphological characteristics that might identify the sex of
   Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica), body morphometrics (wing chord,
   culmen length, bill depth, number of bill grooves, and head-bill length)
   and presence or absence of a brood patch were compared in a sample of
   195 adult Atlantic Puffins of known genetic sex caught on Machias Seal
   Island, in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Discriminant Function Analysis
   (DFA) was performed on 98 birds, and then tested on a separate,
   independent dataset of 97 birds. The measurements that best predicted
   sex were culmen length, bill depth, and head-bill length, which
   correctly classified 81\% of our sample. The second-best function
   included only bill depth and head-bill length, which classified 77\% of
   our sample correctly. Testing the three-predictor discriminant function
   on a second dataset resulted in a 73\% correct classification for the
   first discriminant equation, and 79\% for the second. Classification
   success was improved to 81\% by removing younger birds (with <1.5
   grooves), and to similar to 90\% by further excluding non-breeding birds
   (those without a brood-patch). Received 12 April 2011, accepted 6 May

Abstract = {{Individualized markers that allow organisms to be identified without
   recapture are invaluable for studies of survival, movement, and
   behavior. Nape tags consisting of brass safety pins with unique
   combinations of two or three colored plastic beads were used to mark
   5,868 American Coot (Fulica americana) chicks and 331 Ruddy Duck (Oxyura
   jamaicensis), 157 King Eider (Somateria spectabilis) and 664
   White-winged Scoter (Melanitta fusca deglandi) ducklings. These markers
   allowed for documentation of parent-offspring interactions,
   post-hatching survival, brood movements and brood-mixing behaviors. Nape
   tags were inexpensive, easy to make, easy to observe with binoculars or
   spotting scopes and provided over 100 two-bead or 1,000 three-bead color
   combinations for individual identification. For coots, there was no
   evidence of color biases affecting parental care or offspring survival,
   although some colors (white, yellow) were easier to detect than others
   (brown). The only observed problem was marker loss, with tag loss rates
   reaching 20\% near fledging age. Nape tags worked effectively on coots
   and ducklings and may be useful for other precocial waterbirds. Received

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the population status of many marsh-dependent
   birds in North America but recent efforts have focused on collecting
   more reliable information and estimates of population trends. As part of
   that effort, a standardized survey protocol was developed in 1999 that
   provided guidance for conducting marsh bird surveys throughout North
   America such that data would be consistent among locations. The original
   survey protocol has been revised to provide greater clarification on
   many issues as the number of individuals using the protocol has grown.
   The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol instructs
   surveyors to conduct an initial 5-minute passive point-count survey
   followed by a series of 1-minute segments during which marsh bird calls
   are broadcast into the marsh following a standardized approach.
   Surveyors are instructed to record each individual bird from the suite
   of 26 focal species that are present in their local area on separate
   lines of a datasheet and estimate the distance to each bird. Also,
   surveyors are required to record whether each individual bird was
   detected within each 1-minute subsegment of the survey. These data allow
   analysts to use several different approaches for estimating detection
   probability. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring
   Protocol provides detailed instructions that explain the field methods
   used to monitor marsh birds in North America. Received 26 January 2011,
   accepted 2 April 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) were monitored during spring migration
   across a network of ten aerial transects within the barrier
   island-lagoon system along the lower Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, USA.
   Transects were surveyed weekly from the last week of April through the
   first week of June (1994-1996, 2008-2009). Whimbrel numbers increased to
   a peak during the first and second weeks of May then decreased sharply
   during the third and fourth weeks of May in all years. Between the
   1990's and 2000's, peak numbers declined by 50\%, corresponding to a
   4.2\% annual rate of decline. A similar decline was detected in
   accumulated, season-wide numbers. Though similar in pattern, migration
   phenology was significantly different between the decades. The phenology
   difference resulted from a greater reduction in numbers during the first
   half of the study period compared to the last. Habitats used by
   Whimbrels (N = 31,314) included mudflats (95\%) and salt marshes (5\%).
   Habitat-specific densities (birds/km(2)) were 443 +/- 26.6 and 9 +/- 1.6
   (mean +/- SE) for mudflat and marsh patches, respectively, during the
   1990's and 222 +/- 11.1 and 8 +/- 4.6 during the 2000's. These results
   support suggestions that Whimbrels are declining on the Hudson Bay
   breeding grounds and perhaps at major Atlantic Coast wintering sites.

Abstract = {{Long-jump migrant shorebirds have brief windows during spring stopover
   to acquire the energy needed to complete migration. Red Knots (Calidris
   canutus) refueling on Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs in
   Delaware Bay can meet their energy needs foraging only by day. In nearby
   Virginia, thousands of Red Knots stop over, but primarily low-quality,
   hard-shelled prey are available. One tactic Red Knots may use to meet
   their energy demands with such prey might be to extend their foraging
   time by feeding at night. To estimate the length of the foraging day in
   Virginia, daylight feeding was studied during three spring stopover
   periods (2008 to 2010), and night feeding was studied in 2010. Red Knots
   foraged 76 +/- 3 SE\% of the time in 2008 and 2009 combined, and 59 +/-
   3\% of the time in 2010, during 3-minute observations. In 2010, Red
   Knots foraged 51 +/- 7\% of the time during a continuous 7-h daytime
   observation and 77 +/- 5\% of the time during a continuous 8-h night
   time observation on the same island. Given constraints on energy intake,
   night foraging by Red Knots in Virginia may be necessary for birds to
   attain sufficient mass to complete migration. Received 10 December 2010,
   accepted 25 April 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the diet of top marine predators, such as seabirds, is
   important in understanding their place in the trophic network and
   effects of global climate change, but knowledge of the diet of several
   procellariiformes remains anecdotal. The diet of Bulwer's Petrel
   (Bulweria bulwerii) in the Azores was studied over two consecutive years
   using stomach Bushings from 85 birds. The frequency of occurrence of
   prey taxa (\%O) was similar in both years (chi(2) = 5.396, d.f. = 5, p =
   0.370), with squid being the most common. Fish and squid were of similar
   occurrence by number (\%N) in the diet (49\% and 51\%, respectively) in
   1998 but in 1999 fish were more numerous (62\% against 38\% for squid).
   Squid lower beaks from five families and fish otoliths from six families
   were identified, representing 20 taxa. The most abundant prey in both
   years were squid Pyroteuthis margnritifera and the mesopelagic fish
   Electrona risso. The maximum standard length of fish and squid consumed
   was 7 cm and 11 cm, respectively. Given most of the identified prey are
   luminescent, the findings corroborate earlier studies suggesting
   Bulwer's Petrel feed on small mesopelagic prey that migrate to the
   surface at night. Received 16 December 2010, accepted 10 May 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow-breasted Crake (Porzana flaviventer) is a poorly-known
   Neotropical rail found in densely vegetated freshwater wetlands; a
   single nest record exists for Puerto Rico. In May 2001, the crake was
   detected in managed impoundments of the Humacao Nature Reserve, located
   in southeastern Puerto Rico. Yellow-breasted Crakes were regularly
   observed during monthly surveys of the impoundments with as many as nine
   individuals detected during an April 2002 survey. Systematic nest
   searches during 2001-2002 located fifteen nests in approximately 13 ha
   of newly created wetlands. The nests were more common in Eleocharis
   mutata, Cyperus ligularis, and Paspalum vaginatum. Nests had an average
   clutch size of 3.7 (+/-0.31) eggs and brood size of 2.7 (+/-0.5) chicks;
   hatching success was 65\% and nesting success 40\%. Six nests were
   depredated. The nesting activity of Yellow-breasted Crake at the Humacao
   Nature Reserve suggests wetland management in abandoned sugarcane areas
   of coastal Puerto Rico may benefit waterbird species of concern. Future
   research should determine abundance estimates and habitat relationships
   for this secretive species. Received 21 January 2011, accepted 19 May

Abstract = {{The coast of the state of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil, was surveyed for
   migratory shorebirds during northern summer and the southward migration
   period, late May through October 2010. Shorebirds were counted along
   beaches and rivers mouths. A total of eleven species was recorded. The
   most common were Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus),
   Semipalmated Sandpiper (Candris pusilla), Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus)
   and Black-belled Plover (Pluvialis squatarola). The highest richness,
   diversity, abundance and frequency of birds occurred on the two largest
   estuaries, Paraiba do Norte and Mamanguape, during southward migration
   period. Received 11 March 2011, accepted 28 May 2011.}},

Abstract = {{As the importance of the Black Sea for wintering waterbirds is poorly
   known, the species composition and abundance of waterbirds wintering on
   the Crimean Peninsula coast (Northern Black Sea) was investigated in two
   habitat types: urban areas and open sea coast. Of 27 waterbird species,
   25 were recorded in urban areas, and the dominants were Coot (Fulica
   atra), Black-headed Gull (Lams ridihundus) and Common Gull (Lams canus).
   On the open sea coast, fifteen species were recorded, the dominants
   being Coot, cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo and Phalacmcorax
   aristotelis) and Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus). The species
   structure of the wintering waterbird community differed significantly
   between habitats. A trait of the open sea coast community was the high
   diversity and domination of diving ichthyophagous species. Waterfowl
   were recorded only in urban areas, which increased species diversity in
   this habitat. The number of birds wintering on the open sea coast was
   significantly lower than in the urban areas. Males dominated among
   clucks, and adult birds dominated among Black-headed and Common Gulls
   wintering in urban areas. The age structure of Caspian Gulls (Lams
   cachinnans) differed significantly between the two habitats, with adults
   dominant on the open sea coast, and immature birds making up more than
   half of all recorded Caspian Gulls in urban areas. The importance of the
   Black Sea for wintering waterbirds has been underestimated. Marine and
   coastland ecosystems with concentrations of waterbirds should be
   designated and protected as Important Bird Areas (IBAs). Received 1

Abstract = {{Bird surveys were carried out from 1973 to 2010 in Mar Chiquita, an
   extensive saline lake and associated Du Ice River marshes in central
   Argentina. The wetland has had marked fluctuations in water level and
   salinity over the past four decades. At the beginning of the 1970s, Mar
   Chiquita experienced a large drop in level and there were no waterbirds
   on the Segundo River mouth. By 1974 the lake had recovered its level and
   the Segundo River estuary had formed, harboring large concentrations of
   local waterbirds and Nearctic shorebirds. From mid-1977, a rise in water
   level led to the disappearance of the Segundo River estuary and by 2003
   the lake area had expanded by about 3.5 times and covered half of the Du
   Ice River marshes. Consequently, the wetland, especially the river
   estuaries, became less important for local waterbirds and Nearctic
   shorebirds. Since 2003 Mar Chiquita has fallen 4 in, beaches have formed
   and salinity has increased, but currently there are no Nearctic
   shorebird concentrations. For the site to recover its importance for
   birds, Mar Chiquita should continue dropping and salinity continue
   increasing. Received 11 January 2011, accepted 6 June 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling habitat selection of species with specific foraging
   requirements is an effective means to evaluate landscape quality for
   restoration and conservation purposes. Proportional hazards regression,
   a discrete choice model, was used to develop resource selection
   functions for breeding Wood Stork in the southern Everglades during the
   2006 nesting season. Wood Storks showed the highest probability of
   habitat selection in a narrow range of shallow water depths. The
   quadratic form of water depth (depth+depth(2)) was an important
   indicator of habitat selection with mean water depths between -25 and 25
   cm receiving the highest probability of use (a negative water depth is
   below average ground elevation). Foraging sites within 20 km of nesting
   colonies were selected over farther sites. Shrub swamp, mangrove swamp
   and saltwater marsh vegetation types were used in higher proportions
   than they occurred in the landscape. Results exemplify the importance of
   shallow water depths near established stork breeding colonies throughout
   the breeding season. Received 14 July 2010, accepted 1 December 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland-scale and landscape-scale descriptors were compiled at 123
   wetlands where Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) have been detected in
   Quebec since 1986 to identify key attributes associated with Least
   Bittern occurrence. Land cover information extracted from Landsat-7 ETM
   imagery and road density were calculated for a 500-m buffer surrounding
   occupied wetlands and paired sites ten km away to compare to the
   regional landscape. Cattail (Typha spp.) was the dominant vegetation at
   96 of 123 wetlands. Shrub swamps were used at eleven sites. Wetland area
   ranged from 0.5 ha to 983 ha and man-made impoundments accounted for
   24\% of occupied sites. The 500-m buffer surrounding occupied wetlands
   was dominated by urban areas, agriculture, forests or wetlands at four,
   22, 21 and 32 sites, respectively. Mean wetland cover was higher in the
   500-m buffer (37\%) than in the regional landscape (4\%) whereas
   agriculture cover was greater at paired sites (55\%) than around
   occupied wetlands (28\%). Cover of anthropogenic and forest areas did
   not differ between wetland buffers and paired sites. Mean road density
   was higher in the 500-m buffer around occupied wetlands (29.5 m/ha) than
   in the regional landscape (18.4 m/ha) suggesting that wetlands near
   roads may be more easily accessible to surveyors. Habitat use in Quebec
   corresponds with known breeding habitat structure elsewhere in North
   America. Along with wetland creation and conservation initiatives of
   remaining small and large wetlands, Least Bittern conservation Will
   benefit from regular monitoring of impoundments' operable conditions to
   prevent sudden habitat changes that may impact breeding birds. Received

Abstract = {{The Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) is one of a suite of sub-arctic-and
   arctic-nesting shorebirds for which encroachment of woody vegetation
   into previously open habitats may cause a reduction in breeding habitat.
   Whimbrel nesting habitat selection was studied at two spatial scales
   near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, to determine habitat preferences and
   the degree to which the species avoided woody vegetation. Whimbrels
   occupied sites at the mesohabitat (territory) scale characterized by
   either high lichen cover, or high graminoid and standing water cover. No
   Whimbrels nested in mesohabitat with >17.5\% tall shrub cover, and only
   one pair nested where >38 trees existed within 30 m of the nest. At the
   microhabitat (nest) scale, Whimbrels nested in two distinct habitats. In
   lichen-dominated sites, nests had less concealing vegetation than unused
   sites whereas in graminoid dominated habitats, nests were more concealed
   than unused sites. Sixty-eight percent of nests were on hummocks or
   lichen ridges. Hatching success was not predicted by habitat
   characteristics and was lower than previously reported (2007: 26\%;
   2008: 14\%). Avoidance of woody vegetation by breeding Whimbrels
   suggests that shrub and tree encroachment would reduce habitat
   availability in the Churchill region. Received 15 January 2010, accepted

Abstract = {{Most studies of King Rail (Rallus elegans) have investigated habitat use
   during the nesting season, while few comparisons have been made between
   the nesting and brood-rearing seasons. King Rails were located during
   the nesting season in Missouri using repeated surveys with call
   playback, and systematic searches for broods were conducted during the
   brood-rearing season. King Rail adults were located at twelve points in
   2006 and 14 points in 2007, and five King Rail broods were located in
   each year. Water depth was measured and dominant cover type determined
   for randomly sampled 5-m plots within used and unused habitats. Logistic
   regression models were fitted to the data and top models were selected
   from the candidate set using AIC(c). Nesting adults occurred more often
   in areas dominated by short (<= 1 m) emergent vegetation ((beta) over
   cap = 0.77 +/- 0.27) and deeper water ((beta) over cap = 0.05 +/- 0.02).
   Broods occurred more often in areas dominated by short emergent
   vegetation ((beta) over cap = 1.19 +/- 0.37) and shallow water ((beta)
   over cap = -0.17 +/- 0.06), and avoided areas dominated by tall (>1 m)
   emergent vegetation ((beta) over cap = -1.15 +/- 0.45). A modified
   catch-curve analysis was used to estimate chick daily survival rates
   during selected 7-day periods for each year. Daily survival rate ranged
   from 0.92 +/- 0.008 in late June 2007 to 0.96 +/- 0.005 in late July
   2006. Management plans for King Rails should include the different
   habitat types needed during the nesting and brood-rearing stages.

Abstract = {{Increasing populations of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   auritus; hereafter cormorants) are of concern regarding the displacement
   of other species from breeding colonies, but little is known about such
   interactions. Agonistic interactions between ground-nesting cormorants
   and American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos; hereafter
   pelicans) were investigated and compared to those involving cormorants
   and Herring Gulls (Lams argentatus). Also, a survey of cormorant eggs in
   nests of other ground-nesting species was conducted. Of 158 agonistic
   interactions between cormorants and pelicans, 83\% were threat displays,
   9\% attempts to steal nest material and 8\% involved some form of
   physical contact. Pelicans defended their nests less frequently and
   engaged in fewer physical contacts (8\%) in colonies mixed with
   cormorants compared to areas with only pelicans (33\%). Herring Gulls
   engaged in more physical contact (26\%) with cormorants in a mixed
   colony than when nesting only with other gulls (4\%). Cormorant eggs
   were found in 1-26\% of Herring and Ring-billed Gull (L. delawarensis)
   nests searched in the Great Lakes, and 0.3\% of Caspian Tern
   (Hydroprogne caspia) nests at one location. The results indicate
   cormorants routinely engage in agonistic interactions with other
   ground-nesting birds; however, the type and importance of interactions
   varies. Site-and species-specific evaluation of interactions involving
   cormorants and other birds is recommended before taking management steps
   to reduce nest site competition. Received 8 April 2010, accepted 23

Abstract = {{Thousands of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) migrate annually to
   the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA), Alaska, to undergo the
   flightless wing molt on tundra lakes and wetlands. GPS transmitters were
   attached to Brant over two summers (2007-2008) to examine patterns of
   movement and habitat use of molting Brant, including variation by
   habitat type, year and body mass. Molting Brant were located an average
   of 31 +/- 1 m (SE) from shore and this distance did not vary across any
   of the explanatory variables. Brant moved an average of 123 +/- 3 m
   hr(-1) while flightless. Movement rates varied by year, averaging 22 +/-
   12 m hr(-1) faster in 2008, and across habitat types, averaging 22 +/-
   13 m hr(-1) faster in inland versus coastal and estuarine habitats. Two
   kernel home ranges were estimated: entire home range, which encompassed
   the complete 95\% probability contour, and shoreline home range, which
   included only shoreline areas used by molting Brant. Entire home range
   (x bar = 15.1 +/- 2.2 km(2)) was negatively correlated with body mass,
   suggesting that heavier individuals have more body reserves to
   contribute to feather growth and thereby require less food and smaller
   home ranges. Conversely, shoreline home range (x bar = 4.3 +/- 0.6
   km(2)) did not vary by body mass, but rather by habitat type, being
   larger in estuarine habitats. The complex shorelines and numerous
   deltaic islands of estuarine habitats offer more shoreline per area than
   either coastal or inland habitats. Brant appear to have limited ability
   to adjust their home range size or forage further from shore in response
   to variable food resources across years or habitats, instead altering
   their movement rate. Given this apparent lack of behavioral flexibility,
   Brant may be sensitive to development-related disturbances or habitat
   losses at molt sites in the TLSA. Received 26 October 2010, accepted 11
   March 2011.}},

Abstract = {{The lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (hereafter LMAV) provides winter
   habitat for approximately 40\% of the Mississippi Flyway's Mallard (Anas
   platyrhynhcos) population; information on winter survival rates of
   female Mallards in the LMAV is restricted to data collected prior to
   implementation of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. To
   estimate recent survival and cause-specific mortality, rates in the
   LMAV, 174 radio-marked female Mallards were tracked for a total of
   11,912 exposure days. Survival varied by time periods defined by hunting
   seasons, and females with lower body condition (size adjusted body mass)
   at time of capture had reduced probability of survival. Female survival
   was less and the duration of our tracking period was greater than those
   in previous studies of similarly marked females in the LMAV; the
   product-limit survival estimate (+/- SE) through the entire tracking
   period (136 days) was 0.54 +/- 0.10. Cause-specific mortality rates were
   0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.34 +/- 0.12 for hunting and other sources of
   mortality, respectively; the estimated mortality rate from other sources
   (including those from avian, mammalian, or unknown sources) was higher
   than mortality from non-hunting sources reported in previous studies of
   Mallards in the LMAV. Models that incorporate winter survival estimates
   as a factor in Mallard population growth rates should be adjusted for
   these reduced winter survival estimates. Received 7 May 2010, accepted

Abstract = {{The interaction of aerial predators and migrant Semipalmated Sandpipers
   (Calidris pusilla) was studied at Mary's Point in the upper Bay of
   Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada, during August of 2009 and 2010. Peregrine
   Falcons (Falco peregrinus) were locally reintroduced and increased from
   one active nest site in 1989 to 27 in 2010, which coincided with a
   decline of sandpipers roosting at Mary's Point from an annual mean of
   161,000 in 1976-1982 to 15,000 or less during this study. Mean roosting
   time of flocks was 33 min (range = 10 to 40 min; N = 6). Sandpipers
   returned to the beach 1 h:36 min after high-tide (range = 1 h:10 to 2
   h:13 min; N = 5), but were soon flushed again by falcons. On ten of 19
   days, during part of the high-tide period, flocks of sandpipers remained
   in flight over the ocean. Termed Over-Ocean Flocking (OOF), this
   behavior was seen on days when spring tides inundated all beach habitat,
   and also at lower tides, which supports the hypothesis that OOF is an
   antipredator strategy intended to avoid surprise attacks by falcons near
   the shore. Raptors sighted during 128 hours afield included 226
   Peregrines, 20 Merlins (Falco columbarius) and two Sharp-shinned Hawks
   (Accipiter striatus). At 1.0-3.2 Peregrine sightings/h(-1) (mean 1.8)
   the level of disturbance is high and supports the hypothesis that the
   decline in roosting sandpipers at Mary's Point is linked to predation
   danger. Received 11 December 2010, accepted 17 March 2011.}},

Abstract = {{After near extirpation in the early 20th century, Ring-billed Gulls
   (Lures delawarensis) are currently (2009) the most abundant colonial
   waterbird nesting on the Great Lakes. Nest count data are reported from
   four decadal censuses (1976-2009) conducted by the Canadian Wildlife
   Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Numbers increased from
   305,790 nests (1976-80) to a peak of 718,887 nests (1989-90), then
   decreased to 652,664 (1997-2000) and to 585,984 nests (2007-09). Changes
   varied spatially after the second census with greatest losses (-38.6\%)
   at North Channel, Georgian Bay and northern Lake Huron colonies, and
   greatest gains (+324.2\%) at Lake Michigan colonies. A total of 472
   sites had nests in at least one census (Canada N = 319; U.S. N = 153).
   Eighteen (3.8\%) colonies had >2,000 nests in all four censuses, and had
   37.5-41.9\% of all nests in each census. Site occupancy was fluid. A
   high proportion (56.8\%, N = 268) of sites contained nests in only one
   of the four censuses, and few (N = 40,8.5\%) had nests in all censuses.
   Thirty-nine sites had >2,000 nests gains/losses between census periods;
   14 (35.9\%) were on urban/industrial lands with artificial substrates.
   Human management and predator activities at some colonies contributed to
   declines in nest numbers at these locations. Movement of breeding birds
   among colonies and changes in local food supply may have influenced
   changes in nest numbers elsewhere. Reasons for the overall nest losses
   across the Great Lakes after the second census are unknown. Received 15
   June 2010, accepted 30 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is an important region to Reddish Egrets
   (Egretta rufescens); however, current status of this species in the
   Bahamas is lacking. From 2008-2010, a breeding survey of Reddish Egrets
   was conducted in Great Inagua to 1) document breeding status, 2)
   document breeding phenology, and 3) estimate the number of breeding
   pairs. A total of 87 Reddish Egret nests on Great Inagua over two
   breeding seasons were recorded; the proportion of white, dark and
   mixed-morph nesting pairs varied but averaged (+/- S.D.) 68.4 +/- 7.5,
   18.2 +/- 2.4, and 13.4 +/- 5.1\%, respectively. Based on these surveys,
   the breeding season range extends from December to May, varying annually
   due to changes in precipitation. Territorial aggression of solitary
   nesting pairs in Reddish Egrets was observed, previously unreported for
   the Caribbean. Damage to mangrove islands from Hurricane Ike in
   September 2008 appeared to increase nesting concentrations on Lake Rosa;
   solitary nesting decreased from 36\% before, to 10\% after the
   hurricane. Because the surveys before and after the hurricane did not
   encompass the entire breeding seasons, increased concentration of
   nesting may have been influenced by other factors besides Hurricane Ike.
   Even with incomplete breeding season surveys, these estimates of nesting
   pairs indicate a >50\% decrease in number of breeding pairs of Reddish
   Egret on Great Inagua since the 1980s; this is a conservation concern as
   the population is distinct. Received 19 August 2010, accepted 4 December

Abstract = {{American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are reported to
   consume large quantities of commercial catfish in Alabama, Arkansas,
   Louisiana and Mississippi, negatively impacting aquaculture production.
   If pelicans consume a single item diet, such as catfish, nutritional
   deficiencies may result. Therefore, effects of mono- and multi-species
   diets were examined to determine nutritional impacts on pelicans in
   addition to determining if preferences for certain fish species exist.
   Twelve American White Pelicans captured in northwest Mississippi were
   used for a seven day metabolism trial followed by a two day preference
   trial. In the metabolism trial, pelicans were assigned to one of three
   treatment diets (four birds/diet): catfish only, carp only, or both
   (50\% catfish and 50\% carp). Pelicans consuming only catfish
   metabolized less thy matter, organic matter and energy than those
   consuming only carp or both. Four pelicans were used to determine
   preference for carp or catfish. Pelicans ate more (P = 0.001) carp (89\%
   of diet) and digested nutrients from carp more efficiently than they did
   from catfish. Pelicans can meet nutritional requirements by consuming a
   mono-species diet of fish; however, certain prey may be more beneficial
   and even preferred for consumption. Received 15 November 2010, accepted

Abstract = {{The Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) is at risk in several regions of
   North America and the effectiveness of multi-species marsh bird surveys
   to detect this secretive species has been questioned. A species-specific
   standardized survey protocol for Least Bitterns was developed to
   increase detection, quantify detection probability and improve knowledge
   of the species' distribution, abundance and habitat use. The protocol is
   a modification of the Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring
   Protocol (Conway 2009), whereby only the Least Bittern call is broadcast
   repeatedly at fixed point count survey stations, and a second passive
   listening period is added after the broadcast period to increase
   detection. Vocalizations and behavior are noted on a minute-by-minute
   basis for each individual Least Bittern, along with estimated distance
   at first detection. The protocol has been implemented in Canada since
   2006 and has resulted in Least Bitterns being detected in more sites and
   larger numbers than previously suspected. Adoption of the proposed
   protocol is recommended across the Least Bittern range when Least
   Bittern detection is the focus of a survey or monitoring program;
   therefore allowing direct comparisons of relative abundance and
   detection probabilities amongst sites. Received 19 February 2010,

Abstract = {{The relationship between breeding site characteristics and breeding
   parameters of Little Egrets were investigated in the Sfax salt marshes
   (salina), Tunisia. Thirty colonies distributed among 14 breeding sites
   were monitored weekly during four breeding seasons (2004-2007). The
   number of breeding pairs varied among years in parallel with the number
   of detected colonies. Regressions were used to assess whether breeding
   site surface area, vegetation cover and inaccessibility to terrestrial
   predators affected the size and reproductive success of the colonies.
   Colony size was positively related to breeding site surface area and
   vegetation cover, while site isolation was the most important predictor
   of chick productivity. The results suggest that Little Egret colony size
   in the Sfax salina is determined by availability of nesting places,
   while chick productivity is controlled by accessibility of breeding
   sites to terrestrial predators, i.e. dogs. Given these results, an
   effective management action to conserve Little Egrets in Sfax would be
   to strategically place fences to protect large and densely-vegetated
   islets from these predators. Received 9 March 2010, accepted 8 January

Abstract = {{Although Sandhill Cranes (Gras canadensis) are considered as threatened
   in Mexico, there are no details on either their present winter
   distribution or descriptions of wetlands where cranes have been
   recorded. The objective here was to update the location of their
   wintering areas in Mexico and characterize the wetlands where they roost
   in winter. The wetlands were surveyed by ground and air, covering the
   Chihuahuan Desert in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon,
   Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas and Guanajuato. Sandhill Cranes were
   recorded in 31 wetlands, of which 13 were new locations and extended the
   present distribution 237 km south. Three possible hypotheses, acting
   either individually or in combination, are proposed to explain the new
   locations. The main threats to the wetlands are their proximity to urban
   centers, disturbances to roosting areas due to human activity and
   land-use change. Some wetlands where cranes have been recorded had not
   been considered as priorities for waterfowl but would have importance
   for cranes and other species during migration and winter. Further
   studies of crane migration and wintering are important for conservation
   and management of the wetlands. Received 25 January 2010, accepted 23

Abstract = {{Nestling diets of the vulnerable Chinese Egret (Egretta eulophotes) were
   analyzed at two breeding colonies on islands off Fujian, Southern China,
   in 2007 and 2008. Fish and shrimps were the main prey, comprising 87.5\%
   and 35.4\% by frequency of occurrence in regurgitations, respectively.
   Prey in the 4-6 mm size class occurred most commonly (80.4\% of
   regurgitations). Compared with nestling diets of the Little Egret
   (Egretta garzetta) from other island heronries, nestlings of the Chinese
   Egret depended on prey that only occurred in coastal wetlands, whereas
   nestlings of the Little Egret consumed prey found in all aquatic
   habitats, including freshwater marshes; however, both species preyed on
   fish and shrimps and took prey of a similar size. The results suggest
   that coastal wetlands near the heronries need to be considered in
   habitat conservation for Chinese Egret. Received 19 July 2010, accepted
   14 October 2010.}},

Abstract = {{A system was developed for the delineation of distance intervals in
   front of an observer during seabird surveys. Delineation is based on a
   coordinates system (x:y) with the vanishing point on the horizon being
   the origin (0:0), within a vertical plane in front of the observer.
   Coordinates of parallel interval limits can be calculated using y = H
   x/d(p) (H = height of the observer's eyes; d(p) = perpendicular distance
   between transect centerline and interval limit), and coordinates of
   radial interval limits using y = H root x(2) + omega(2)(p)/d(c)
   (omega(p) = distance between the observer and the vertical plane in
   direction of interval limit; d(c) = observer's distance to the interval
   limit). The use of the delineation system will help reduce
   observer-induced variation in seabird at-sea surveys. Received 14

   Sandpiper}},
Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using constant-effort catch data, causes of annual variation in the
   timing of migration of Curlew Sandpipers (Calidris ferruginea) migrating
   through Ottenby, Sweden, as well as the trend in timing of migration
   from 1946-2005, was investigated. Variation in the timing of autumn
   migration of adult and juvenile Curlew Sandpipers was influenced by
   breeding success connected to predation pressure on the Arctic breeding
   grounds. Median migration date of adult birds was significantly later in
   good breeding years compared with poor breeding years while the
   migration of juveniles was earlier in good breeding years compared with
   poor breeding years. Also, adults migrated earlier when the average
   temperature in June was warmer. Median migration dates of adults have
   advanced by 23 days from 1946-2005, but the migration dates of juveniles
   have remained unchanged. Unchanged migration dates of juveniles indicate
   that earlier departure of the adult Curlew Sandpipers from the breeding
   grounds was not due to earlier breeding. Evidence suggests that
   declining breeding productivity as a result of increasing predation on
   broods of shorebirds might, over the years, be the reason for the
   observed pattern of early departure of adults from the breeding grounds.
   One possible consequence of earlier migration is a mismatch between
   timing of migration and periods of food abundance on migration routes
   and at the wintering grounds, leading to a decline in adult and juvenile
   survival and population size. Received 24 February 2010, accepted 30

Abstract = {{Spring-migration ecology of staging Northern Pintails, Anus acuta, was
   investigated in south-central Nebraska, USA. Habitat associations, local
   movements, settling patterns, arrival dates, residency times and
   survival were estimated from 71 radiomarked pintails during spring 2001,
   2003 and 2004, and diet determined from 130 females collected during
   spring 1998 and 1999. Seventy-two percent of pintail diurnal locations
   were in palustrine wetlands, 7\% in riverine wetlands, 3\% in lacustrine
   wetlands, 6\% in municipal sewage lagoons and irrigation reuse pits and
   10.5\% in croplands. Emergent wetlands with hemi-marsh conditions were
   used diurnally more often than wetlands with either open or closed
   vegetation structures. Evening foraging flights averaged 4.3 km (SE =
   0.6) and 72\% were to cornfields. In accord with these findings, 87\% of
   93 pintails collected during spring 1998 and 1999 returning to evening
   roosts consumed corn, which represented 84\% dry mass of all foods.
   Pintails collected on non-cropped wetlands ingested invertebrates and
   seeds from wetland plants more frequently than birds returning to roost.
   Radiomarked pintails arrived in Nebraska on 7 March 2003 and 18 February
   2004; average arrival date was six days earlier during 2004 compared to
   2003. Residency time for individuals varied greatly (1-40 days) yet
   yearly means were similar and averaged 9.5 clays within the region. No
   mortality was detected for 71 birds monitored over 829 exposure days.
   Conservation planners linking population dynamics and habitat conditions
   at spring-staging areas need to focus on pintail body condition during
   spring and its connection with reproductive success and survival during
   the breeding season. Received 5 March 2010, accepted 29 April 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Population structure of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionic-us histrionicus)
   wintering in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, was evaluated by
   generating age, sex, paired status and distance-specific movement rates
   with multi-stratum mark-recapture analyses, and age and sex-specific
   movement distances through surveys of marked individuals. Annual
   movement distances and rates did not differ by sex, but only 2-4\% of
   adults (third year and after-third year) compared to 7-11\% of subadults
   (hatch year and second year) moved among locations per year and distance
   moved decreased with age. Adults were highly site faithful regardless of
   sex and paired status. The stepping stone gene flow model estimated the
   among population component of genetic variance (F-ST) at 0.005,
   suggesting that winter movement by subadults was sufficient to explain
   results of previous genetic analyses that detected no fine scale genetic
   structuring. Seasonal movement rates indicated that at least 95\% of
   individuals molt and winter in the same location, and that annual
   aggregation at Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasi) spawning sites
   facilitates demographic mixing and gene flow. Low annual movement rates
   (0.001) between the northern and southern Strait of Georgia and
   dispersal by both sexes suggest that a metapopulation distribution may
   function within the Pacific Coast range, which is relevant to the
   geographic scale of management. Movement rates and distances suggest
   that subadult survival rates are particularly vulnerable to
   underestimation. Received 28 February 2010, accepted 3 June 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Ten geolocators (light-level data loggers) were attached to Common Terns
   (Sterna hirundo) at a breeding site in the northeastern USA in 2007 and
   2008; six were retrieved (five with useful data) in 2008 and 2009. The
   birds wintered in four discrete areas on the north and east coasts of
   South America, from Guyana (6-7 degrees N) to northeastern Argentina
   (36-42 degrees S); three remained within restricted areas for most or
   all of the winter, whereas two ranged more widely. They left the
   breeding area at various dates between 1 August and 14 September; three
   migrated directly from the breeding area while two first moved southwest
   to stage near Cape Hatteras. All five birds flew directly to the
   vicinity of Puerto Rico, then moved along the north and east coasts of
   South America, staging at scattered locations for periods of 3-11 d,
   before reaching their winter quarters at various dates from 6 September
   to 26 October. Two birds left their winter quarters on 2 March and 4
   April, staged in northern Brazil for 47 and 6 d, then traveled via the
   Bahamas to reach the breeding site on 1 May. During breeding and
   post-breeding periods, the birds spent a mean of 7 min each day and
   virtually no time at night resting on the water, but during the rest of
   the year they often rested on the water for up to 6 h by day and up to
   11 h at night. Leg-mounted geolocators caused several adverse effects
   but did not reduce survival. Received 26 February 2010, accepted 29

Abstract = {{Two invertebrates, brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) and brine flies
   (Ephydridae), occur in great densities in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) but
   it is unknown whether ducks forage extensively on them during winter or
   rely on freshwater food. Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Northern
   Shoveler (Anas clypeata) and Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) were
   collected from the GSL during winters 2004-05 and 2005-06 to evaluate
   their food habits. Brine shrimp and brine flies comprised more than 70\%
   of the winter diet of these ducks. Common Goldeneyes consumed mainly
   brine fly larvae (68\% based on dry weight biomass), which live
   primarily along the substrate. Northern Shovelers fed on brine shrimp
   cysts (52\%) and adult brine shrimp (20\%) while Green-winged Teal
   consumed mainly brine shrimp cysts (80\%). In some years, up to half of
   the brine shrimp cysts in the GSL are commercially harvested. Care
   should be taken so that this commercial harvest does not adversely
   impact ducks that depend on these brine shrimp cysts for winter food.

Abstract = {{The incidence of lead shot, ingestion in waterfowl has declined in the
   lower Great Lakes (LGL) following the 1999 Canada-wide ban on use of
   toxic shot for waterfowl hunting, but few data exist on ingestion
   frequencies of spent shot or fishing weights for sea ducks wintering at
   the LGL. Artifact ingestion was evaluated in 269 Buffleheads (Bucephala
   albeola), 224 Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula) and 256 Long-tailed Ducks
   (Clangula hyemalis) collected at Lake Ontario during winter 2002-03 and
   2003-04. Long-tailed Ducks ingested total shot (lead and steel shot
   combined) more frequently (6.6\%) than did Common Goldeneye (1.8\%) and
   Bufflehead (0.4\%). Lead shot was ingested by Long-tailed Ducks (5.1\%)
   and Buffleheads (0.4\%), but not by Common Goldeneyes. One Long-tailed
   Duck, 0.1\% of all specimens, ingested one lead fishing weight.
   Substrate type influenced artifact ingestion frequency and diving ducks
   that specialize on prey associated with hard substrates may continue to
   ingest artifacts more than ducks using soft substrate marshes. The
   results suggest lead toxicosis from spent shotgun pellets is presently
   non-existent to low in sea ducks wintering at northeastern Lake Ontario
   and that further restrictions on use of lead fishing tackle may have
   little implication for sea ducks in this region. Received 12 March 2010,

Abstract = {{A free-ranging Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population was investigated
   during winter (December-January 1996-1999) below the Garrison Dam, North
   Dakota, USA, to relate diet to gut morphology, variation in males. Four
   explanatory variables (fish consumption, male age, winter, and body
   size) were evaluated as to whether they influenced five response
   variables associated with gut characteristics of Mallards. Response
   variables were lower gastro-intestinal tract mass (LGIT), dry liver
   mass, dry gizzard mass, small intestine length, and ceca length. Diets
   of Mallards were comprised primarily of Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax)
   and concomitantly variation in gizzard mass was small. LGIT mass of
   juveniles was larger than that of adults, greater for those that
   consumed fish, and greater during the coldest and snowiest winter. Liver
   mass and small intestine length of Mallards that consumed fish were
   greater than those that did not. Mallards may maintain lengthy
   intestines to increase digestive efficiency. Gut size variation was not
   entirely attributable to dietary composition but also influenced by body
   size and environmental conditions such that over-winter survival is
   maximized. Received 1 December 2009, accepted 9 December 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Access to human-derived food is thought the major cause of population
   increases in many gull species, and the degree to which urbanized gulls
   depend upon anthropogenic food may be resolved by isotopic benchmarks.
   Stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were compared between
   Silver Gulls breeding at a remote, non-urbanized site (Furneaux Island
   Group, Bass Strait) and those at an urban (Hobart) colony in Tasmania to
   distinguish potential differences in feeding regime. Analyses of whole
   blood stable isotopes revealed that non-urbanized gulls tended to have a
   mixed diet from several sources, while urban gulls fed on a separate
   food web from and a more freshwater origin. No differences in the stable
   isotope ratios were detected between sexes or among breeding periods.
   Birds from Hobart tended to feed at a higher trophic position after
   egg-laying than before, and reflected a change in food preference. These
   results provided critical baseline data to measure the degree of
   urbanization of Silver Gulls in Tasmania in order to study potential
   health impacts of anthropogenic food on birds. Received 27 January 2010,
   accepted 24 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The Crab Plover (Dromas ardeola) is a little-known shorebird that breeds
   colonially in self-dug burrows on islands in the north-western Indian
   Ocean. To test whether the ``nest site limitation{''} hypothesis could
   satisfactorily explain the high nest density in this species, 21
   colonies were studied in Eritrea from 2002 to 2009. The hypothesis was
   falsified by the following observations: across the study period,
   nesting colonies were relocated on the same sandbanks every year and
   most occupied no more than 4\% of the area suitable for excavating
   burrows; colony size and area suitable for burrowing were not
   correlated; nest density and colony size were not significantly
   correlated; the area occupied by nests increased steadily throughout the
   nest-building period; nests were closely-spaced throughout the building
   phase rather than being scattered throughout the area eventually used
   for digging. These results indicate that the Crab Plover is not
   site-limited but a truly colonial species. Received 9 March 2010,

Abstract = {{The breeding success of Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Pelagic
   Cormorants (Phalocrocorax pelagicus) at Triangle Island, off British
   Columbia, Canada, was high from 2003 to 2006; four years in which a pair
   of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) nested in the vicinity However,
   in three years when the falcon eyrie was inactive (2007 to 2009), adult
   murres were depredated on the colony by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus) and murre eggs were taken by Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus
   glaucescens) after eagles flushed incubating murres. Consequently,
   breeding success in both species was low in 2007, then in 2008 and 2009
   no murres bred successfully and no cormorants built nests. That a single
   pair of falcons protected thousands of seabirds is noteworthy for its
   local conservation implications. Bottom-up control of seabird breeding
   success has been well documented, but there appears need for a better
   understanding of the role of top-down mechanisms as a result of both the
   direct (consumptive) and indirect (non-consumptive) effects of top
   predators. Received 13 March 2010, accepted 26 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were not observed
   breeding in the inner coast of Washington and British Columbia until the
   1920s and 1930s, whether the breeding was either a re-colonizing event
   or a new expansion was unknown. Archaeological evidence from Watmough
   Bay, a shell midden site on Lopez Island, San Juan Islands (Washington
   State), was analyzed to place the recent changes in breeding
   distribution in deeper historical context. The Watmough Bay faunal
   assemblage contains large numbers (n= 2,397) of cormorant bones. Of
   those specimens that could be identified to species (n = 358), 99.7\%
   were identified as Double-crested Cormorants. The majority (97\%, n =
   2,336) of the cormorant remains are from juveniles or chicks, which were
   collected while still at the colony. Radiocarbon dating indicates the
   majority of the site accumulated between AD 300-600. Evidence for a ca.
   1,500-year-old Double-crested Cormorant colony near Lopez Island
   confirms that the species did breed in the region prior to the early
   20th century. The study further documents the value of archaeological
   data for current wildlife management. Received 15 January 2010, accepted

Abstract = {{The Nebraska Sandhills are an important area for breeding ducks in the
   Great Plains, but reliable estimates of breeding populations are
   unavailable. Double-observer methodology was used to estimate abundance
   of breeding duck populations in the Nebraska Sandhills. Aerial transect
   surveys were conducted using methodology similar to the cooperative
   Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey conducted by the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service and Canadian Wildlife Service. Observations by
   two front-seat observers and one rear-seat observer were used to account
   for incomplete detectability. Transect-specific population size and
   detection probabilities were estimated using program SURVIV; estimates
   were species-specific by type of social grouping. Regional population
   sizes were obtained by extrapolating transects' estimates to the
   Sandhills. Detection probabilities were high (>0.75) for all species,
   but highest for Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata) and Gadwall (A.
   strepera). Detection probabilities generally followed increases or
   decreases with duck densities. Uncorrected population estimates, on
   average, were <7\% the population estimates obtained by correcting for
   detectability. Double-observer methodology should be considered for
   adjusting duck counts that cannot be corrected using additional aerial
   or ground surveys, particularly where water and ducks are well
   dispersed. Received 19 April 2010, accepted 24 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Birds at-sea increase body mass as a consequence of food consumption and
   plumage wettability. However, little is known about the effect of
   maximum extra load on takeoff of aquatic birds. Experimental evaluation
   of maximum load-lift during takeoff was performed on a wing-propelled
   diver with high wing loading, Cassin's Auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus,
   and on a surface feeder with low wing loading, Leach's Storm-Petrel
   Oceanodroma leucarhoa. Leach's Storm-Petrel supported a maximum extra
   load of 45\% of its body mass, and that of Cassin's Anklet was 25\%. The
   relation of maximal load to food transport and plumage wettability
   indicates that the storm-petrel and the alcid maintain safety load
   margins of 31\% and 8\% of the maximum supported extra load during
   takeoff, respectively. Load margin showed by storm-petrels suggests an
   enhanced flight performance, increasing specific lift during foraging;
   meanwhile that of auklets allows for reduction of specific buoyancy
   during diving. Received 1 February 2010, accepted 31 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic Terns show large variations in colony attendance between breeding
   seasons, making comparable counts of colony size complex and population
   status estimates difficult. Here, three areas in two regions of
   Greenland were surveyed in consecutive breeding seasons between 2002 and
   2009. Between-year variation in population size in the small and
   mid-sized Arctic Tern colonies in West Greenland was considerable (mean
   CV of individual colonies 117.5\%, CV of total 49.6\%). In the largest
   colony in Greenland, Kitsissunnguit, overall colony size showed minor
   variations (CV 14.6\%), but variation in numbers was pronounced at the
   sub-colony level (mean CV 47.4\%). When combining the surveyed colonies
   in West Greenland, the total population size varied little (CV 6.7\%)
   and less than expected if colonies fluctuated independently (P= 0.023),
   indicating that local movements between the colonies took place and
   annual variation was linked to local rather than to large-scale
   phenomena. In Northeast Greenland, complete breeding failure, likely
   caused by Arctic Fox, was recorded in two out of four seasons. Future
   Greenland Arctic Tern colony monitoring should either 1) survey multiple
   colonies within the same season covering adjoining colonies over a
   larger area, or 2) survey one large, representative colony M multiple
   years in order to track potential changes in population size. Received

Abstract = {{Effective conservation and management of Bar-headed Geese (Anser

   determine their migration routes. Of the tagged geese, eight left
   Qinghai Lake and began autumn migration. Of these eight, four completed
   their autumn migration, lasting 50 to 90 days, using one of two
   migration routes to their wintering grounds near Caohai Lake in Guizhou
   Province, Yarlung Zangbo valley in Tibet, and Kohima in India. The
   tagged geese each stopped at three to four sites and traveled 1,270 to
   1,470 km from their breeding to wintering grounds. Wetlands at Muli
   Marsh, Zhaling, Eling and Galalacuo Lakes in Qinghai Province, Nagqu and

Abstract = {{Various mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce incidental
   seabird mortality in longline and trawl fisheries but little attention
   has been given to artisanal fishing. In the 2008/09 breeding season,
   during a study of foraging of Humboldt, Spheniscus humboldti, and
   Magellanic Penguins, S. magellanicus, breeding on Punihuil islets,
   southern Chile, a Magellanic Penguin equipped with a time-depth recorder
   became entangled and subsequently drowned in a gill net set for Corvina
   Drum (Cilia gilberti). The device was returned by fishermen and the data
   appear to be the first documented case of such a drowning in a marine,
   air-breathing vertebrate. According to the data, while diving to a depth
   of more than 50 in, the bird became entangled and drowned, remaining
   below 60 m for nearly 21 hours until the net was hauled. Although only a
   single incident is reported, there are indications that incidental
   mortality of penguins, other seabirds and marine mammals is more common
   in artisanal fisheries than previously anticipated. Received 20 April
   2010, accepted 5 July 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Jabiru Stork (Jabiru mycteria) is listed under Appendix I of CITES and
   considered threatened in Central America. The first population genetic
   analysis of Jabiru Storks was carried out using mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) control region sequences (520 bp) mid live heterologous
   microsatellite loci. Samples were collected from the field (N = 49) and
   museum skins (N = 22) in Central (mainly Belize, Nicaragua and Costa
   Rica) and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil). A
   decline of mtDNA diversity was observed in comparisons between past (N =
   20) and present (N = 40) samples collected in Central America and
   northern South America. Similar levels of microsatellite loci diversity
   were observed among contemporary samples. Lower levels of mtDNA
   variability were observed in samples from Central America and northern
   South America when compared to the Brazilian Pantanal region.
   Significant levels of genetic differentiation were found between
   contemporary locations sampled, whereas non-significant results were
   observed for historic samples. The non-geographic association of
   haplotypes observed at the cladograms and the recent divergence times
   estimated between locations are indicative of an evolutionary history of
   a large population size with limited population structure. Reconnection
   of populations via increased gene flow, particularly in Central America,
   is recommended if genetic structure and status are to be restored.

Abstract = {{The need for better understanding of migratory movements of wild birds
   in Asia promoted an evaluation of the usefulness of deuterium in
   feathers (delta D-f) to assign origins. Feathers were sampled from
   Bar-headed Geese (Anser indicus), Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus),
   Mongolian Gulls (Lams vegae mongolicus), Curlew Sandpipers (Calidris
   ferruginea) and Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva) in north-central
   Mongolia, from June to September 2007. Univariate statistical analyses
   were performed to test for differences between study sites for all
   species and between growing (blood) and previously grown (non-blood)
   feathers only for Bar-headed Geese. Values of delta D-f in actively
   growing feathers generally agreed with those expected from integrated
   isotopic signals in precipitation expected for sampling sites. Values of
   delta D-f from adult migrant birds also indicated varying degrees of
   movement from north to south expected from the movement of these species
   in Asia. These results show promise for the isotope approach for
   establishing origins of molt of migratory waterbirds in Asia in a
   cost-effective manner without the need for mark and recapture. Projects
   required to track movements of waterbirds in Asia could benefit by
   incorporating this approach into study design. However, greater
   refinement of the delta D-f isoscape for Asia is now needed. Received 18
   January 2010, accepted 27 June 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behavior, physiological state and site fidelity of resident
   (sedentary) and migratory American Dippers (Cinclus mexicanus) were
   compared to assess whether differences in over-wintering behavior or
   physiology explain the lower annual survival rate of resident
   individuals. Residents spent inure time resting (23 vs. 14\% oldie time)
   and less time foraging (71 vs. 81\% of the time) than migrants. However,
   there were no detectable differences in energetic intake (kJ/hr),
   foraging success (kJ/hr spent foraging), or physiological state
   (measured as size-corrected mass, hematocrit, leucocrit, total white
   blood cell count, and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio; immuno-globulin,
   triglyceride, and free glycerol levels; and total antioxidant. capacity
   and total oxidative status of plasma). Foraging success, size-corrected
   mass and plasma triglyceride levels increased with date for both
   migrants and residents, indicating that both groups built up fat
   reserves as winter progressed. Resident individuals exhibited higher
   winter site fidelity than migrants (sighted on the same section of the
   river on 70 vs. 53\% of weekly censuses). The lower site fidelity and,
   hence, greater movement of migrants may increase survival by allowing
   them to seek more suitable microhabitats during adverse conditions.
   Further work on the relationship between mortality rates, movement and
   winter home range size of migrant and resident dippers is needed to test
   the latter hypothesis. Received 6 July 2009, accepted 17 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about seabird distributions at night. Densities of
   Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus, hereafter ``murrelets{''})
   and potential prey were determined along fixed-width transects in spring
   and summer of 2007 and 2008, and compared during night and day in two
   regions of Port Snettisham, near Juneau, Southeast Alaska. Murrelets
   moved from a shallower, more sheltered inner region, used during the
   clay for foraging and staging for inland flights (2007 night densities =
   15 +/- 13 murrelets.km(2); 2007 day densities = 172 +/- 67
   murrelets.km(2)), to a deeper, more exposed outer region, further from
   shore, during dark hours (2007 night densities = 113 +/- 61
   murrelets.km(2); 2007 day densities = 41 +/- 23 murrelets.km(2)). Prey
   school density and relative prey density were significantly higher at
   night in the inner region compared with the outer region (2.2 times
   higher prey school density and 3.8 times higher relative prey density),
   suggesting that murrelets were not redistributing themselves to forage
   on fish prey. A more likely explanation for why murrelets move front day
   use areas to night use areas is to avoid predators such as Bald Eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) and
   various mammals. Received 28 June 2009, accepted 11 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal structure of the waterbird community on the Mar
   Mellor coastal lagoon (SE Spain) was analyzed in relation to
   environmental gradients from October 2006-March 2008. Waterbirds were
   censused as 20 sampling stations according to a zonation scheme based on
   degree of confinement and primary production, and subsequently modified
   to match bird use at the landscape level. Multivariate classification
   and ordination techniques (MDS and SIMPER) identified indicator species
   and displayed their association with environmental vectors. Abundance of
   waterbirds increased latitudinally, southward in winter and vice versa
   in summer. Greater abundance and diversity were found in the southern
   half of the lagoon in winter, where grebes, gulls and cormorants
   predominated, and in the northern half in summer, where gulls and terns
   were dominant. A latitudinal distribution of species was observed; the
   northern half characterized by Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus) and
   the southern half by Great-crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and Great
   Cormorant (Pholacrocorax carbo). Such distribution patterns seem to
   respond to internal functional gradients of the lagoon as well as
   physical structure of the habitat and human activities. The results show
   that waterbirds can be incorporated into a monitoring scheme as
   integrative indicators of spatial gradients of environmental
   deterioration in the lagoon. In addition, the interpretation of
   ecological preferences and the response of waterbirds to environmental
   pressures can serve to assess the conservation status of species at
   local or regional scales, and act as a warning tool for changes in
   similar ecosystems. Received 2 September 2009, accepted 17 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Information on nest-activity patterns and energetic costs during the
   breeding season may shed light on current population trends of Great
   Egrets (Ardea alba). To address the issue, Great Egrets nesting in a
   mixed-species colony in Wichita, Kansas, were studied from May-July in
   2008 and 2009. A total of 35 h of scan samples at 28 random nests
   resulted in 5,062 instantaneous records; a separate 62 h of observations
   recorded 75 food-provisioning intervals. Adults at the nest engaged
   mainly in low-cost activities such as sitting, standing and preening,
   but activity patterns differed significantly by nest content. Adults
   with eggs spent significantly more time sitting but less time standing,
   preening or away from the nest. Overall variation in activity patterns
   among the 28 study nests was not significant. Food-provisioning
   intervals ranged from 6-480 min, with a median duration of 180 min.
   Intervals declined significantly with chick stage, were longer during
   periods of high wind velocity, and varied by time of day.
   Food-provisioning intervals for adults with eggs averaged > 80 min
   longer than for those with chicks of all sizes. The results suggest that
   Great Egrets engage in low-cost activities and minimize energy costs
   while at the nest, and adjust the pattern of food-provisioning trips in
   response to proximate conditions and increased food demand. Received 29
   November 2009, accepted 26 August 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Research on breeding American Oystercatchers has focused on identifying
   factors that affect reproductive success but little attention has been
   paid to parent behavior during chick-rearing. Parental attendance of
   American Oystercatchers was measured in Bulls Bay and along the Atlantic
   Intracoastal Waterway (Waterway) within the Cape Romain Region, South
   Carolina, USA, during 2006. Parental attendance rates averaged 90.9\% in
   Bulls Bay and 81.4\% along the Waterway. Daily survival of chicks was
   higher in Bulls Bay (0.989 +/- 0.007) compared to the Waterway (0.966
   +/- 0.012). The extent of shellfish reefs (i.e. foraging areas) adjacent
   to nest sites was greater in Bulls Bay (5,633 +/- 658 m(2)) compared to
   the Waterway (3,273 +/- 850 m(2)). Mean parental attendance in Bulls Bay
   was higher for successful broods (90.5\%) compared to failed broods
   (79.8\%). In contrast, mean parental attendance along the Waterway was
   higher for failed broods (93.4\%) compared to successful broods
   (67.5\%). Less extensive shellfish reefs adjacent to nest sites along
   the Waterway appeared to require parents to depart more frequently to
   forage and the resultant reduction in attendance may have negatively
   affected cluck survival. Bulls Bay may provide higher quality nesting
   habitat compared to the Waterway with respect to proximity to food
   resources and parental attendance. Management and conservation efforts
   for American Oystercatchers should consider the relationship between
   foraging and nesting habitat and variability in behavioral attributes,
   such as parental attendance, in relationship to environmental conditions
   which ultimately affect reproductive success. Received 10 November 2009,

Abstract = {{Annual apparent survival rates from 323 marked immature Magnificent
   Frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) were estimated using mark-recapture
   models for live encounter data in a six-year study (1998-2003) at Isla
   Isabel, the largest breeding colony in Western Mexico. A time and age
   immature apparent survival pattern was found: high and variable as
   yearling-juveniles (mean (phi) over cap (1)(1998-2000) = 0.78 +/- 0.22)
   and, later, moderate and constant as juvenile-subadults and subadults
   (mean (phi) over cap (2+) = 0.62 +/- 0.11). Whereas resighting rate (p)
   increased with time (range = 0.00 {[}+/- 0.04] -0.87 {[}+/- 0.11]). The
   results suggest variation in true survival and emigration during the
   juvenile life phase, high true survival and high site fidelity of
   juvenile-subadults and subadults during the interval after marking, and
   constant and either low true survival or high emigration in the
   subsequent intervals. Frigatebird apparent survival was predominantly
   higher in yearling juveniles than in subsequent age classes, an uncommon
   occurrence in other seabirds but likely with important demographic
   implications for species with long post-parental care and delayed
   maturity. Received 13 October 2009, accepted 9 March 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding success of the Arabian/Indian race of the Western Reef Heron
   Egretta gularis schistacea was studied in the Hara Biosphere Reserve,
   Persian Gulf, during 2008 and 2009, with 103 and 137 nests studied,
   respectively. Marked nests were checked at least twice a week to note
   egg-laying date, clutch size, brood size, egg loss and chick mortality.
   Also, hatching;Hid breeding success were estimated. Egg-laying was from
   21 March to 17 April in 2008 and from 28 March to 28 April in 2009. Mew
   clutch size in the two years combined was 3.4 +/- 0.05 and significantly
   greater in 2009 (3.5 +/- 0.07) than 2008 (3.2 +/- 0.07). Mean brood size
   was 2.0 +/- 0.1 for all clutches and was greater in 2008. The internal
   diameter of nests, the height of nests from the ground and the distance
   of nests from the mangrove forest border were important factors
   influencing breeding success. The percentage of successful nests varied
   significantly between the two years (80\% in 2008 and 51 \% in 2009).
   Overall, approximately 64\% of nests were successful in producing at
   least one fledgling. Mean hatching and breeding success were 0.6 +/-
   0.02 and 0.5 +/- 0.02, respectively. Both measures of success were lower
   in 2009 than in 2008, probably clue to weather and egg predation by the
   Black Rat Rattus rattus which was responsible for about 50\% of nest
   failures in the two years of the study. Mechanical control methods are
   suggested to reduce the negative effects of this rodent on breeding
   colonies of Western Reef Heron. Received 18 September 2009, accepted 14

Abstract = {{The Norwegian population of the nominate subspecies of Lesser
   Black-backed Gull, Larus fuscus fuscus, has declined strongly but the
   causes are unknown. The diet of these gulls breeding in two regions on
   coast of northern Norway was assessed over five years (2005-2009). In
   the southern region, chicks (n = 58) were fed predominantly gadoids
   (similar to 75\% ABP {[}aggregated percentage of prey biomass] and
   similar to 80\% frequency; 70-130 mm length), probably saithe,
   Pollachius virens, whereas 0-group herring, Clupea harelips (40-50 mm
   length) accounted for similar to 20\% ABP and were fed to similar to
   20\% of the chicks. In the northern region (n = 23), slightly larger
   0-group herring comprised similar to 60\% of the prey mass and were fed
   to 65\% of the chicks. In this area, gadoids and sanded, Ammodytes spp.,
   each accounted for similar to 17\% ABP of prey, and were fed to 20\% and
   30\% of the chicks, respectively. Other species made up smaller
   proportions of chick diets. For adults, only regurgitated pellets (28 in
   the southern region) were available. Of 23 pellets from 2006 and 2007,
   17 (74\%) contained pipefish (probably Snake Pipefish, Entelurus
   aequoreus), whereas three contained herring, two gadoids, and one
   sandeel. In the poor breeding season of 2009, adult gulls also fed on
   blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, crabs (Brachyura), sea urchins
   (Echinoidea) and seabird eggs. Thus, Northern Lesser Black-backed Gulls
   are probably mainly piscivorous during breeding, and other prey are
   probably exploited only when fish are not readily available. Further,

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, flocks of tens of thousands of Razorbills (Alca torda),
   greatly outnumbering the local breeding population and, so of unknown
   origin were observed wintering off the island of Grand Manan, Bay of
   Fundy, Canada. To determine their origin, 39 radio transmitters were
   deployed on Razorbills at major breeding centers at Corossol Island (n =
   10), Quebec, the Gannet Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador (n = 15), and
   a colony near the overwintering at-ea at Machias Seal Island (n = 14) in
   2007. From January-March 2008, flights around Grand Manan detected 19
   transmitter-fitted birds - twelve from Machias Seal Island, five from
   Corossol Island and two front the Gannet Islands. The findings confirm
   that Razorbills making up the wintering flocks off Grand Manan are not
   only local birds but also birds from major centers of the North American
   breeding distribution. Therefore, North American Razorbills from all
   breeding areas are vulnerable to mismanagement of the Bay of Fundy
   ecosystem, already degraded by over-exploitation and threatened by
   pollution from a variety of energy developments. Received January 27
   2010, accepted 17 June 2010.}},

Abstract = {{While conducting research examining the impact of American White
   Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) on the aquaculture industry in the
   southeastern United States, an apparent age and sex bias was observed
   among captured and collected pelicans. Data from 284 pelicans captured
   or collected at loafing sites located near aquaculture ponds during 1998
   to 2009 were analyzed. A sampling bias could suggest segregation of
   pelicans by sex or age on wintering grounds. Captured pelicans were
   strongly biased towards immature males (73\%) and collected pelicans
   were male biased (38\% Adult Male, 47\% Immature Male). Although the
   underlying mechanisms are not understood, observed pelican use of
   loafing areas may be related to numerous, readily available prey at
   aquaculture facilities. Received 21 December 2009, accepted 25 February
   2010.}},
