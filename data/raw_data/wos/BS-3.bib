Abstract = {{Minimum densities of Whitethroats Sylvia communis were estimated from
   409 point counts at five sites in the Sahel zone of northern Nigeria
   during March-April 1995. Higher densities occurred in woodland than on
   farmland, open rangeland or semi-desert. Within woodland Whitethroats
   were seen more frequently in Balanites aegyptiaca than would be expected
   from its relative availability. Balanites aegyptiaca had the densest
   canopy and highest density of invertebrates, suggesting that the
   preference of Whitethroats for this tree may be because if offers the
   best protection from predators, heat and/or the best foraging
   opportunities. The presence or absence of Whitethroats within a point
   was, however, best predicted by high tree species diversity rather than
   foliage volume, canopy volume or free density (though all of these
   factors were correlated). If seems likely, therefore, that diverse,
   relatively undegraded Sahelian woodland is a preferred habitat for
   Whitethroats during the spring migration period.}},

Abstract = {{Over the period 1967-97, eggs from 630 Merlin clutches, obtained in
   various parts of Britain, were analysed for residues of DDE (from DDT),
   HEOD (from aldrin and dieldrin), PCBs (industrial polychlorinated
   biphenyls) and Hg (mercury). The organochlorine pesticides (DDE and
   HEOD) had previously been held responsible for an earlier decline in the
   numbers of Merlins in Britain, along with some other birds of prey.
   During the study period, these residues declined markedly PCB levels
   showed declines in some regions but not in others, while mercury levels
   (measured only from 1978) declined to the mid-1980s and then increased
   again. The decline in pesticide residues, and associated improvement in
   shell indices, coincided with a marked increase between 1983-84 and
   1993-94 in the numbers of Merlins found breeding in Britain.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to extend the breeding range of the Red Kite within the
   United Kingdom, 93 (48 males and 45 females) juvenile Red Kites,
   originating from Spain, Sweden and Wales, were released in southern
   England in 1989-94, and 93 (52 males, 40 females and one unsexed)
   juvenile Red Kites, originating from Sweden, were released in northern
   Scotland in 1989-93. Minimum estimates far first-year survival were
   83.1\% and 78.0\% for male and female Red Kites in England, and 50.0\%
   and 52.5\% in Scotland, respectively. Annual survival then improved in
   the second and third years. Several sick or injured birds were
   recaptured, treated and returned to the wild, and some of these
   eventually bred. In their first year, birds released in Scotland tended
   to disperse greater distances than those released in England, females
   travelled further than males, and birds released during the early years
   dispersed further than those released during the later years. Successful
   breeding started in 1992 in England and Scotland. The mean age of first
   breeding was 1.9 years and 2.6 years for males and 1.8 years and 1.7
   years for females in England and Scotland, respectively There was a
   minimum of 59 clutches laid in England and 29 in Scotland in 1991-95.
   Clutch size averaged 2.9 (England) and 3.0 (Scotland), fledged brood
   size per breeding pair was 1.9 (England) and 1.6 (Scotland), and fledged
   brood size per successful pair was 2.3 (England) and 2.2 (Scotland).
   Demographic parameters were used to construct deterministic models for
   population growth. At current rates of growth, it is predicted that the
   English and Scottish populations will exceed 100 breeding pairs by 1998
   and 2007, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The numbers and breeding success of the Stone Curlew Burhinus
   oedicnemus, a rare bird in the UK, were studied on chalk downland at
   Porton Down, Wiltshire, from 1987 to 1996. The number of pairs varied
   annually between nine and 19 and was positively correlated with spring
   counts of Rabbits in the current and previous years. This correlation
   probably results from a previously documented preference for very short
   vegetation strewn with small stones created by grazing and soil
   disturbance by Rabbits. The average number of young fledged per pair was
   adequate to main tain a stable population, but varied by an order of
   magnitude among years. Annual variation in chick survival had the
   largest influence on variation in overall productivity because breeding
   failures at the egg stage were usually replaced. Differences in chick
   survival among years were not correlated with the mean rate of growth of
   chicks. Nest success and overall breeding success were positively
   correlated with a spring Rabbit count and,for nest success, there was
   also a negative effect of the number of Foxes culled per unit effort,
   which may be an index of Fox numbers. The effect of Rabbit abundance
   might occur because predators only seek out Stone Curlew eggs and chicks
   when Rabbits are scarce. It is recommended that the high Rabbit
   population is maintained as this appears to be beneficial to Stone
   Curlews breeding on seminatural grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1992 and 1993 over 600 000 ha of arable farmland in the UK were
   set aside under a production control mechanism of the Common
   Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union. One of the management
   options for this set-aside land was to leave it as an over-winter fallow
   with a naturally regenerated green cover. This study was designed to
   test whether such land was used by seed-eating bird species, populations
   of many of which have undergone recent severe declines. Five out of six
   declining species recorded in the study were found in significantly
   greater numbers on this habitat than would be expected if the birds were
   randomly distributed over the farmland landscape. The results of this
   study, covering a wide geographical area, reinforce previous findings of
   the importance of winter food sources, particularly over-winter stubble
   fields, to declining farmland seed-eaters. Proposed changes to the CAP
   under Agenda 2000 include the reduction of the obligatory set-aside rate
   to zero. These results suggest that such a move might be detrimental to
   populations of declining farmland birds. There is an urgent need for an
   agri-environment scheme designed to integrate arable production and
   conservation objectives, which operates in the wider countryside,
   includes provision for over-winter stubble fields and is available to
   every arable farmer.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{174-183}},

Abstract = {{The St Kilda archipelago is a World Heritage Site holding
   internationally important populations of a number of seabird species.
   Great Skuas first bred at St Kilda in 1963, and numbers there rose
   steadily until 1990. Since then, a rapid expansion has occurred, with
   the population size increasing on Hirta, the main island in the
   archipelago, at a rate of 22.1\% per annum between 1994 and 1997. In
   total, 233 pairs were occupying territories at St Kilda in 1997 A simple
   model suggests that as many as 50\% of the birds recruited to Hirta
   between 1994 and 1997 were immigrants from other colonies. Comparison of
   breeding data collected in different areas gave no indication that the
   higher nest density resulting from the recent influx was having any
   detrimental effect on annual productivity and it seems likely that Great
   Skuas will continue to increase, at least in the near future. Given the
   importance of seabird prey in the diet of Great Skuas at St Kilda, the
   continued expansion in numbers of this species gives some cause for
   concern. However, because immigration plays a large role in the
   population dynamics of Great Skuas at this site, any attempts to limit
   population growth by small-scale culling of adults or reduction of
   reproductive output is unlikely to succeed, and might result in a
   decline in recruitment at other colonies of this rare and vulnerable
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial nest predation experiments were carried out in northern Italy
   in woods which varied in size, isolation and surrounding landscape
   structure. Multivariate analyses, including logistic regression, showed
   that: (1) size and isolation of woods did not significantly affect
   predation rates; (2) nests on the edge of woods did not suffer higher
   predation rates than nests inside the wood; (3) nest camouflage greatly
   influenced predation rates, suggesting that predators were mainly using
   visual clues to identify nests; (4) the type of habitat that surrounded
   the woods emerged as a crucial factor in nest survival and the amount of
   human settlements in the vicinity of the wood was inversely correlated
   with nest survival, probably due to predators associated with humans;
   (5) other habitat variables, which were apparently individually
   unimportant, were found to have an effect on nesting success, if
   combined in a single `suitability index'. It is impossible to generalize
   about the influence of landscape fragmentation on nest predation because
   local landscape history and predator guilds, together with the scale of
   fragmentation, probably interact to determine the suitability of nest
   sites and their vulnerability to predators.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1967, the Egyptian Goose has established a feral breeding
   population of some 1350 pairs in the Netherlands and colonized large
   pouts of the country. Aspects of the breeding cycle and the changes in
   winter numbers are analysed. The Dutch population has a six-month
   breeding season and overall breeding success in the Netherlands is
   higher than in Africa, or in the British population. The proportion of
   successful pairs and overall breeding success decreased a few years
   after colonization of ne ru areas. Timing of the onset of incubation was
   positively related to winter severity. Density-dependent factors
   appeared to begin to operate soon after colonization. As soon as the
   population stabilized, environmental factors became of major importance.
   Although population size is reduced during severe winters, the delay in
   the onset of breeding and relatively high success after such winters, as
   well as the prolonged breeding season, can quickly compensate for these
   losses. This combination may explain the relatively greater breeding
   output of this tropical species in the moderate climate of Western
   Europe.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Factors affecting success of individual clutches and reproduction in the
   Hoopoe Upupa epops were studied over five years in a colour-ringed
   population in Granada, southern Spain. Pairs initiated between one and
   three breeding attempts per season (including replacement clutches), but
   only 19\% laid a second clutch after raising one successful brood.
   Seasonal productivity ranged from none to eight fledglings. The pairs
   that laid a second clutch obtained slightly greater productivity than
   those that did not, although the differences were not significant, and
   productivity was not correlated with the number of attempts initiated.
   Apparently, the reason that these differences were not greater was the
   higher predation rate suffered by second and replacement clutches.
   Predation accounted for 55\% of nest losses, although two other major
   causes were nest desertion and death of females in the nest (17\% each).
   The modal laying date of first clutches in the population was close to
   the date when the productivity of first clutches was higher. This
   suggests that, for most individuals, the costs of early laying exceed
   the benefits of obtaining two broods due to differences in quality
   between them. Successful clutches produced one to six fledglings (mean
   2.97) and the proportion of eggs per clutch that failed to produce
   fledglings in these successful clutches was very high (49\%). Most
   losses in successful clutches were due to death of chicks, which
   normally died very young and in a sequence determined by the hierarchy
   in the brood due to complete hatching asynchrony. The number of chicks
   fledged was positively correlated with the amount of food carried to the
   nest by parents. The patterns of nestling mortality and food delivery
   suggest that the Hoopoe is a brood reduction strategist that reduces
   `optimistic' clutch sizes by selective starvation of the youngest chicks
   through extreme hatching asynchrony.}},

   studied population, yearly variation in clutch size could be explained
   by yearly variation in the timing of reproduction. Reproductive rates
   were higher than in more northerly populations. A seasonal decrease in
   breeding success of Rollers in Extremadura was caused by a reduction in
   clutch size and the percentage of hatched eggs, and a seasonal increase

Abstract = {{Nest use and interspecific relationships were studied in the Bearded
   Vulture for nest location in the eastern Pyrenees (NE Spain) and their
   influence an breeding success. A total of 40\% (n = 70) of Bearded
   Vulture nests were usurped (expulsions) by other species, the Griffon
   Vulture being the species which occupied most nests (81\%). Our
   observations suggest the active selection of nests by usurping species,
   which for the moment does not seem to influence the breeding success of
   the Bearded Vulture. The frequency of nest changes, the distance between
   nests and the productivities obtained do not differ significantly
   between territories with expulsions (60\%) and those which still have
   all their nests available (40\%). Nevertheless, expulsion may have a
   greater effect on those territories situated at high altitude or with
   few alternatives far resisting the nest. Since the displacement towards
   sectors with a greater human presence, or with locations more exposed to
   unfavourable environmental conditions, may affect breeding success, this
   may be important for the conservation of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of the number of winter social groups of Crested Tits in
   Scotland ranged from 2300 (95\% CL 1300-3900) to 3300 (95\% CL
   2000-5200) during a survey over three winters in ancient native
   pinewoods and other woodlands. These represent a population of 5600-7900
   birds after adjustment for incomplete counts of group sizes. Mean group
   densities were about ten times higher in ancient native pinewoods
   (9.0-10.3 km(-2)) than in other woodlands (0.7-1.3 km(-2)) which
   comprised largely planted Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine and Sitka Spruce.
   Thus, 35\% of the Scottish population of Crested Tits occurred in
   ancient native pinewood, which comprises only 4.7\% of the woodland.
   Crested Tits were associated mainly with Scots Pine, but were also Seen
   in Lodgepole Pine, Norway Spruce, larch, Rowan, Alder and birch. The
   group densities within the stands of Scots Pines in ancient native
   pinewoods were 10.4-12.3 km(-2) and 1.2-2.4 km(-2) in Scots Pines in
   other woodlands. Within ancient native pinewoods, they preferred stands
   with a high proportion of Scots Pines, and particularly those with older
   trees. In other woodlands, there was again a preference for stands with
   a high proportion of Scots Pines, and Heather was also selected. Crested
   Tits will continue to benefit from the planting of Scots Pines, and if
   the woods develop a Heather field layer However, they will not benefit
   from spruce plantations.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the wing-length and body mass of the two populations of Reed
   Warblers (summer breeders and transients), and that of the resident
   Clamorous Reed Warbler which exist in Israel. We found that, in all
   three groups, wing-length increases significantly with age for several
   years. Body mass also increased slightly (but significantly) with age.
   These differences were not caused by differential survival of juveniles,
   but appear to be a general phenomenon, possibly related to better
   nutrition of the adults. The autumn migration of transient Reed Warblers
   lasted from August until November, but no adults were captured during
   October and November while 29.3\% of the first-year birds were captured
   during these months. This suggests that adults can afford to start
   migration earlier, perhaps due to their greater experience.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the male Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix population in Britain
   was undertaken made in 1995 and 1996. The survey was based on counts of
   males displaying in the spring. In Wales and Staffordshire, the entire
   known population was surveyed. In northern England and Scotland, a
   stratified random sample of 5-km squares, representing approximately 8\%
   of the species' range, was surveyed. In survey squares, surveyors
   searched all apparently suitable habitat between late March and early
   May, and counted any displaying males at dawn. Densities on survey
   squares varied from zero to 2.4 displaying males per km(2) of apparently
   suitable habitat. The British population of spring-displaying male Black
   Grouse was estimated as 6510 (95\% confidence limits 5000-8100).
   Regional population estimates are presented. Analysis of the survey
   results and a special validation study highlighted a number of potential
   sources of error, Ways of improving any future surveys, while retaining
   repeatability, are suggested. The national population estimate produced
   by this survey is well below other recent published estimates and
   provides further evidence of a serious decline for the British Black
   Grouse.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the results of an ongoing survey (1975-96) of
   wintering birds in twelve 10 km x 10 km squares around Banbury,
   Oxfordshire. Trends in both abundance and distribution were discernible
   for 48 species of the 93 recorded. These trends mirror those published
   for breeding birds in the UK as a whole. The severe decline of many
   farmland species that has been documented elsewhere is clearly shown
   here, although recently several species in our study are showing
   encouraging increases or stability. This study, carried our by the
   Banbury Ornithological Society, is the only long-term scheme monitoring
   terrestrial wintering birds in the UK. Ils results are particularly
   important because, in winter, the UK may support a significant
   proportion of the European population of some species, and if
   demonstrates the validity of winter census.}},

Abstract = {{The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is one of the most endangered species
   in Europe. The French populations breeding in cultivated areas have
   suffered a drastic decline during the last 20 years and have disappeared
   from several locations. In a political context, where management
   agreements are developed under EU agri-environment regulations, it has
   become urgent to identify the ecological requirements of this species,
   to predict its response to environmental changes and to suggest
   management tools, such as promotion of beneficial farming practices.
   Despite the fact that many studies have described the habitat of the
   Little Bustard, quantitative data are lacking. We measured habitat use
   in relation to availability in a cultivated plain in western France in
   1995. Habitat use by the Little Bustard differed significantly from
   habitat availability. Some crops, such as oilseed rape and cereals, were
   avoided. Sunflower crops were used by Little Bustard males, but were
   avoided by females. Females used set-aside to a greater extent than
   males. Habitat diversity was significantly greater around the centre of
   male activity than in randomly selected areas. These differences were
   found for areas within a radius of 100 and 200 m around centres of male
   activity but not for those with a 300 m radius. Vegetation height was
   one of the most important variables for calling males, as low vegetation
   is needed to detect and be detected by conspecifics. The most important
   variables for females are food resources and, to a lesser extent,
   predator avoidance. For these reasons, recent changes in land use on
   arable plains are likely to have different effects on males and females.
   Conservation measures should take into account these differences, the
   importance of the scale of measurement and should incorporate specific
   ecological requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of breeding Skylarks, in terms of both density and
   presence/absence, was assessed from Breeding Bird,Survey data irt
   relation to habitat in a random sample of about 1500 1-km squares
   throughout the UK in two consecutive years, with particular emphasis on
   the farmland habitat. Upland grassland and other seminatural grassland
   habitats held the highest mean densities of Skylarks. Within farmland,
   arable land held the highest and pasture land the lowest densities, bur
   there was a seasonal decline in arable density. Regression analyses
   showed that Skylark occurrence was most consistently related to the area
   of arable farmland (positive effects) and the area of woodland (negative
   effects). Skylark density increased with increasing habitat diversify in
   upland squares only. Within farmland, boundary characteristics and the
   presence of grazers had the most consistent negative effects. The
   diversity of field types was positively related to Skylark density,
   which gives some support to the hypothesis that a decrease in the
   diversity of field types as a result of simplification of farm rotations
   in recent decades may have led to the decline of the Skylark in the UK,
   but further conclusions about the effects of specific crop types were
   not possible at this scale of analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1980s, Shetland's Kittiwake population totalled 54 000
   pairs in 55 breeding stations of greatly varying size. Since 1985,
   periodic counts of nests have been made at all stations, mostly from an
   inflatable boat and in the same manner as a comprehensive survey in
   1981. Different stations were surveyed in different years and at varying
   intervals. Changes in numbers vs at individual stations varied in size
   and direction. To estimate the total breeding population, and variation
   in the overall rate of change between 1981 and 1997, `missing' nest
   counts at each station were calculated from mean annual rates of change
   between actual counts; the overall estimated population was expressed as
   the annual sum of actual and calculated nest counts. Shetland's
   Kittiwake population declined by 50\% during 1981-97. Although the
   decline tons progressive, the rate increased markedly during 1989-93,
   then decreased between 1993-97. The main causes of fire decline are
   considered to have been successive years of low breeding success, due to
   low availability of sandeels, increased rates of predation of nests by
   Gnat Skuas and increased predation of adults by skuas.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal and nocturnal time-activity budgets were complied for
   White-headed Docks at their most important wintering area, Burdur Lake
   in Turkey, during February and March 1993. During the day, ducks spent
   28\% of the time feeding, 57\% resting 11\% in locomotion, 4\% preening
   and 1\% in alert behaviour.. No courtship behaviour tons observed.
   Resting peaked in the middle of the day. As wave-height increased,
   feeding and swimming increased and resting decreased, Ar night, 92\% of
   time was spent feeding. Sites used by White-headed Ducks held a higher
   biomass of food it ems (benthic chironomid larvae) than other parts of
   the lake. Movement of individuals and marked differences in diurnal time
   budgets occurred between sites, as birds concentrated in flocks for
   resting and dispersed to feed. The proportion of birds resting increased
   with the number of birds present, both within and between sites. Feeding
   tons concentrated at those sites supporting a higher biomass of
   chironomids for a given depth.}},

   ann the detectability of territory-holding individuals were examined.
   The use of registrations of singing birds only was more reliable in
   identifying territories than registrations of all birds. Approximately
   70\% of known territories were detected during the two hours after
   sunrise, with less than 30\% detected during the remainder of the day.
   Census work to determine density should therefore only be undertaken in
   the early morning. The relatively constant but low detection rate
   (10-20\%) later than five hours after sunrise implies that the
   collection of data for calculation of indices of abundance can be made
   at this time.}},

Abstract = {{We studied nestbox selection, habitat quality and reproductive success
   of Eurasian Kestrels Falco tinnunculus during 1985-95 in western
   Finland. Nestboxes were termed small, intermediate or large depending on
   the basal area, and exposed or sheltered depending on their orientation
   to prevailing weather conditions. Egg-laying started earlier in the
   intermediate nestboxes than in small boxes, indicating that intermediate
   nestboxes were selected first by arriving Kestrels. There were no
   differences in clutch size or number of fledglings produced with respect
   to nestbox size or orientation. The occupancy rate did not differ
   markedly between different-sized nestboxes, but it was lower in exposed
   nestboxes than in sheltered ones. We found that occupied nestboxes were
   further from forest edges, roads and inhabited houses, and had more
   grassy ditches (previously identified as good habitat for Microtus
   voles, the main prey of Kestrels) in their vicinity than unoccupied
   boxes. There were no obvious differences in body size and body condition
   of parent Kestrels with respect to nestbox size and habitat qualify.
   These results suggest that both nestbox size and orientation were
   important nest-site selection criteria, but breeding success was largely
   determined by laying date, habitat characteristics around the nest, and
   cyclic food abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers and habitat preferences of breeding Lapwings and of wintering
   Lapwings and Golden Plovers were studied over three years in a largely
   arable district of northeast Essex. There were 49-54 pairs of breeding
   Lapwings over the period 1994-96, using 6-9 sites, with 69-83\% of the
   total in coastal grazing marshes. The majority of the remainder was in
   coastal spring tillage, breeding birds being virtually absent from the
   hinterland. Large numbers of Lapwings and Golden Plovers were recorded
   in the first winter of study but many fewer in subsequent winters.
   Larger fields were used preferentially by both species and boundary
   quality appeared unimportant. Birds fed opportunistically on bare ground
   left from early harvested crops in late summer. Lapwings were found
   mostly on plough and stubble in early autumn, on cereals through the
   winter, with grass becoming important in late winter. Cereals held most
   Golden Plovers, and they showed a greater preference for cereals than
   did Lapwings. There was a large overlap in habitat use between the two
   species. There teas no clear seasonal pattern in feeding. Lapwings
   avoided cereal fields where the blade height was greater than 110 mm,
   whereas the critical height for Golden Plovers was 9 mm. The vapid
   growth of autumn-sown cereals in 1994 and 1995 was considered to be the
   reason for the reduced population of bath species using the region. It
   is considered that, if warm dry autumns become the norm, allowing rapid
   growth of winter cereals, the implications for the long-term
   conservation of Lapwings and Golden Plovers in southern England could be
   severe.}},

   has larger, more convex wings than the sedentary one. Wing morphology
   was accurately correlated with migratory habit when corrected for size

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Male Hoopoes Upupa epops, (Coraciformes) have a very simple song, with a
   repertoire size of one. The number of elements per strophe (strophe
   length) is the only difference between strophes of the same male, and
   the main difference between males. The function of this song was
   analysed in a colour-ringed population of Hoopoes in Granada, southern
   Spain, by monitoring the pattern of male song activity and response to
   an experimental song throughout the breeding season. Both spontaneous
   songs and responses to playback experiments decreased after the onset of
   egg-laying, and song production was not associated with feeding sites or
   nest holes. Moreover, some of the breeding males that had lost their
   females resumed singing, Males also used song to recover lost contacts
   with their mates. These findings suggest that the principal function of
   song in the Hoopoe is intersexual, for attracting females, and that, in
   an intrasexual context, its use is restricted to defence of mates. The
   dual function of Hoopoe song suggests that it provides information both
   for males and females, probably about male quality.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of data are considered. One describes recovery data from
   Lapwings ringed as young in Britain in 1963-92. The other provides
   several weather covariates for the same period, and our objective is to
   try to relate these two data sets. We use score tests, provided by the
   computer package Eagle, to build a simple model which describes the data
   well. We first establish a need for time variation in the three basic
   elements of the model: first-year annual survival probability, adult
   annual survival probability and reporting probability. We then
   investigate the direct incorporation of covariates, using score tests,
   to give a limited set of models to compare. The final choice between
   these models is based on the Akaike information criterion (Alc). We find
   that adult annual survival is negatively related to measures of winter
   weather severity. In contrast to previous work, we have found a
   pronounced decline of reporting rate with time. Our methods produce
   appreciably higher estimates of adult survival than those previously
   obtained using methods which assumed reporting rates to be constant over
   time.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{14-21}},
Abstract = {{We provide background information to allow a heuristic understanding of
   two types of criteria used in selecting a model for making inferences
   from ringing data. The first type of criteria (e.g. AIC, AIC(c), QAIC(c)
   and TIC) are estimates of: (relative) Kullback-Leibler information or
   distance and attempt to select a good approximating model for inference,
   based on the principle of parsimony. The second type of criteria (e.g.
   BIC, MDL, HQ) are `dimension consistent' in that they attempt to
   consistently estimate the dimension of the true model. These latter
   criteria assume that a hue model exists, that if is in the set of
   candidate models and that the goal of model selection is to find the
   true model, which in turn requires that the sample size is very large.
   The Kullback-Leibler based criteria do not assume a true model exists,
   let alone that if is in the set of models being considered. Based on a
   review of these criteria, we recommend use of criteria that are based on
   Kullback-Leibler information in the biological sciences.}},

Title = {{Multi-way comparisons and generalized linear models of nest success:
   extensions of the Mayfield method}},
Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Abstract = {{The Mayfield method of estimating a constant probability of daily nest
   success adjusts for the fact that nests found part-way through a nesting
   stage (egg-laying, incubation or brood-rearing) have, by definition, not
   failed since the stage began. The equality of two independently
   estimated probabilities can be tested using their associated standard
   errors. However, published Mayfield methodology does not extend to
   testing the equality of three or more probabilities, considering
   multi-way comparisons, or fitting complex regression-type models. It is
   important that such flexibility is accessible to biologists. I present
   an overview of the statistical model underlying the Mayfield method and
   of its assumptions, and present a test of goodness-of-fit based on the
   deviance. The model is extended to one-way classifications numbering two
   or more categories. A hypothesis test of the equality of all
   category-specific probabilities is derived based on the likelihood-untie
   statistic. Relevant formulae ave given explicitly to enable calculations
   to be done without computer software. More complex models can befitted
   and compared within the framework of generalized linear modelling,
   noting that logistic regression produces deviances, parameter estimates
   and asymptotic variances that Rue identical to those obtained from
   matching Mayfield models. The estimation and hypothesis-testing
   procedures are illustrated using British Trust for Ornithology Nest
   Record Scheme data for the Corn Bunting and the Song Thrush.}},

Abstract = {{Several papers have demonstrated the advantages of collecting
   capture-recapture data using subsamples (i.e. Pollack's robust design).
   Compared with a standard design (i.e. one sample per period), this
   approach (1) permits the estimation of more demographic parameters and
   (2) in many cases produces more efficient estimators. Program SURVIV is
   a powerful tool for computing parameter estimates under the robust
   design. However multinomial models developed for the robust design
   require cells for each possible capture history that occurs across the
   subsamples within a period. This makes the process of entering cell
   probabilities in SURVIV very tedious and subject to errors. Program
   RDSURVIV combines SURVIV with a front end that converts capture
   histories taken under the robust design to the proper input format for
   estimating parameters under a general model, nlm builds that model. This
   model permits Markovian temporary emigration, trap response in capture
   probabilities and time variation in all parameters. Program RDSURVIV
   also automatically computes estimates under a series of submodels, but
   also permits the user to specify other submodels.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{39-46}},
Abstract = {{A recent trend in the analysis of capture-recapture data, in the broad
   sense, is the development of survival models mixing different types of
   events such as live recapture and dead recoveries. These models are
   similar to those developed for analysing competing events and multistate
   life histories in human health studies, which are frequently based on
   Markov chains. The major difference is that, in the capture-recapture
   context, every event is subject to a defection probability in general
   lower than one. Multistratum capture-recapture models are then a natural
   tool. We show that models for information mixtures easily enter this
   framework, provided adequate, possibly non-observable, strata ave
   defined. Similarities and differences between such models are then easy
   to ascertain and understand. A multistratum model for mixtures of live
   recaptures and dead recoveries is presented and an example of data from
   the literature is treated, using a prototype MATLAB program named
   M-SURGE. Further generalizations and expected developments are
   discussed.}},

   However, the hazard function (the instantaneous rate of change in

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{55-61}},
Abstract = {{The probability of surviving and moving between `states' is of great
   interest to biologists. Robust estimation of these transitions using
   multiple observations of individually identifiable marked individuals
   has received considerable attention in recent years. However, in some
   situations, individuals are not identifiable (or have a very low
   recapture rate), although all individuals in a sample can be assigned to
   a particular state (e.g. breeding or non-breeding) without error. In
   such cases, only aggregate data (number of individuals in a given state
   at each occasion) are available. If the underlying matrix of transition
   probabilities does not vary through time and aggregate data are
   available for several time periods, then it is possible to estimate
   these parameters using least-squares methods. Even when such data ave
   available, this assumption of stationarity will usually be deemed overly
   restrictive and, frequently, data will only be available for two time
   periods. In these cases, the problem reduces to estimating the most
   likely matrix (or matrices) leading to the observed frequency
   distribution of individuals in each state. An entropy maximization
   approach has been previously suggested. In this paper we show that the
   entropy approach rests on a particular limiting assumption, and does not
   provide estimates of latent population parameters (the transition
   probabilities), but rather predictions of realized rates.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an extension of Courmack-Jolly-Seber models to handle a
   complex mark-recapture problem in which (a) the sex of birds cannot be
   determined prior to first moult, but can be predicted on the basis of
   body measurements, and (b) a significant portion of captured birds
   appear to be transients (i.e. are captured once but leave the area or
   otherwise become `untrappable'). We applied this methodology to a data
   set of 4184 serins (Serinus serinus) trapped in northeastern Spain
   during 1985-96, in order to investigate age-, sex-, and time-specific
   variation in survival rates. Using this approach, we were able to
   successfully incorporate the majority of ringings of serins. Had we
   eliminated birds not previously captured (as has been advocated to avoid
   the problem of transience) we would have reduced our sample sizes by
   >2000 releases. In addition, we were able to include 1610 releases of
   birds of unknown (but predicted) sex; these data contributed to the
   precision of our estimates and the power of statistical tests. We
   discuss problems with data structure, encoding of the algorithms to
   compute parameter estimates, model selection, identifiability of
   parameters, and goodness-of-fit, and make recommendations for the design
   and analysis of future studies facing similar problems.}},

Pages = {{74-81}},
Abstract = {{Although the recruitment of breeders is as important to population
   dynamics as mortality, it has received far less attention from
   statisticians working at modelling capture histories of marked animals.
   However, two main approaches to studying local recruitment have become
   available in the last three years. Both deal with birds marked as chicks
   and then possibly resighted or recaptured only as breeders (the same
   approaches may be applied more generally whenever breeders and
   non-breeders can be distinguished in a population by working with the
   sole observations 4 breeding animals). This situation is natural to
   species of colonial birds sampled on the breeding site where the young
   remain away From the breeding site previous to their first breeding
   attempt. The first method published (Clobert el al., 1994) contrasts, in
   the context of a survival analysis, the capture rates of known breeders
   and the capture rates of animals tip to their first observed breeding
   attempt. Young animals as a group are less likely to be `captured' if
   some have not yet started to reproduce. It is then possible to estimate
   age-specific breeding probabilities, i.e. the proportions of breeding
   animals in each age-class. The second approach (Pradel, 1996, Pradel et
   al., 1997) addresses recruitment directly. Capture histories are read
   backwards starting from the last observed breeding event and asking the
   question: when in the past did an animal start breeding? In this way,
   one can estimate the probability that a breeding animal is a first-time
   breeder as a function of age, individual characteristics or
   environmental conditions. A third approach based on the history of
   individual animals is presented here for the first time. It involves
   estimating the probability that an as yet inexperienced animal starts to
   breed and can be implemented as a particular case of a two-state model
   with a non-observable state (Lebreton et al., 1999, this volume). Under
   general assumptions, there are simple relationships between the
   different parameters that measure accession to reproduction but not all
   seem equally flexible nor relevant to the same questions.}},

Abstract = {{The size of the breeding population of Brandt's Cormorants Phalacrocorax
   penicillatus on Southeast Farallon Island, off the coast of central
   California, LISA, shows large annual fluctuations and has declined by
   50\% since the 1970s. We investigated patterns of variation in adult
   survival, breeding probability, resighting probability, juvenile
   survival and reproductive success, to determine the extent to which
   variation in demographic processes reflected variation in environmental
   conditions (e.g. food availability) versus density-dependence, using
   observations of breeders and non-breeders from 1976 to 1995. Resighting
   and breeding probabilities varied significantly among years, and both
   were positively correlated with an annual index of prey availability the
   abundance of juvenile rockfish. Adult survival between years was
   significantly correlated with changes in juvenile rockfish abundance and
   differed between sexes (0.77, males; 0.71, females). Female, but not
   male, survival appeared age-specific: older females showed reduced
   survival, especially during El Nino years. Intermittent breeding
   appeared common in this population: 54\% of males and 49\% of females
   estimated to be alive in a given year were not observed breeding in that
   year. Reproductive success varied in relation to the juvenile rockfish
   index but not in relation to population size. The return rate of
   juveniles, an inner of survival during the first three years of life,
   was negatively related to sea surface temperature, both in the year of
   hatching and in the third year of life, when individuals first return to
   the colony to breed. We conclude that this population is strongly
   susceptible to environmental fluctuation. All parameters of survival and
   reproduction deteriorate under poor environmental conditions, with no
   evidence of buffering, and there was no evidence of density-dependence.
   Thus extrinsic, not intrinsic, forces appear most important in
   explaining recent population fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for studying post-fledging survival rates from data
   on national ringing recoveries. The approach extends the classical
   two-age-class models of Brownie et al. (1985) to include a third
   age-class of birds ringed as nestlings. The models can incorporate
   age-class-specific and year-specific variation in reporting rates and
   survival rates. Unlike intensive resighting studies at single sites,
   this approach does not confound death with emigration and provides
   estimates of survival which are representative of a larger geographical
   area. We implemented the models with SURVIV software, using
   likelihood-ratio tests to assess the significance of possible age and
   year effects art survival rates or reporting rates. We demonstrate this
   approach using a set of data an British-ringed Song Thrushes Turdus
   philomelos. In this case, we were unable to detect any
   age-class-specific or year-specific variation in reporting rates and,
   although the survival rates of first-year and adult Song Thrushes varied
   significantly between years, post-fledgling survival did not show any
   detectable inter-annual variation. Song Thrushes ringed as nestlings had
   a 0.38 chance (95\% CI = 0.30-0.45) of surviving the 63-day
   post-fledging period (here defined as the period separating the average
   dates of birds ringed as nestlings and birds ringed as independent
   first-year birds).}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{112-119}},
Abstract = {{`At what age to start breeding?' is a question fundamental to analysis
   of life histories. While there has been considerable interest in the
   theoretical aspects of age of first breeding, comparatively little work
   has been done on the problems of estimating recruitment rates in wild
   populations. Most studies to date have relied on ad hoc methods that
   rely on one or more assumptions which may be generally untenable.
   Recently, it has been suggested that mark-recapture analysis can provide
   a robust, statistically formal approach for the analysis of recruitment,
   by using `reverse capture-histories' to estimate the probability of
   entering the population over a given interval. We applied this approach
   to data from the arctic-breeding Lesser Snow, Goose Anser c.
   caerulescens, using data from a long-term study in subarctic Canada. We
   tested the hypothesis that recruitment rate in this species tons
   influenced by structural size. Since arctic-nesting geese rely heavily
   on endogenous nutrient reserves for reproduction, structurally smaller
   birds may be less able to recruit at a young age than larger birds.
   However, despite significant long-term changes in body size, and
   significant annual variation in recruitment rate, we found no evidence
   of correspondence between the two.}},

Abstract = {{MARK provides parameter estimates from marked animals when they are
   re-encountered at a later time as dead recoveries, or live recaptures or
   re-sightings. The time intervals between re-encounters do not have to be
   equal. More than one attribute group of animals can be modelled, The
   basic input to MARK is the encounter history for each animal. MARK can
   also estimate the size of closed populations. Parameters can be
   constrained to be the same across re-encounter occasions, or by age, or
   group, using the parameter index matrix. A set of common models for
   initial screening of data are provided. Time effects, group effects,
   time x group effects and a null model of none of the above, are provided
   for each parameter Besides the logit function to link the design matrix
   to the parameters of the model, other link functions include the
   log-log, complimentary log-log, sine, fog, and identity The estimates of
   model parameters are computed via numerical maximum likelihood
   techniques. The number of parameters that are estimable in the model are
   determined numerically and used to compute the quasi-likelihood Ale
   value for the model. Both the input data, and outputs for various models
   that the user has built, are staved in the Results database which
   contains a complete description of the model building process. It is
   viewed and manipulated in a Results Browser window. Summaries available
   from this window include viewing and printing model output, deviance
   residuals from the model, likelihood ratio and analysis of deviance
   between models, and adjustments for over dispersion. Models can also be
   retrieved and modified to create additional models. These capabilities
   are implemented in a Microsoft Windows 95 interface. The online help
   system has been developed to provide all necessary program
   documentation.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic stochasticity comes from the fact that individuals go
   through life cycle transitions in a random manner; if is therefore
   inherent in any demographic process, regardless of the environment.
   Under demographic uncertainty, populations can always become extinct and
   the probability of extinction depends on population size and structure.
   For small populations this uncertainty, can be an important cause of
   extinction. From a typical passerine rife cycle graph, a practical study
   is conducted using the ULM computer program. A two-sex model with mating
   system is built and extinction probabilities ave computed via Monte
   Carlo simulation. It is Found that demographic stochasticity imposes
   high extinction probabilities on short-lived bird species and that the
   mating system is a major determinant of the survival of small
   populations.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{148-156}},
Abstract = {{The great flexibility of capture-recapture models to estimate survival
   and recruitment parameters is described. Recruitment models appear as
   analogous to survival models applied to capture histories reversed in
   time. The available flexibility is used at its best by basing model
   selection on the minimization of Akaike's information criterion within a
   set of biologically plausible models. However, to proceed to model
   selection, one needs to determine the number of identifiable parameters.
   We explain how SURGE version 5.0 (available on the Internet by anonymous
   ftp from ftp.cefe.cnrs-mop.fr) makes it possible to fit survival and
   recruitment models and determines numerically how many and which
   parameters are concerned with identifiability problems. Model selection
   for survival and recruitment models is illustrated using European Dipper
   Cinclus cinclus data. The advantages and shortcomings are discussed.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Intensive ringing of the large Sand Martin Riparia riparia population of
   Eastern Hungary has been carried out at breeding colonies since 1986.
   Previous survival modelling has shown a close relationship between the
   adult survival rates and Sahelian weather conditions. The detection of
   such environmental effects on juvenile survival is more complicated
   because mortality is confounded with dispersal, which varies with age
   and sex. Although juveniles cannot be sexed by morphological characters,
   this study examines models of the survival and recapture rates of birds
   ringed as juvenile males and females separately by assuming a 1:1 sex
   ratio among juveniles at ringing. Using this approach it was possible to
   identify biologically realistic models which described the data, but
   different models were selected for each sex. To study variation in the
   survival rates of birds ringed as juveniles, if is thus important to
   model survival and recapture rates for each sex separately. The methods
   presented here require further development. It teas not possible to
   produce unambiguous evidence of real differences in the survival rates
   of one-year-old and older birds because age- and sex-related differences
   in dispersal could affect the results.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate potential biases in productivity indices and
   survival-rate estimates from four years(1992-95) of data from the
   Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Programme, we
   examined correlations and regressions of trends in adult captures on
   population changes modelled from productivity indices and survival-rate
   estimates for target species at both local and regional scales. We
   estimated trends in adult captures from regressions of drain indices on
   year. We calculated mean numbers of young per adult, and estimated
   time-constant, annual adult survival rates from mark-recapture data
   using both non-transient and transient models. We used these
   productivity indices and survival-rate estimates in a simple demographic
   model to calculate predicted rates of population change. We modelled
   survival of young birds (phi(y); from initial capture, generally during
   juvenile dispersal, to recruitment into the following year's breeding
   population) relative to adults (phi(a)) as phi(y) = 0.75 x phi(a). At
   the local scale, correlation coefficients between trends in adult
   captures and modelled population changes tended to be positive, but the
   strengths of the correlations were often weak. As expected, trends in
   adult captures generally were better correlated with modelled population
   changes than with either productivity or survival. Stronger correlations
   between trends in adult captures and modelled population changes tended
   to be found using survival estimates from the non-transient model, but
   modelled population changes using the transient model gave values for
   mean population changes closest to those derived from trends in adult
   captures. Modelled population changes sometimes were less well
   correlated with trends in adult captures at the regional than at the
   local scale, presumably because of spatial heterogeneity in the factors
   affecting population dynamics of target species. These results suggest
   that absolute measures of productivity derived from MAPS are likely to
   be biased, but do not show unequivocally the extent to which such biases
   might differ between species. Nevertheless, given the relatively low
   precision of analyses based an only a few years of data, these results
   suggest that relative measures of productivity and survival derived from
   MAPS do reflect observed population changes. Longer runs of data should
   allow the demographic mechanisms causing population changes to be
   investigated.}},

   rates of British and Irish Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo}},
Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{189-197}},
Abstract = {{Ring recovery data were used to assess changes in the survival rates of
   Cormorants in Britain and Ireland between 1965 and 1994. It was found
   that 99\% were ringed as nestlings, thus necessitating an assumption of
   constant reporting rate across age-classes. The wide geographical spread
   of ringing effort since 1965 produced sufficient recoveries to enable
   analyses of trends in survival and reporting rates, but regional
   subdivisions of the data resulted in high sampling correlations between
   survival estimates. The assumption of a constant reporting rate across
   age-classes may be violated for British and Irish Cormorants, because
   first-year birds are more likely to be shot or caught in fishing nets
   than older birds and they have a differing seasonal pattern of
   recoveries. A simple simulation showed that first-year, but not adult,
   survival estimates were particularly sensitive to age-specific variation
   in reporting rates. However, the observed trend in first-year survival
   appeared robust to the assumption of constant reporting rates across
   age-classes. Declining reporting rates in Britain and Ireland imply that
   larger numbers of Cormorants will need to be ringed in order to monitor
   future changes in survival. Regional colour marking schemes for
   Cormorants have the potential to provide high quality survival
   information, to supplement that provided by dean recoveries and to
   offset the observed decline in reporting rates.}},

Title = {{Monitoring survival rates of Swainson's Thrush Catharus ustulatus at
   multiple spatial scales}},
Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{S}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Abstract = {{We estimated survival rates of Swainson's Thrush, a common neotropical,
   migratory landbird, at multiple spatial scales, using data collected in
   the western LISA from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship
   Programme. We evaluated statistical power to detect spatially
   heterogeneous survival rates and exponentially declining survival rates
   among spatial scales with simulated populations parameterized from
   results of the Swainson's Thrush analyses. Models describing survival
   rates as constant across large spatial scales did not fit the data. The
   model toe chose as most appropriate to describe survival rates of
   Swainson's Thrush allowed survival rates to vary among Physiographic
   Provinces, included a separate parameter for the probability that a
   newly captured bird is a resident individual in the study population,
   and constrained capture probability to be constant across all stations.
   Estimated annual survival rates under this model varied from 0.42 to
   0.75 among Provinces. The coefficient of variation of survival estimates
   ranged fi om 5.8 to 20\% among Physiographic Provinces. Statistical
   power to detect exponentially declining trends was fairly low for small
   spatial scales, although large annual declines (3\% of previous year's
   rate) were likely to be detected when monitoring was conducted for long
   periods of time (e.g. 20 years). Although our simulations and field
   results are based an only four years of data from a limited number and
   distribution of stations, it is likely that they illustrate genuine
   difficulties inherent to broadscale efforts to monitor survival rates of
   territorial landbirds. In particular our results suggest that more
   attention needs to be paid to sampling schemes of monitoring programmes,
   particularly regarding the trade-off between precision and potential
   bias of parameter estimates at varying spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{COMDYN is a set of programs developed for estimation of parameters
   associated with community dynamics using count data from two locations
   or time periods. It is Internet-based, allowing remote users either to
   input their own data, or to use data from the North American Breeding
   Bird Survey for analysis. COMDYN allows probability of detection to vary
   among species and among locations and time periods. The basic estimator
   for species richness underlying all estimators is the jackknife
   estimator proposed by Burnham and Overton. Estimators ave presented for
   quantities associated with temporal change in species richness,
   including rate of change in species richness over time, local extinction
   probability, local species turnover and number of local colonizing
   species. Estimators are also presented for quantities associated with
   spatial variation in species richness, including relative richness at
   two locations and proportion of species present in one location that are
   also present at a second location. Application of the estimators to
   species richness estimation has been previously described and justified.
   The potential applications of these programs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Survival and between-year movements of Corncrakes ringed as chicks and
   adult males were investigated in Scotland and Ireland. The probability
   of movement to sites at various distances from the ringing place was
   described by a modified random walk mode. Most males returned to within
   a few kilometres of where they were ringed but there were indications
   that birds ringed as chicks dispersed further than adults. The dispersal
   model was combined with census data to estimate the probability of
   subsequent capture for each ringed individual and mean annual survival
   probabilities. First-year survival was estimated at 0.236, but with a
   wide confidence interval. Adult survival was estimated more precisely at
   0.186. Independent data from studies of breeding success and population
   trends, taken with the estimated adult survival from recaptures,
   indicated a higher first-year survival rate (0.339), but the confidence
   intervals of the two estimates overlapped. Because adult survival was
   low, the rate of population growth was estimated to be very sensitive to
   changes in productivity (chicks reared to independence per female). As a
   result, conservation measures which reduce losses of eggs and chicks
   during mowing, although they lead to modest increases in productivity,
   were estimated to be sufficient to reverse the long-term decline of the
   Corncrake population in Britain. Recent changes in population trend
   after the implementation of these measures are consistent with this
   expectation.}},

Title = {{Modelling survival rates in the Cape Griffon Gyps coprotheres, with
   emphasis on the effects of supplementary feeding}},
Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{230-238}},
Abstract = {{Survival rates are crucial demographic parameters for modelling the
   population dynamics of the Cape Griffon vulture. Previous survival
   estimates based on ring recoveries are seriously flawed and have been
   heavily criticized. To provide better estimates, 97 nestlings were
   individually colour-ringed in the winter-rainfall region of South Africa
   from 1979 to 1987 and an intensive resighting campaign was mounted for
   17.5 years (1980 to mid-1997). Although survival rate is known to vary
   with age, particularly in the first few years of life, this study
   indicates that it is also a function of calendar year. Supplementary
   food was provided for the study population from 1984 onwards and there
   was a concomitant increase in the survival rate of first-year birds.
   Eighty generalized linear models were built to estimate survival rate as
   a function of age, calendar year, cohort and supplementary feeding.
   First-year survival rate was estimated as 42.3\% per annum (95\%<\^{}>
   limits: 29-56\%), increasing to 68.9\% (54-81\%) after the introduction
   of supplementary feeding. Age-specific survival rates were 88.8\% per
   annum (77-95\%) in the second year, 78.7\% (64-88\%) in the third year
   and 67.6\% (58-76\%) for birds aged four years or more. Our survival
   estimated are higher than previous values and have greater reliability
   because they are based on direct observations of known-age birds. The
   loss of colour-rings is a serious impediment to estimating survival
   among older birds and the technique described here was not used to
   estimate adult survival.}},

Abstract = {{Avian cholera, caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, is one of
   the most important diseases affecting waterfowl in North America but
   little is known about the epizootiology of this disease or its impacts
   on annual survival rates. We ringed Lesser Snow Geese Anser caerulescens
   nesting at Wrangel Island, Russia and Banks Island, Canada with metal
   rings and individually coded plastic neck-collars or radio-transmitters
   to determine survival, movement and cause of death. We vaccinated half
   of the neck-collared and radiotagged geese to provide protection from
   avian cholera for up to one year following ringing and thus
   experimentally determine the impacts of this disease on survival. We
   found that vaccination did not reduce short-term survival of the
   experimental birds, compared with control geese. Neck-collared geese
   vaccinated in 1993 at Wrangel Island had higher survival during winter
   1993-94 than control birds. In contrast, we found similar survival
   during winter 1994-95 between vaccinated and control geese neck-collared
   in 1994 at Wrangel and Banks Islands. Survival of radiotagged geese on
   wintering areas during 1994-95 was consistent with the vaccination
   versus control results for neck-collared geese during the same winter.
   However, we found that radiotagged geese that were vaccinated had better
   survival than control geese during winter 1995-96. We believe that
   harvest and avian cholera are the two principal causes of mortality for
   Lesser Snow Geese wintering in the Pacific Flyway and that avian cholera
   may be one of the factors affecting these populations.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{248-252}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneous capture probabilities are a common problem in many
   capture-recapture studies. Several methods of detecting the presence of
   such heterogeneity are currently available, and stratification of data
   has been suggested as the standard method to avoid its effects. However,
   few studies have tried to identify sources of heterogeneity, or whether
   there are interactions among sources. The aim of this paper is to
   suggest an analytical procedure to identify sources of capture
   heterogeneity. We use data on the sex and age of Great Tits captured in
   baited funnel traps, at two localities differing in average temperature.
   We additionally use `recapture' data obtained by videotaping at a feeder
   (with no associated trap), where the tits ringed with different colours
   were recorded. This allowed us to test whether individuals in different
   classes (age, sex and condition) are not trapped because of trap shyness
   or because of a reduced use of the bait. We used logistic regression
   analysis of the capture probabilities to test for the effects of age,
   sec, condition, location and `recapture' method. The results showed a
   higher recapture probability in the colder locality. Yearling birds
   (either males or females) had the highest recapture probabilities,
   followed by adult males, while adult females had the lowest recapture
   probabilities. There was no effect of the method of `recapture' (trap or
   videotape), which suggests that adult females are less often captured in
   traps not because of trap-shyness but because of less dependence on
   supplementary food. The potential use of this methodological approach in
   other studies is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The first large-scale, co-operative, studies of marked birds in North
   America were attempted in the 1950s. Operation Recovery, which linked
   numerous ringing stations along the east coast in a study of autumn
   migration of passerines, and the Preseason Duck Ringing Programme in
   prairie states and provinces, conclusively demonstrated the feasibility
   of large-scale projects. The subsequent development of powerful
   analytical models and computing capabilities expanded the quantitative
   potential for further large-scale projects. Monitoring Avian
   Productivity and Survivorship, and Adaptive Harvest Management are
   current examples of truly large-scale programmes. Their exemplary
   success and the availability of versatile analytical fools are driving
   changes in the North American bird ringing programme. Both the US and
   Canadian ringing offices are modifying operations to collect more and
   better data to facilitate large-scale studies and promote a more
   project-oriented ringing programme. New large-scale programmes such as
   the Cornell Nest Box Network are on the horizon.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for diagnosing causes of bird population declines are described,
   paying special attention to methods that rely on comparisons among
   geographical regions and/or time periods with different population
   trends. Comparisons of breeding productivity and survival among regions
   or periods provide a valuable check on the diagnosis of external causes
   of a decline indicated by correlation with population trend. Ringing or
   tagging programmes can give information on population levels and are the
   main source of information on survival. Age ratios from counts or
   catches of juveniles and adults in standardized frapping programmes can
   provide data on breeding productivity. Nest recording schemes yield
   estimates of productivity if females make one breeding attempt per year
   or if the number of attempts per female can be estimated from
   supplementary data. Population models should be used to explore
   hypotheses about the external causes and demographic mechanisms of
   population declines. Models are described which have combinations of
   parameter values set to give rates of population decline similar to
   those seen in various passerines in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s.
   These models indicate that demographic changes associated with declines
   ave subtle and difficult to detect if the demographic rate which changes
   is density-dependent. Analytical procedures should be devised to compare
   the fit of models with different underlying demographic mechanisms for
   the decline to data on survival and breeding success recorded before,
   during and after declines.}},

Abstract = {{This study categorizes and reviews methods used to estimate stopover
   length in migratory birds. Stopover length is an important variable in
   analysing migration strategies. The analysis of the stopover pattern of
   migratory birds typically attempts to investigate variability in the
   number of stopovers and in the length of time spent at stopover sites in
   relation to species, age, sex and body condition. Although the number of
   capture-recapture studies analysing stopover length has increased
   substantially, most are analysed using the simple last-first capture
   method which gives biased estimates. The use of mathematical models to
   calculate stopover length is uncommon. Most researchers assume
   homogeneity in stopover length and do not determine the capture
   probability. Intensive studies are available for many migratory
   passerines, waders and geese. Some of the data sets are highly
   standardized and could be reanalysed with new applications and
   innovative uses of existing techniques, such as the CJS models.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the abundance of 28 species of common passerines in scrub and
   wetland habitats were assessed from changes in annual catch sizes on
   Constant Effort sites between 1983 and 1995. At sites where annual
   catching effort fell below the required level, annual catch sizes were
   inflated according to experience during years with complete coverage.
   Changes in abundance were assessed through application of log-linear
   Poisson regression models, which allow tests for temporal trends in
   abundance and for differences in trends in abundance between habitat
   types. For most species, long-term changes in adult catches were similar
   to changes in territory counts on Common Birds Census plots, suggesting
   that standardized mist-netting is a reliable method for assessing
   extensive changes in songbird populations. Changes in catch sizes tended
   to be more positive and less negative in wetter habitats than in drier
   habitats. Catches of most insectivorous resident species either
   increased or remained stable, while catches of resident thrushes, small
   finches, buntings and same trans-Saharan migrants declined. The largest
   increases in catches of adult birds were recorded for Robin, Wren,
   GreenFinch, Long-tailed Tit and Chaffinch, while the largest decreases
   in adult catches were recorded for Linnet, Redpoll, spotted Flycatcher,
   Yellowhammer, Reed Bunting and Willow Warbler Relatively large declines
   in the catches of young Greenfinches and Goldfinches may reflect
   declining productivity. Possible environmental causes of these changes
   in abundance are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To identify the environmental changes responsible for population trends,
   it is useful first to determine the demographic mechanisms through which
   they have acted. We present new analyses of survival rates, using
   British ring-recovery data from 1962 to 1995, for 31 farmland passerine
   species. Separate estimates gf the survival rates of adults and
   first-years and, where possible, males and females, are calculated
   specific to periods of increase, stability and decline identified
   objectively from each species' Common Birds Census (CBC) index trend.
   The differences between these estimates are assessed for statistical
   significance by comparing models allowing age-, sex- and trend-specific
   variation with models constraining these parameters. The variations in
   survival with respect to CBC trend direction show whether effects on
   survival have occurred which are consistent with their being an
   important mechanism mediating the effects of the environment on
   abundance. Adults generally had significantly higher survival rates than
   first-years and there was a common trend for male survival to be higher
   than that of females, although sex-specific variation was not
   significant for most species. Variations in survival appear to have
   contributed to the interactions between environmental change and
   abundance for at least 13 of the species studied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the findings of a large number of people engaged
   in the study of the Merlin Falco columbarius population in the south
   Pennines. Between 1980 and 1992 the number of nesting areas found to be
   occupied by Merlin increased from two to 66, and the proportion of
   checked sites found to be occupied rose from 29 to 78\%. The apparent
   increase in the size of the population was not solely a result of
   increased observer activity. The fao occupied nests found in 1980 and
   1981 were in trees in grassland areas, but thereafter nearly all were on
   the ground amongst heather. Compared to the study area as a whole, grass
   moor was less frequent and heather moor more frequent within a 1.5 km
   radius of the nesting area. Nearest-neighbour distance varied from 5.7
   km in 1985 to 2.1 km in 1992, remaining relatively stable in comparison
   to the increasing size of the population. Nesting areas were aggregated
   in comparison to a distribution of random points. The density of nesting
   areas was greatest between 0.25 and 1.5 km from the moorland edge. This
   paper demonstrates that collaboration between conservation professionals
   and dedicated volunteers can succeed in monitoring population change.}},

Abstract = {{The factors affecting the probability of nest site attendance and
   response to playback were examined on Mousa, Shetland, during 1996 with
   the aim of developing a standard method of censusing Storm Petrels using
   diurnal playback. Nest site attendance by breeding birds peaked at 90\%
   during July. Site attendance by non-breeding birds was much lower at
   15\% and this increased as the season progressed. Studies of breeding
   phenology at colonies throughout Britain and Ireland demonstrated that
   the average laying dates at most colonies were in late June, but those
   at Mousa were on average two weeks earlier and at Inish Glora one week
   later. This analysis also suggested that site attendance is highest in
   mid-July and so this represents the best time of year to conduct
   playback censuses at colonies in Britain and Ireland. Rates of response
   to playback of the male purr call were highly variable, with evidence
   for effects of the environment, colony location, playback equipment and
   year. This suggests that the application of a single correction factor
   to playback survey data collected at different colonies is likely to
   result in serious errors in estimation of population status. We
   recommend that the probability of detecting a nest is examined during
   each survey so that a colony-specific correction factor can be applied
   to the census data.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the stopover patterns of male and female Curlew
   Sandpipers at a stopover area in northeast Spain. Curlew Sandpipers were
   trapped and colour-ringed during autumn migration in 1992 and 1993.
   Stopover length was similar to those reported previously for this and
   other waders that migrate using a small number of widely separated
   staging areas, but were greater than stopovers reported for other
   tenders that migrate using it large number of staging areas separated by
   short distances. The differences in stopover length between the birds
   using these two strategies could be related to the fuel reserves that
   have to be accumulated to reach the next staging area. Males stayed
   longer in the area than females. Seasonal changes in prey availability
   or sex differences in moulting and migratory patterns do Mot account far
   these differences in stopover ecology. Following a time-selected model
   of optimal migration, sex differences in stopover ecology could be
   related to a dominance of the larger females over the males or to a
   higher foraging efficiency or a shorter search and settling time in
   females. Whether these differences are restricted to the studied area or
   are widespread in other staging areas used by the species could be
   important for assessing the possible differences in the migration speed
   of Curlew Sandpipers. The finding that males leave the breeding grounds
   21-35 days before females but arrive at the study area with only a
   10-day difference supports the hypothesis that females migrate faster
   than males at least in the first half of their migration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes, for the first time, aspects of the breeding
   biology of the British Golden Oriole population. The Golden Oriole
   population in the fenland basin of East Anglia became established in
   1967 and since the early 1980s the annual breeding population has varied
   from about 20 to 35 pairs. Males arrived in mid-Mac, and females about a
   week later Nest building starts about five days after female arrival.
   Mean date for first egg laying was around I June. The mean clutch size
   was 3.53. Observed incubation periods were 18 to 19 days. Mean hatching
   date was 18 June, and the mean brood size at seven days was 2.60.
   Nestling periods were from 13 to 15 days, and the mean fledging date was
   3 July. Failed clutches may be replaced; no evidence was found for
   genuine second broods. Estimated mean productivity of all nests
   including failures was 1.4-2.0 fledgings per nest. The greatest cause of
   failure was bad weather in June, and nests produced three times as many
   fledged young in warm dry Junes as in cool wet ones. The breeding
   habitat is very strongly associated with plantations of early leafing
   hybrid Black Poplars Populus nigra. A total of 94.2\% of all nests found
   were in these trees, and since 1987 this figure has risen to 100\%. The
   mean height of the nests in poplars was about 7 m below the top of the
   tree, irrespective of the height of the tree. Most nests were in the
   north, northeast or east sectors of the tree, and 80\% were within two
   trees of the edge of the woodland. Breeding densities were generally at
   or below 0.25 pairs/km(2), but up to 2.25 pairs/km(2). Nestling diet
   contains many Poplar-feeding Lepidoptera and a surprising number of
   Bumblebees. Conservation efforts should aim to produce more areas of
   Poplar woodland with plenty of woodland edges and with 30 ha/km(2) of
   Poplar plantation.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of reedbeds and their associated avifauna requires
   intervention management to modify natural succession by means of, for
   example, reed cutting. Nest site density of Greylag Geese Anser anser in
   relation to time since reedbeds were last harvested was studied at
   Vejlerne nature reserve, Denmark (57 degrees 00-07'N, 8 degrees 50'-9
   degrees 10'E). Low nest densities were found in areas in the first four
   years after cutting followed by high densities in areas unharvested for
   five or six years. Subsequently, nest density remained high for four to
   seven years (depending on site) before declining to low levels again.
   Areas cut in the year of study and areas cut more than 16 years before
   contained virtually no nests. The increase in nest density with time
   since last harvest seemed to be related to an increase in vegetation
   cover (reed stem density). Areas harvested more than 16 years before
   probably became too dense for the geese, and newly harvested areas had
   too low a shoot density, hence their low nest density. However, move
   detailed studies are needed to establish causal relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of departure of many migratory passerines breeding in
   southeastern Europe or the Mediterranean remains relatively little
   known. In this work, Reed and Great Reed Warbler mist-netting data from
   a breeding site in Greece are analysed to determine the change in
   catching rate and the timing of premigratory fattening, both of which
   are indicators of departure movements. In both species, departure seemed
   to occur at the same time or earlier than further north in Europe.
   Adults of both species left the study site earlier than juveniles and
   Great Reed Warblers slightly earlier than Reed Warblers. This differs
   greatly from recent findings in the western Mediterranean. One reason
   for this early departure is the possible early depletion of food caused
   by the summer drought. Starting as they do from the northern coast of
   the Mediterranean, birds departing from the study site would be far more
   advanced in their southward movement than conspecifics leaving from
   central or northern European breeding grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of sex, age and nestling history (viz, brood size,
   hatching date and nestling condition) on the progress of post-juvenile
   body moult in the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus was investigated. The stage
   of body moult advanced with increasing age in both sexes, but was
   independent of hatching date, experimental brood size and nestling
   condition. The estimated age at the onset of post-juvenile moult was
   23-46 days and the average estimated age at moult completion was 113
   days. After controlling for age differences, females were on average
   more advanced in moult than males, although the magnitude of this sex
   effect differed in different study years. The results suggest that in

   determinants of the progress of the post-juvenile moult than nestling

Abstract = {{Arrival dates of Swallows from 20 carefully chosen years of the
   phenological reports of the Royal Meteorological Society (1883-1947)
   were abstracted. These years represent observations from 1000 different
   localities in Britain and from between 24 and 325 localities per year.
   Arrival dates of the Swallow were processed in two different ways: (II
   using a Geographical Information System, contour maps were produced for
   each year and compared subjectively; (2) using climatic data from
   Britain and Europe, between-year variation in average arrival date and
   in speed of progression through Britain were analysed statistically.
   Swallows progressed through Britain at an average speed of about 50 km
   day(-1). In `early' arrival years, Swallows progressed along a
   southwest-northeast axis, entering Britain by the southwest (the region
   receiving the most accumulated heat by April). They travelled faster
   across Britain in `late' arrival years along a south-north axis. Arrival
   dates were earlier during warmer Aprils in Britain and western France,
   and following a warmer March in Iberia. Although the timing of spring
   migration of the Swallow is related to European temperatures, the
   possible future effects of climatic changes may not be predictable
   because environmental conditions in Africa and changes in population
   size must also be taken into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being a relatively recent development, the mapping of bird
   distributions using grid-based atlases has become one of the most
   frequent forms of ornithological survey. The data generated by
   ornithological atlases have a number of potential uses which are
   reviewed in this paper under the following categories: (1) education and
   recreation, (2) documenting distribution and population for conservation
   purposes, (3) documenting changes in population and range, (4) providing
   a framework for survey design, (5) assessing bird-environment
   associations, (6) generating hypotheses about causes of range change and
   (7) investigating theoretical aspects of ecology. The strengths and
   weaknesses of atlas data are considered in each case. We conclude that,
   despite a number of statistical and methodological problems which need
   to be addressed, atlases have become an indispensable tool for assessing
   large-scale patterns of bird distribution and distributional change and
   for answering a wide range of questions relating to them. They have many
   applications in ecology and conservation and should be regarded as an
   essential complement to annual population monitoring schemes and
   fine-scale studies of bird-habitat relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The status and distribution of Common Scoters Melanitta nigra nigra in
   Britain and Ireland were determined from a survey ill April-lune 1995.
   Three visits were made to all known, and a sample of potential, breeding
   sires. A total of 439 birds runs located, from which the British and
   Irish population was estimated at 195 pairs (100 in Ireland, 95 in
   Britain). In Ireland, three sites held 100 pairs or 51\% of the
   population. In Britain, birds were spread over 61 sites in 23 10-km
   squares, all in Scotland. Breeding Common Scoters are somewhat more
   abundant in Britain and Ireland than hitherto thought. However, this is
   due mainly to comprehensive survey coverage in 1995 and, over the past
   30 years, Common Scoters have actually suffered both population decline
   and range contraction. The Irish population declined from 180 to 100
   pairs between 1967 and 1981, but has since remained stable. In Britain,
   Common Scoters have ceased to breed on Shetland, in Central Scotland,
   and in Dumfries \& Galloway. Historical data are lacking, brit ill the
   Flow Country numbers have declined from some 50 pairs in 1988 to 35
   pairs in 1995. All birds in Ireland, but only half of those in Britain
   were on protected sites. Given the Common Scoter's threatened status in
   BI Britain and Ireland and since the population dynamics of the species
   are largely unknown, annual monitoring of numbers and productivity is
   required to determine population trends and establish natural limits of
   population fluctuation. AS Common Scoters in Britain and Ireland are
   threatened both by factors operating over whole water catchments
   (deteriorating water quality resulting from eutrophication and
   afforestation) and at individual sites (competition with introduced
   Roach, predation by American Mink), integrated catchment management
   plans, including site safeguard measures, seem necessary for the
   effective conservation of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Curlew Numenius arquata and
   Redshank Tringa tetanus reacted in a variety of ways to human
   disturbance. They delayed arrival and departed earlier when disturbed.
   Vigilance (scan rates) increased with the vigour of human activity and
   the birds were more vigilant in the higher shove zones, but there tons
   no corresponding decrease in food searching (peck rates). Prey capture
   rates of Oystercatcher and Curlew apparently increased with moderately
   close human disturbance. Undisturbed birds may not have been foraging at
   maximum rates and vested periodically during the low tide period.
   Characteristic avoidance behaviour elicited by disturbance differed
   between the species; Curlew and Redshank typically stopped feeding and,
   if they left, flew away, whereas Oystercatcher walked away. This
   difference may be related to plumage crypsis. Flight distances of all
   species were very low. Habituation may be an important response to
   regular but benign disturbance, reducing the disturbance-induced
   decrease in feeding time to a level which may be compensated for, at
   least in summer within the normal late-tide foraging period.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier this century there were widespread reports, but little detail,
   of declining Merlin populations in Britain. A partial survey in 1983-84
   resulted in an estimate of 550-650 breeding pairs. Local studies have
   since reported increases, decreases and stability in Merlin populations.
   Against this background the RSPB organized the second breeding survey of
   Merlins in Britain during 1993 and 1994, to estimate the population and
   assess regional trends. This survey located 796 breeding pairs of
   Merlins and estimated a further minimum of 24 pairs from areas
   previously well surveyed, 53\% of the known breeding range. For the
   remainder of the range all extrapolated estimate of 471 pairs with 95\%
   confidence limits of 288-680 pairs was calculated following survey of 36
   10-km National Grid squares. A number of checks were made on survey
   efficiency and accuracy. It is recommended that a rounded figure of 1300
   +/- 200 pairs of breeding Merlins be used Its the revised population
   estimate for Britain. In all areas where comparisons were made between
   surveys, Merlins have increased or remained stable. Reasons or this are
   discussed, as is the logic behind the species being retained in the
   revised UK Red Data Bird list.}},

Abstract = {{We review the migratory movements of European Montagu's Harriers, based
   on 152 ringing recoveries (from data published up to 1993) and published
   data on counts at migratory convergence points. Data were analysed
   according to age groups and time of the year (pre- and post-breeding
   migration). Results showed two main migratory routes across the
   Mediterranean for the western European Montagu's Harriers (Gibraltar and
   the Sicily Channel). Passage frequency was higher in the post-breeding
   than the pre-breeding migration in the Gibraltar Strait, but the
   opposite occurred in the Sicily Channel. We discuss the possibility that
   Montagu's Harriers present a partially circular migration, maybe as a
   result of movements within the wintering areas. Recovery frequency
   varied according to age group, being lower for first-year birds than
   expected from random, which suggests that some first-year birds do not
   return to the breeding areas during their first summer.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 449 nest record cards collected by the British Trust for
   Ornithology during 1945-89 was used to examine timing of nesting and
   brood production of the Woodcock. Daily chick mortality rates were
   estimated from recaptures of 26 Woodcock broods during an intensive
   study in 1988-92. Clutches were initiated between March and July, with a
   mode at the end of March. On average, egg laying commenced earlier in
   England (median first-egg date 8 April) than in Scotland (20 April) and
   there were negative relationships between first-egg dates and mean March
   air temperatures, both between years and regionally within years. Nest
   survival during egg laying and incubation was 41 +/- 1\% and the mean
   number of clutches hatched per female alive in March was 0.89 (95\% CL
   0.47-1.58). Chick survival until fledging was estimated as 56 +/- 8\%,
   resulting in a mean annual production of 1.80 +/- 0.72 fledged young per
   female alive at the start of the breeding season. A small second peak in
   the distribution of first-egg dates in mid-May indicates that in some
   years females may attempt to rear second broods.}},

Abstract = {{Dunlin migration in northeast Italy is described. An attempt to identify
   the main routes and staging areas used by birds wintering in the central
   Mediterranean is presented. The results of monthly counts from 1990-1995
   revealed that the bulk of the population occupied the wintering area in
   October and left for the breeding grounds in April and May. The analysis
   of 342 Italian recoveries of foreign ringed birds showed that 65\% were
   ringed during post-breeding migration through the Baltic Sea, whereas
   just a few birds had been ringed in western Europe. First-year birds
   arrived in autumn with a single migratory wave, peaking in October Two
   categories of adults were identified during post-breeding migration:
   birds which directly reached Italian wintering sites and birds which
   arrived after they had suspended their migration for moulting: the
   Azov/Black Sea wetlands are suggested as possible moulting areas. Out of
   2444 adults and 1627 first-years ringed between 1989 and 1996 at our
   study area, we obtained a total of 42 recoveries abroad and evidence of
   direct links between Azov/Black Sea and N Adriatic wetlands, both during
   autumn and spying migrations. Primary moult was observed only in adults
   arriving early the second migratory wave being composed of moulted
   birds. Locally moulting adults adopted a moult strategy characterized by
   high raggedness scores, typical of resident moulters. Body mass was not
   affected by primary moult stage or intensity, winter mass values being
   reached two weeks after the average date of primary moult completion.}},

Abstract = {{The Nightjar populations of Yorkshire's upland forests have grown
   significantly during recent years, probably as a result of a concurrent
   increase in the available area of suitable habitat due to forest
   management. In common with other populations if appears that the birds
   utilize younger more open plantations. Comparison, based on discriminant
   analysis, of the habitat characteristics of forest plantations occupied
   and unoccupied by Nightjars suggests two things. First, that birds are
   move likely to occupy larger rather than smaller clearings and, second,
   that the study populations are close to their maxima. However, with
   continuing rotational felling, the area should continue to support a
   similar population.}},

Abstract = {{In a nine-year study of post-nuptial moult interruption in the Willow
   Warbler, three moult patterns were noted which differed from the normal
   pattern. All concerned late-breeding individuals. One pattern was to
   suspend moult after the first two inner primaries were renewed and
   recommence at the point of suspension when young had attained
   independence. Another pattern was a very slow renewal of inner primaries
   with adjacent feathers only dropped when previous ones were fully grown
   and subsequently proceeding into a full moult when young were
   independent. In the third pattern, birds commenced their moult at an
   earlier stage gf the breeding cycle, i.e. before young were independent.
   In all three patterns, post-nuptial moult would be completed earlier
   than if all birds waited until young achieved independence before moult
   seas initiated, as is usually the ease in adults with normal-timed
   broods.}},

Abstract = {{Many granivorous farmland birds in the UK have declined substantially
   since the 1970s, coinciding with widespread agricultural
   intensification. The population trend of the Yellowhammer is, however,
   unique, since after a long period of stability it started to decline in
   the late 1980s. This study quantifies Yellowhammer habitat associations
   on British farmland before and during the decline (1988 and 1993), using
   Common Birds Census (CBC) data from the British Trust for Ornithology.
   In both years, variation in Yellowhammer densities between farmland CBC
   plots was strongly correlated with three main habitat parameters.
   Yellowhammer density increased with the proportion of the plot area
   growing cereals, and with crop diversity and hedgerow length, and was
   highest at intermediate altitudes. Farms dominated by grass and
   non-cereal crops, and those lacking cereals were most likely to lose
   territories between 1988 and 1993. These results suggest that there, may
   be a critical availability of cereal cultivation below which
   Yellowhammer populations cannot persist, which may explain the recent
   pattern of range contraction in the pastoral north and west of the
   British Isles. They do not, however; explain the recent population
   decline recorded by the CBC in southern and eastern Britain, where
   cereal cultivation is predominant. This decline is probably not a direct
   consequence of summer land-use change, and requires further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an assessment of Cormorant occupancy and impact at
   stillwater game fisheries in England and Wales, during 1988/89 to
   1992/93. A total of 167 waterbodies operated as `put-and-take' trout
   fisheries was included within a questionnaire survey, and this provided
   the bulk of the data used in the analyses. The results show that
   Cormorants ave widespread at inland stillwater game fisheries in England
   and Wales throughout the year, with higher densities present during
   October-March. Peak counts by fishery managers at 45 of the fisheries
   increased by about 20\% per year, regardless of season. Site use by
   Cormorants is investigated and the results imply that large, low
   altitude sites that are close to rivers in southern England are more
   likely to be used by these birds. The survey revealed that Cormorants
   are widely perceived by fishery managers to be responsible for
   significant economic losses through consumption and/or injury of stock
   fish. While this may be justified locally we found no overall
   relationship between Cormorant density and anglers' catches of Rainbow
   Trout, the principal stock fish.}},

Abstract = {{Strangford Lough, County Down holds internationally important numbers of
   wintering Pale-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla hrota with peak
   counts of up to 16 000. In the past, the Lough was also important for
   overwintering Wigeon Anas penelope with peak counts up to 20 000 in the
   early 1970s. However, this population has declined drastically with
   winter peaks at fewer than 2000 since the mid-1980s. As the overall
   flyway numbers of Wigeon have not fallen over this period, it has been
   suggested that the reasons for the decline are intrinsic to Strangford
   Lough. Wigeon did not decline uniformly throughout Strangford Lough. The
   greatest fall in numbers occurred on the northern mudflats suggesting a
   decline in carrying capacity. Factors responsible for this decline may
   include the reduction of Eelgrass Zostera spp. which is the main food of
   both species, and increases in human activity near and on the foreshore,
   especially in the case of Wigeon. Indirect interspecific interactions
   between Brent Geese and Wigeon are discussed as they may have been
   significant in reducing the numbers of Wigeon in the system.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of Corncrakes during mechanized mowing of hay and silage
   was investigated by tracking radio-tagged females with broods and
   observing chicks escaping from meadows or being killed by the mower.
   Except in the case of very young chicks, Corncrakes were found to move
   away from mowers far and fast enough to avoid being overtaken, provided
   that an escape route to a refuge area was available. During mowing of
   meadows from the outside inwards (O-I), chicks stayed in the isolated
   plot of unmown grass until the last few swaths remained to be mown and
   55\% were killed. Mowing from the centre of the meadow outwards (O-I)
   has been reported to reduce chick mortality because chicks are able to
   escape to unmown cover outside the meadow without leaving the shelter of
   tall grass. However, the present study showed that chick mortality was
   also lower (32\%) during I-O than O-I mowing when the grass bordering
   the plot being mown had already been cut. In these circumstances the
   proportion of chicks that escaped was highest for the oldest chicks and
   when the width of the mown strip that the birds have to cross to escape
   was narrow. Chicks were less likely to be killed by I-O than O-I mowing
   even when the width of open ground to be crossed was similar for both
   methods. It is estimated that leaving refuge strips of unmown grass
   would reduce chick mortality when there is little natural escape cover
   at the edges of meadows being mown I-O.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine nest site selection by Hen Harriers
   Circus cyaneus at two spatial scales in Scotland and to assess whether
   breeding success was influenced by choice of nest site. At the landscape
   scale, toe compared availability and utilization of habitats in 610
   km(2) of Argyll, and at the local scale, we compared vegetation and
   topography at 52 harrier nests and random points within three averts of
   heather moorland covering a total area of 462 km(2). At both scales,
   harriers showed a clear preference for nesting in heather. Within
   heather moorland, harriers nested in taller heather (average height
   46cm) and nearer streams than expected by chalice. More nests were on
   northwest-facing slopes than expected by chance. We found no evidence
   that breeding success was influenced by habitat or topography. Heather
   moorland is declining in the uplands due to overgrazing and
   afforestation. The association of harriers with heather suggests that
   their future may become increasingly dependent on moorland, where
   heather is maintained for grouse.}},

   Owls at Woodwalton Fen National Nature Reserve, wicker baskets of

   incubation, 59.2\% hatched young and 50.7\% fledged one or more chicks.
   In only two nests wee the complete clutches hatched and fledged. Early
   nesters laid larger clutches and raised more broods than those nesting
   later in the season. It is suggested that the level of the water table
   and the management regime necessary for the restoration of open fen

Abstract = {{In southwest England most Barn Owls nest and roost in old barns and the
   practice of converting these into dwellings is well known. Sites
   containing Barn Owls which were due for conversion were selected to
   determine the effect of such developments on local distribution and
   status. Twenty study areas of 1.5 km radius were studied for an average
   of 40 months. Within each study area every potential roosting or nesting
   site was searched every four months. The occupation of sites by Barn
   Owls, habitat quality and rodenticide use were recorded. Within some
   study areas the central (occupied) site remained unchanged. Within
   others it was lost through conversion or demolition. The loss of a
   single occupied site was shown to have a marked effect upon the resident
   birds which generally abandoned not only the lost site but also other
   nearby sites. It is concluded that the loss of one occupied site can
   have a disproportionally large negative effect even in areas where
   numerous alternative sites exist.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of mass and linear body dimensions (bill, tarsus and wing length)
   was studied in the Little Stint Calidris minuta at several locations on
   the Taimyr Peninsula, Siberia (73 degrees-76 degrees N) in 1983-94.
   Little Stints fledged at near-adult body mass, at 15 days of age. Growth
   followed an S-shaped pattern which was best described mathematically by
   a logistic curve. Curves of this type showed that growth was similar
   between study sites and years, although there were differences in mass
   development during the first days after hatching, perhaps related to
   weather conditions. When the logistic growth curve was used, K-L (the
   standard measure of maximum growth rate) was 0.285. Conversion of this
   parameter to another S-shaped curve, the Gompertz curve which has been
   widely used to describe wader chick growth, yields K-G = 0.194. This is
   higher than predicted from an allometric relationship based on 15 other
   precocial wader species, and might be related to the Little Stint's high
   latitude breeding range.}},

Abstract = {{The status of the Dotterel in northern England as a migrant and breeding
   bird is considered. Data for spring and autumn passage were largely from
   information collated by local recorders and data on breeding were
   collected by a few enthusiastic individuals. The pattern of spring
   passage has changed since the 19th century. Few birds are now seen on
   the coastal plain of northwest England, 76\% of birds being seen in the
   uplands above 300 m. In total, 41 breeding records were available for
   analysis and it is suggested that in good years up to five pairs may
   breed. Potentially the breeding capacity of northern England would
   appear to be much greater; even on recent evidence breeding has occurred
   on a minimum of 12 fells, but never on more than three fells in any one
   year. The mean date for completion of first clutches of 23 May and the
   mean clutch size of 2.85 are little changed from previous periods and
   comparable to the situation in the central Grampians, Scotland. Where
   full nest histories were known, hatching and fledging success were 1.45
   chicks hatched and 1.07 chicks fledged per clutch. Reasons for the
   failure of Dotterel to colonize northern England to a greater extent are
   discussed; possible factors include habitat changes linked to increased
   acidification of soils and larger numbers of sheep on the hills in
   spring and increased recreational use of the hills. The status of the
   Dotterel in northern England still remains that of a regular spring
   migrant but a scarce breeder with a tenuous foothold in the region.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the best measure of body size for a range of
   passerine species, from data provided by British bird observatories. For
   each species we determine the proportion of variance in body mass
   explained by wing length, tarsus length, tail length and head length
   (head + bill) by multiple regression, while also accounting for variance
   due to two condition components of mass, measured as fat and muscle
   scores. Across 26 species ranging in mean mas from 5.3 g (Goldcrest) to
   100.3 g (Blackbird), fat score was consistently either the best
   predictor of mass (14 species) or in the set of significant predictors
   (21 species); muscle score was the best predictor of mass in only one
   species and a significant predictor in nine. Amongst linear measures,
   wing length was consistently the best size predictor. The first
   principal component of size (PC1) based on the four linear measurements
   frequently explained more variance in mass than wing length alone but
   the improvement was generally small. Reproducibility of measurements was
   generally better for wing length than for other linear measures, and in
   some cases very much better. On the basis of these findings, we
   recommend the following: wing length is used to give the best general
   measure of body size within species of passerines; fat and muscle
   scores, together with total body mass, are recorded to assess individual
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Nest survival was studied in relation to nest position of 164 nests of
   the Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus in the Southeastern part of the
   Czech Republic in 1993. Breeding was successful in 91 (55.5\%) cases,
   whereas 40 (24.4\%) were predated, 19 (11.6\%) were parasitized by the
   Cuckoo Cuculus canorus and 14 (8.5\%) were destroyed by other causes. Of
   the predated nests, small mammals accounted for 26 (65.0\%) and unknown
   predators for 14 (35.0\%) nests. Rates of predation and parasitism
   varied in relation to a series of habitat factors and Reed Warblers
   avoided nest sites most vulnerable to predation or parasitism. Concealed
   places in the vegetation far away from trees were the safest nest sites.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of Yellowhammers flying from nests to foraging sites were
   used to assess use of foraging habitats in relation to availability.
   Selection of invertebrates by foraging Yellowhammers was studied using
   analysis of nestling faecal samples in relation to invertebrate samples
   taken from farmland habitats. Both data sets were analysed using
   compositional analysis. Broad-leaved crops and sparsely vegetated areas
   wee favoured early in the breeding season, but cereal crops were
   increasingly used as these ripened. Unripe cereal grain formed a major
   component of nestling diet, but invertebrates were fed to all broods.
   Lepidoptera larvae, Araneae and Tipulidae were consumed more than other
   invertebrate groups. Nestling mortality was high during cold weather
   when these invertebrates would have been inactive. We suggest that
   farming systems that increase habitat diversity and reduce pesticide
   application to arable crops will benefit Yellowhammers and other
   farmland buntings.}},

Abstract = {{The recent expansion of the Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo population in
   Europe has Zed to management conflict throughout Europe, increasing the
   relevance of describing the migration pattern of each country's breeding
   population. We use 2279 recoveries and 16 769 resightings of 4735
   colour-ringed individuals to describe dispersal and timing of movements
   of Danish Cormorants. Most Cormorants dispersed from the colonies to
   coastal areas and freshwater lakes in Denmark, Sweden and northern
   Germany in July. Southward movements took place throughout July to
   December. Major departure from the post-breeding areas occurred from
   August to mid-October, with many birds staging at Dutch and Alpine lakes
   between September and October, and with arrival in the Mediterranean
   mainly from October to November. Spring migration was fast, occurring
   from mid-February to March. First-year birds migrated south faster and
   reached the wintering areas sooner than adults, but left these later and
   moved north more slowly than adults. Wintering occurred from Portugal in
   the west to Greece in the east, and from Denmark in the north to North
   Africa in the south. The majority of Cormorants spent the winter in
   Mediterranean France, Italy Yugoslavia, Albania, Algeria and in
   particular in Tunisia. Adult males stayed closer to the breeding areas
   in winter than females, and adults tended to winter further north than
   first-year birds. Sex differences in body size and advantages of
   arriving early at the breeding sites may explain why males wintered
   further north than females.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term mark-recapture data were used to estimate the annual survival
   rates of Redshank wintering on the Moray Firth in Scotland. Survival
   modelling required the exclusion of all birds caught during the main
   passage months (August, March and April), and a highly variable annual
   catching effort limited the precision of annual survival estimates.
   Survival rates of juvenile Redshank (between the first and second
   winters of life) varied markedly from year to year and averaged 43\% (se
   3.6\%). Adult survival rates were less variable between years and were
   age-dependent, with 67\% (se 5.0\%) surviving and returning between the
   second and third winters of life, compared to 74\% (se 1.4\%) for older
   birds. Year-to-year variation in adult survival was weakly (and
   negatively) related to the number of snow days in winter Year-to-year
   variation in first-year survival was non-linearly related to winter
   rainfall, with low survival during dry (and cold) winters, higher
   survival during winters with average rainfall and lower survival during
   wet winters. Having accounted for these weather relationships there was
   no evidence that survival was related to the size of the local wintering
   Redshank population. Organized annual ringing programmes of wintering
   waders on British estuaries have the potential to monitor long-term
   changes in survival rates and productivity. Although constant effort
   sampling may be difficult to achieve for wintering waders, the utility
   of mark-recapture data collected on estuaries is likely to depend
   heavily on careful study design.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of breeding Greenshank Tringa nebularia was undertaken in 1995,
   based on a stratified sample of 5-km squares selected at random from the
   UK breeding range. Approximately 8\% of the breeding range was surveyed.
   Surveyors visited 101 survey squares twice in the breeding season,
   covering suitable dry areas to within 500 nr, and all tact areas. Any
   Greenshank recorded were mapped. Breeding densities varied from zero to
   art estimated 1.4 `territories' per km(2). The survey produced
   population estimates of 1440 summering `pairs' (95\% confidence limits:
   1100-1790), based on half the peak count of adults, and 870 pairs with
   young (95\% confidence limits: 570-1200). The distribution of sightings
   within survey squares was used to derive a possible mean territory
   radius of 800 in. Interpreting survey maps using this figure, art
   estimate of 1080 occupied breeding `territories' was produced (95\%
   confidence limits: 720-1480). Information is also presented on the
   altitudes of Greenshank sightings, variations in Greenshank
   `detectability' through the survey period and regional variation in
   Greenshank abundance. The survey In?ls down a baseline for long-term
   population monitoring of Greenshank by a repeatable method.}},

Abstract = {{In the years 1989-95, feral North American Mink caused widespread
   whole-colony breeding failures of Black-headed Culls, Common Gulls and
   Common Terns at colonies on small islands in a study area along 1000 km
   of mainland coast in west Scotland. After one or more years of such
   failure, most of the affected breeding sites held no birds or greatly
   reduced numbers. In some cases movement to new or existing colonies suns
   detected; birds sometimes found mink-free islands and bred successfully
   By 1996, mink had had two distinct long-term effects on breeding numbers
   and distribution of these species. (1) In 1987 the study area contained
   1839 breeding pairs of Common Terns (one-eighth of the British Isles
   total). By 1996 they had decreased by 36\% to 1179 pairs. Between 1989
   and 1996, Black-headed Culls and Common Gulls decreased by 52\% and
   30\%. There was no evidence that birds had left the area and, subject to
   certain assumptions, these decreases were largely accounted for by known
   predation of eggs and chicks by mink. (2) Discrete areas such as
   archipelagoes, sea lochs, firths and sounds lost all or nearly all
   breeding seabirds as a result of such movements from affected islands.
   Mink predation is widespread but difficult to detect and should be
   considered as a possible cause when seabird colonies near the mainland
   decline and disappear.}},

   measurements taken varied significantly between the sexes, but
   head-and-bill length and bill depth were the best discriminant

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Nest sites used by Herring Gulls and Lesser Black-backed Gulls in a
   mixed colony were compared. Correlations between features surrounding a
   nest and breeding success at different stages of the breeding cycle are
   presented. Lesser Black-backed Gulls nested on more vegetated and
   flatter areas than did Herring Gulls, even though the latter species had
   a lower hatching success at less vegetated sites. The difference in the
   general topography of nest sites between the species suggests that the
   Lesser Black-backed Gull, through an individual defence strategy, may be
   better adapted to use sites which are accessible to ground predators
   than the Herring Gull. The fledging success of Lesser Black-backed Gulls
   tended to increase with an increased proportion of relatively tall
   vegetation close to the nest. The Lesser Black-backed Gull may therefore
   be able to leave its young unattended and rely on their concealment for
   protection against predators. In contrast, the Herring Gull may rely
   more on parental vigilance to protect young. More frequent attendance by
   adult Herring Gulls at the nest site during chick rearing compared with
   lesser Black-backed Gulls supports this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of the habitat requirements of river birds are central to
   understanding their distribution and abundance. Here, we make an initial
   appraisal of the suitability for this purpose of a new standardized
   method of river habitat survey (RHS) developed by the Environment Agency
   (EA). We carried out RHS and recorded the presence of five common birds
   along 74 upland Welsh streams. RHS provided significant and meaningful
   correlates with bird distribution: Dippers Cinclus cinclus and Grey
   Wagtails Motacilla cinerea showed a significant preference for sites
   with tree-related features, while Common Sandpiper Actitis hypoleucos
   preferred streams with few trees but with more rough pasture and
   riparian wetlands. Dippers also showed a significant preference for
   streams with bridges and walls, often used as nesting or roosting sites.
   Mallards Anas platyrhynchos and Goosanders Mergus merganser both
   preferred sites with smoother flows, finer substrates and more emergent
   vegetation. For all species, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) on RHS
   data predicted presence with a success rate of 50-81\%. The distribution
   of Grey Wagtails and Dippers was best predicted by RHS variables from
   the channel, flow, bank and riparian zone; Common Sandpiper and
   Goosander distribution teas predicted best by channel and flow
   characters, and that of Mallard by channel features alone. In three
   species (Dipper Goosander and Mallard) stream chemistry (pH) improved
   predictive ability. We conclude that RHS, although designed initially
   for move general purposes, is a potentially important tool for
   describing and predicting river bird distribution. Future developments
   should include assessments of which RHS data best predict bird
   distribution across a wider army of river types and species.
   Incorporating other important influences on distribution, such as water
   chemistry, should both enhance predictive ability and allow further
   development to the role of river birds as ecological indicators.}},

   210 regurgitate pellets were collected, containing the remains of 1648
   and 1655 prey items, respectively. There was no significant difference
   in the taxonomic composition of the diet as represented by the two
   pellet types, i.e. no taxon was under- or over-represented in either
   pellet type. There were few differences between prey sizes in the faecal
   and regurgitate pellets from the same site and sampling time. Where
   significant differences were found, the absolute difference between the
   medians was small and it was the faecal sample which had the larger
   median prey size. There was no evidence that Dippers use regurgitates to
   eject the remains of large prey.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{348-354}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In capture-recapture studies, productivity is usually estimated as the
   ratio of juveniles to adults trapped. However, because the validity of
   productivity estimations relies on the assumption that the ratio of the
   capture probabilities for adults and young does not vary over samples,
   the use of several trapping methods, with different associated capture
   probabilities for each age, could lead to erroneous inferences on
   productivity. We investigated how the use of different trapping methods
   can affect the estimated age ratio of the sampled population. We used
   the captures of 5377 Serins Serinus serinus trapped from April to
   September in the years 1985 to 1994 in a suburban area of Barcelona
   (northeast Spain). There were three trapping methods: mist-nets, a
   Yunick platform trap and a clap-net. A multifactorial approach using
   log-linear analyses showed that mist-nets captured a significantly
   higher proportion of juveniles than the other two methods. The tray
   captured more adults, and to a lesser extent yearlings. The clap-net
   produced an intermediate age ratio. Results support the view that
   trapping method can influence the age untie sample of the population,
   and emphasizes the need for caution when analysing population parameters
   from different bird trapping methods.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the importance of habitat quality and habitat
   heterogeneity for the abundance and diversity of breeding birds in
   continuous forest and in forest fragments surrounded by farmland in
   central Sweden. Positive correlations were found between species number
   and area, volume of Aspen Populus tremula and habitat heterogeneity.
   Spatial segregation of habitats at a relatively fine-grained scale is
   suggested to allow for the co-occurrence of more species. The abundance
   of at least 18 of the species in this study was influenced by
   fragmentation, and nine of these species preferred fragments to forest
   sites. The total density of virus was higher in fragments than in forest
   sites, probably because several fragment species forage in farmland
   surrounding the sites and a few also forage at edges. Nine species were
   more common in forest sites than in fragments, but only one species was
   restricted to continuous forest. However, several fragments were
   relatively close to forests (150 m) and forest was common in larger
   scale contexts. The abundance of most species (25 of 33 species) in this
   study was correlated with habitat quality variables (i.e. variables
   measuring the size, volume and diversity of `tree species'). Among these
   habitat variables the most important tons the occurrence of deciduous
   trees which seemed to be important for 14 species. The second most
   important habitat factor seemed to be the diameter of trees, which was
   positively correlated with the abundance of eight species of which five
   are hole-nesters. Among coniferous trees, six species were positively
   correlated with the volume of Norway Spruce Picea abies, whereas no
   species seemed to be correlated with the volume of Pine Pinus
   sylvestris.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology of passerines using saltmarshes in winter is poorly known.
   The distribution and abundance of passerines on the Taff/Ely saltmarshes
   were studied between October 1983 and March 1984. Twenty-two species of
   passerine were recorded. Their numbers fluctuated irregularly throughout
   the winter. The four most abundant species, Skylark, Chaffinch, Meadow
   Pipit and Reed Bunting, showed preferences for certain plant
   communities. Skylarks shifted from the Asteretum community to
   Spartinetum, and Chaffinches from the Asteretum to a mixed-species
   community as winter progressed. Faecal analysis showed that both species
   consumed seeds from similar plants but took them in different
   proportions.}},

Abstract = {{Most known aspects of the breeding biology of the Chiffchaff come from
   studies carried out in Central Europe. This study documents aspects of
   its breeding biology in Britain by comparing data gathered during an
   intensive study in Wytham Woods (Oxford) from 1992 to 1994, and records
   from 1933 to 1993 held by the BTO's Nest Record Scheme. Comparison of
   these two data sets showed close similarities in parameters such as: (1)
   laying dates; (2) length of the breeding season; (3) nest site usage;
   (4) clutch size; (5) length of the nestling period; and (6) the relative
   importance of causes of nest failure. First clutches are laid in the
   second half of April, and early May, with second clutches in June. Nests
   are built close to the ground, usually in Bramble bushes (Rubus spp.).
   Average clutch size decreases front 6 to 4 eggs through the season.
   Incubation and nesting periods last 13-14 days. Nest losses are mainly
   due to predation, which accounted for approximately 75\% of losses in
   both data sets, and the Weasel (Mustela nivalis) appears to be the main
   predator in Wytham Woods.}},

Abstract = {{The laying dare, clutch size, brood size and number of fledged young
   were recorded from Buzzard nests at several study areas in mid-Argyll.
   These data are compared with other published studies to see if there are
   regional trends in breeding biology in Britain. Laying dates are
   remarkably constant throughout Britain. There are, however, highly
   significant differences in clutch size between study areas. These do not
   follow any latitudinal gradient and it is likely that local factors such
   as habitat and prey availability are more important determinants of
   clutch size. In particular clutch size was found to be low in areas
   where Rabbits were scarce and birds were an important component of the
   diet. There were also marked differences in hatching and fledging
   success between different areas in Britain. Buzzards in Argyll, despite
   laying comparatively small-sized clutches, have among the highest
   fledging success of any area. This is largely due to high egg survival.
   Human predation is unimportant in Argyll, but in some other areas of
   Britain it contributed to reduced breeding success.}},

   provided by road transects during winter (> 90\%) and breeding seasons
   (85\%). The estimation of densities from distances to the transect did
   not provide more accurate results than unadjusted counts. On the
   contrary, skip counts may consistently bias population estimates in
   species that are attracted by roads, or may provide unpredictably
   unrealistic results when the number of observations is low. Winter roost
   counts made in areas of high breeding density apparently underestimated
   the real populations, because resident Red Kites usually do not use
   roosts, and this was detected through the results obtained in road
   transects. No clear effect was found of forest cover on the
   detectability of Red Kites, probably due to their selection of open
   areas for hunting. Road transects seem to be a reliable method to
   estimate the numbers of Red Kites, and probably of other species of
   similar habits and size.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology of Montagu's Harrier in an agricultural
   habitat at various breeding sites in Extremadura (southwest Spain).
   Clear latitudinal trends were observed on laying date and clutch size
   compared to other Western Palearctic populations: as laying starts
   earlier, clutch size declines in southern populations. Climate and
   feeding could be the main factors involved. In addition to natural
   factors, the species' use of cultivated areas as nesting habitat at
   Southern latitudes is the major determinant of breeding success.
   Artificial nest management at harvest time has been shown to be
   effective in reducing losses due to fanning activities. Such
   conservation measures reduce the mortality rate of nestlings and
   consequently increase the reproductive success of breeding pairs.
   Nevertheless, endogenous factors related to individual breeding
   condition limit the effect of artificial nest management. Mediterranean
   populations of Montagu's Harrier seem to be highly dependent on
   conservation measures because of the high failure rates for breeding in
   the absence of such intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The first national survey of breeding Red-throated Divers Gavia stellata
   in Britain teas carried out in 1994. It was based on two visits to all
   standing freshwater in Shetland and Orkney, and to a sample elsewhere in
   the species' range in Scotland (Inner and Outer Hebrides and mainland).
   The survey located an estimated 855 breeding pairs (95\% CI 735-990) and
   1295 (95\% CI 1075-1525) non-breeding adults. About 12\% of birds that
   were recorded as non-breeding probably bred, but were not proved to do
   so; taking these into account the corrected total population for
   Scotland was estimated at 935 breeding pairs, with approximately 430
   (46\%) of these in Shetland, 105 (11\%) in Orkney and 400 (43\%)
   elsewhere in Scotland. In fetal, there were an estimated 3010 (95\% CI
   2685-3360) adult Red-throated Divers in Scotland during summer 1994. The
   Red-throated Diver population in Shetland has declined by more than a
   third since 1983, that in Orkney is probably stable and trends elsewhere
   are unknown. A comparison with Red-throated Diver populations on the
   Northern Isles showed that on the mainland densities were very much
   lower that a smaller proportion of the birds present bred, that they did
   so on much larger lochs and that when they did breed they were less
   successful. In Shetland, breeding pairs on small lochs were more
   successful than those on large lochs; some potential reasons for this
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study of wintering bird communities
   across a wide range of coniferous, broadleaved and mixed forest stands
   in the Forest of Dean, western England. Bird communities of broadleaved
   and coniferous woodland differed with respect to their species
   composition. The mean number of individual birds recorded increased
   linearly with woodland age and was not influenced by woodland type,
   stand size or the presence of grazing. Woodland age and type and the
   presence or absence of grazing all significantly influenced bird species
   richness and the proportions of the bird community made up by
   granivores, insectivores and omnivores. Broadleaved stands held more
   species than coniferous stands. Ungrazed stands held significantly more
   species, particularly seed-eating species, than grazed stands and this
   effect was independent of woodland type. Ordination was used to relate
   variation in tree species composition and stand structure to bird
   community composition. A larger number of species was associated with
   broadleaved stands and stands with abundant undergrowth than was
   associated with coniferous stands or stands with little undergrowth.
   Woodland age had less effect on bird community composition than the
   extent of undergrowth and the conifer to broadleaf ratio. The results of
   this work have relevance to the enhancement of winter bird communities
   in commercial forests.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown a relationship between the number of Dunlin
   breeding on moorland sites in Caithness and Sutherland and the
   near-infrared reflectance of the sites measured from satellite imagery.
   We test the generality of this relationship using two images of
   Caithness and Sutherland recorded 12 years apart, and new imagery and
   survey data from the Shetland Islands. The correlation between Dunlin
   abundance and near-infrared reflectance is similar using both images of
   Caithness and Sutherland but no correlation is apparent in Shetland.
   This regional difference is explained by relating the spectral
   characteristics of sites in both study areas to ground cover data
   recorded from field surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The results of annual censuses of a Golden Plover population in the Peak
   District, covering 24 years, are analysed. A strong density-dependent
   effect of the population in the previous year explained 26.7\% of the
   variation in population growth. An additional 15.3\% of the variation
   was accounted for by the severity of winter weather, as measured by mean
   monthly air temperature for November to February. There was no
   significant effect of weather during the breeding season upon Golden
   Plover population size, implying that any effects which spring and
   summer temperature or rainfall may have upon fledging success are masked
   by other factors. The importance of these results is discussed in the
   light of work on other wader species, and possible declines in Golden
   Plover numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Brood production rate of Grey Partridges Perdix perdix was studied in
   three areas in Poland ill the years 1986-90, by comparing the number of
   pairs and the number of family coveys after the breeding period. In the
   study areas, linear permanent nesting cover was mapped and measured. In
   these areas the brood production rate declined with increasing spring
   pair density. A positive effect of the occurrence of nesting cover on
   brood production rate was found. An increase in the population density
   mostly occurred through occupying parts of the study area avoided
   earlier, thus presumably less suitable for Partridges. Pairs occupying
   these less suitable areas, characterized by less abundant nesting cover,
   had a lower brood production rate, whereas in the preferred areas this
   rate did not decline with increasing mean population density.}},

Abstract = {{Existing morphological sex-determination criteria for Continental
   European Robins proved inadequate when applied to birds captured in

   criteria resulting in the classification of 2\% males and 47\% females
   respectively. This article presents a primer for correct sexing of
   Robins by amplification of a female-specific DNA element by a polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) on genomic DNA. Further, two new criteria for
   sex-determination are proposed based on logistic regression and
   discriminant function analysis using morphological measures from birds
   with DNA-verified sex. Success rates of 80-81\% for the new criteria
   were a considerable improvement compared with a success rate of only
   36\% for the old criteria.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and distribution of breeding Goosanders and Red-breasted
   Mergansers were surveyed along river habitats throughout Britain in the
   spring and summer of 1987. Broad-scale habitat information was recorded
   and a total of around 9300 km of rivers was surveyed. The densities of
   Goosanders were highest in the Borders and northwest England, and those
   of Red-breasted Mergansers in the Highlands and western Scotland. The
   influence of river characteristics, including width, flow type, extent
   of bankside cover, elevation and gradient on the choice of habitats by
   sa sawmills was assessed using logistic regression models. River width
   had a significant influence on the presence of Goosanders and
   Mergansers, with wider river sections more likely to hold birds. The
   probability of recording Goosanders decreased with increasing river
   gradient while Mergansers preferred slower, smoother river sections.
   Taking these results into account, regional and national populations of
   both species were estimated by extrapolation from river sections
   surveyed to the total extent of river habitat available, as estimated by
   map measurements. Standing waters, by which both species nest, were not
   included in this survey. The limitations of this approach are discussed.
   National populations on river habitats were estimated to be 2600 (95\%
   confidence limits CLs at 2333 and 2890) adult male and 3700 (95\% CLs at
   3272 and 4072) redhead Goosanders, and 800 (95\% CLs at 562 and 1051)
   adult male and 750 (95\% CLs at 562 and 964) redhead Mergansers.}},

Abstract = {{During the breeding season of 1994, a survey of Larus gulls nesting on
   buildings and other malt-made structures in Britain and Ireland teas
   carried out to determine their distribution and abundance, and to assess
   the changes that had occurred since the last survey in 1976. The two
   main species involved were Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with
   records received of 11047 pairs and 2544 pairs, respectively. Estimated
   numbers may be as high as 16900 pairs of Herring Gulls and 3200 pairs of
   Lesser Black-backed Gulls, constituting 8.2\% and 3.6\%, respectively,
   of the total breeding populations of these species in Britain and
   Ireland. Since 1976, gulls nesting on buildings have continued to
   increase, both in terms of the number of breeding pairs (Herring Gulls
   by 10\% per annum; Lesser Black-backed Gulls by 17\% per annum) and the
   number of sites colonized (Herring Gulls by 5\% per annum; Lesser
   Black-backed Gulls by 13\% per annum). This increase has been greatest
   in the Lesser Black-backed Gull, but that of the Herring Gull is of
   particular interest as its numbers in Britain and Ireland have declined
   during this period. Records were received of 236 pairs of Common Gulls
   and 11 pairs of Great Black-backed Gulls nesting on buildings. In most
   areas, coastal towns have now been colonized by roof-nesting gulls and
   sites further inland are being colonized, especially by Lesser
   Black-backed Culls. There has been an increased colonization of
   industrial sites in towns since 1976 and this has led to the formation
   of much denser colonies than previously found in urban areas. Small
   colonies of Herring Gulls nesting on rooftops increase in size at a
   higher rate than large colonies, although the actual numerical increase
   is still greater in larger colonies. There is Mo evidence of established
   colonies of roof-nesting gulls disappearing naturally and the rapid
   increase in size of small colonies means that they become established
   very quickly, often before they are perceived as a problem. Considerable
   effort has been put into attempting to reduce the numbers of gulls
   nesting in some towns. As yet, however, no successful management methods
   have been developed.}},

   All colour-ringed Purple Sandpipers and a high proportion of

   the study area throughout the winter. All Purple Sandpipers and a high
   proportion of Turnstones (81-88\%) survived the winter. Reasons for the
   high winter survival rates of both species in comparison with other
   waders are discussed. Most Turnstones (83-88\%) survived between spring
   and autumn and came back to Hartlepool, usually to the same feeding
   area. A lower proportion of Purple Sandpipers (57-77\%) survived through
   the summer to return to Hartlepool, particularly in 1993; some returned
   to winter elsewhere. Annual survival and summer return rates of both

Abstract = {{In Cadiz Bay, southwest Spain, salt pans and fish ponds in the
   saltmarshes provide an important additional source of food to intertidal
   flats for many waders (Charadrii) during the winter. As little is known
   about the diet of waders in Spain in general, and in saline ponds in
   particular, droppings and pellets produced by waders were collected from
   the ponds and mudflats, and analysed for the remains of prey. Direct
   observations of feeding birds were also made. The diets of Redshank
   Tringa tetanus, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Curlew Numenius
   arquata, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa
   lapponica, Ringed Plover Charadrius hiaticula, Kentish Plover Charadrius
   alexandrinus, Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus, Dunlin Calidris
   alpina, Little Stint Calidris minuta and Sanderling Calidris alba were
   investigated in this way, with particular attention being paid to the
   saline ponds. Compared with the results from studies made in the winter
   in northern Europe, many of the waders in the Bay took many insects and,
   surprisingly, also the seeds of saltmarsh plants.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of visits to nests of open-nesting passerines was
   investigated over two years using a randomized sampling design; the only
   such study ever undertaken in the UK. There was no overall effect of
   nest visiting on nesting success (the analysis had a power of 85\% to
   detect a difference of 10\% in success rates between control and visited
   nests). However, although thrushes and insectivores appeared to be
   beneficially affected by nest visiting, finches were detrimentally
   affected by nest visiting in one of the years. The effect of nest
   visiting did not differ between habitat, categorized into farmland,
   woodland and garden. The degree of exposure of the nest had no effect on
   nesting success bur increases in the degree of disturbance made to a
   nest's surroundings paradoxically appeared to increase nesting success.
   A brief review of studies undertaken outside the UK also reveals little
   evidence for any effect of nest visiting on passerine nest success.}},

Abstract = {{The survival rates and outcomes of Cirl Bunting nests were recorded over
   a four-year period. Significant annual variations in nest survival were
   found at both the egg and the young stage. Significant seasonal
   variations in survival rates were found, with late nests being over
   twice as likely to produce fledglings as early ones. Most losses
   occurred at the chick stage early in the season and were due to
   predation and starvation. Chicks in poor condition through food shortage
   may have been more likely to be predated as a result of increased
   begging activity. Late season chicks had a very different diet to those
   hatched early in the season, being fed a much higher proportion of
   Orthoptera. They also enjoyed higher growth rates and survival. Rainfall
   had a small detrimental effect on growth rates, probably as a result of
   insect prey becoming hard to find. Loss of arthropods due to
   intensification of livestock farming and loss of diversity in the
   agricultural landscape may have contributed to the decline of the
   species in the UK.}},

Abstract = {{National censuses of the globally threatened Marbled Teal were organized
   in Spain in 1994 and 1995 during the prebreeding, breeding and
   post-breeding periods. This is the first derailed study of the status
   and distribution of the species in any country. The censuses revealed a
   drastic decrease in Marbled Teal numbers in the Guadalquivir marshes in
   Andalucia (their former stronghold) but numbers in the other main
   subpopulation in Valencia region are not currently in decline. The
   average national count (excluding pulli) was 55 in 1994 and 50 in 1995.
   In 1994, 75\% of birds and 86\% of broods were recorded in Valencia
   region, with 23\% of birds and 14\% of broods in Andalucia and 3\% of
   birds in Murcia. In 1995, 91\% of birds and 95\% of broods were recorded
   in Valencia region, with 9\% of birds and 8\% of broods in Andalucia.
   The censuses provide evidence of movements from the Guadalquivir marshes
   to Valencia during the breeding season, in response to severe drought in
   the former area.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental factors correlating with the time of first meriting
   arrival at a feeding station were investigated for Blue Tits Parus
   caeruleus, Great Tits P. major and Coal Tits P. ater over two years.
   Year-round, the arrival times (related to both sunrise and civil
   twilight correlated primarily with daylength and cloud cover, but this
   disguised marked seasonal variation in the environmental correlates. In
   winter, daylength remained the primary positive correlate but was of
   little importance in spring and summer. In autumn, daylength teas
   negatively correlated with arrival rime. Temperature correlated with
   arrival time mainly in spring, early summer and autumn; only male Great
   Tits' arrival correlated with temperature in winter. Female Blue Tits
   and Coal Tits arrived first, followed its order by male Great Tits, male
   Blue Tits and female Great Tits. These changes in foraging behaviour are
   interpreted as responses to seasonal changes in energy demand and the
   effects of interspecific competition when there are either environmental
   constraints on foraging time and profitability as in winter, or
   conflicts with other essential behaviours as in spring.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the numbers and activity of Lapwings Vanellus vanellus and
   Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria using 322 ha of lowland farmland were
   examined in relation to temperature, rainfall, wind speed and moonphase.
   The study teas undertaken over two winters (1987/88 and 1988/89), with
   maximum counts of 4000 Lapwings and 820 Golden Plovers. Patterns of
   occupancy of the study area and seasonal occurrence are described.
   Temperature and the phase of the lunar cycle seemed to be particularly
   important in affecting the distribution and activity of the birds. Move
   Lapwings occurred in the study area on the colder and on the wetter days
   in several months, and also around the full moon period when feeding
   activity was particularly prevalent. A higher proportion of Lapwings
   tended to feed on colder days and around the new moon period, while
   daytime leafing increased around the full moon period. These results
   support the ideas that birds need to feed more in cold conditions, when
   energy demands are high, and that night feeding frequently occurs during
   the full moon period, although the reasons for this remain unclear.}},

Abstract = {{The Exe Estuary (southern England) was recolonized by the expanding
   wintering population of dark-bellied Brent Geese during the 1960s;
   Wigeon numbers have decreased since their return, but numbers of both
   species have been stable since 1982. Brent Goose and Wigeon feeding
   behaviour was studied at two Exe intertidal Zostera beds during
   1990-1992, to assess the overlap in time and space of these two
   herbivorous waterfowl, apparently feeding upon the same food resource.
   Results showed less than 5.5\% overlap between the two species using
   either Zostera bed. From arrival in autumn, Brent Geese extracted
   rhizomes in softest substrates and consumed whole plants, mostly in an
   area with low-ride pools. Previous studies have shown that Brent Geese
   only probed for Zostera rhizomes after shoot biomass has been much
   reduced. Wigeon fed elsewhere on the same flats by dabbling the floating
   above-ground parts of Zostera only in water retained by the physical
   characteristics of the Zostera beds. Despite this spatial separation,
   some exploitative competition must occur through the removal by Brent
   Geese of potential feeding resources for Wigeon. Brent Goose foraging
   may also modify sediment characters to their own benefit. As Wigeon
   numbers continue to increase throughout Britain and because the Exe
   Estuary eons the only site in a series of 18 major coastal areas showing
   any inverse relationship between wintering Wigeon and Brent Geese in
   southern England, it is considered that any competitive interaction that
   may occur or may have occurred in the past has not stopped an increase
   in numbers at the national level.}},

Abstract = {{We studied disturbance factors that caused Event Geese along a stretch
   of the north Norfolk coast to fake flight. Patterns of activity and
   undisturbed flight were also quantified, to derive energy budgets. The
   most frequent source of disturbance tons pedestrians. Those disturbances
   resulting in greatest energy expenditure were also of human origin, but
   tended to be `mechanised' (e.g. aircraft, gunfire). Activity budgets for
   high- and low-disturbance days were compared, which showed that birds
   feed less and are more vigilant when disturbance is greater. On grass
   pastures, 68.9\% of flight was a response to disturbance, which
   increased estimated hourly energy expenditure (HEE) from 32.2 to 35.6
   J/h (10.8\%). On exceptionally disturbed days, HEE increased to more
   than 44.0 J/h. As a consequence of disturbance, geese may need to feed
   at night for up to an hour in mid-winter, to balance their daily energy
   budget. Unless they are able to feed easily at night, disturbance may be
   one of the primary factors influencing local distribution of Brent
   Geese. Management implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive performance of White-fronted Geese and Tundra Bean
   Geese was surveyed during 1964/65 to 1994/95 in southern Zeeland (the
   Netherlands). The proportion of first-year birds was higher on average
   in the White-front than in the Tundra Bean Goose (29 +/- 10\% and 25 +/-
   5\%) and mean brood-size was also higher (2.5 +/- 0.3 versus 2.1 +/-
   0.2). During the first five years of the survey, more than 15\% broods
   in both species were single-parent, this proportion dropped to 5-10\% in
   the course of the 1970s. No trend in time in reproductive parameters of
   either species was found. The proportion of first-year birds was
   significantly correlated with mean brood-site in both species. In the
   White-fronted Goose both parameters show a pattern of poor breeding
   every three years and the proportion of first-year birds is strongly
   correlated with those of the Dark-bellied Brent Goose. No cyclical
   variations were found in the Tundra Bean Goose, perhaps because its
   breeding range is more southerly than that of the White-front.}},

Abstract = {{Six sites around Borup Fiord, west central Ellesmere Island, Canada,
   were surveyed for breeding Knot Calidris canutus islandica. Breeding
   density at the main study site was estimated using a calculation based
   on hatching success, brood counts and the probability of broods being
   resighted: estimates from other sites were based on this assessment.
   Density at the main study site was 4.6 pairs/km(2), varying between 0.4
   and 12.7 pairs/km(2) in different areas. Density was negatively
   correlated with spring snow cover. At other sites density estimates
   ranged front nil to 5.7 pairs/km(2). Brood counts and registrations of
   territorial activity accounted for only 33\% and 67\% of pairs,
   respectively. A literature review suggested that within the Knot's
   breeding range, densities appear to be highest in areas showing a warm
   regional climate, early snow-melt, and high vegetational diversity and
   density. The Knot's dependence on such areas may be related to its sire
   and need for an early start to breeding. The total breeding population
   of C.c.islandica was estimated to be 61 000 pairs, or 304 000
   individuals in autumn. Over-optimistic estimates of breeding numbers and
   productivity, however, may mean that about half of the Knots wintering
   in Europe may not be C.c.islandica.}},

Abstract = {{Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are important prey for many small
   falcons, and the recent expansion of the breeding range of the Hobby
   into eastern England has been associated with an increased availability
   of dragonfly prey to juveniles. We have therefore measured the energy
   content and elemental composition of a range of common British
   dragonflies. Carbon and nitrogen contents were typical of aquatic
   invertebrates and did not vary with dragonfly size, whereas ash content
   was significantly reduced in larger species. The mean energy content of
   dragonfly tissue was 24.6 kJ/g (dry mass) and showed no significant
   variation between species. The energy content of an individual dragonfly
   ranged from 0.8 to 9.4 kJ for the species examined in this study. Data
   on the energy requirements of free-living falcons suggest that a
   juvenile Hobby in late summer could meet its daily energy requirement by
   capturing between 75 and 90 Migrant Hawker or 200 to 250 Common Darter
   dragonflies each day.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the sources of egg mass variation in the Pallid
   Swift, we weighed 142 eggs (0.1 mg accuracy) from 1990 to 1993 in a
   colony in north-west Italy. The observed variability was related to
   laying order and laying date, but was not influenced by the wing length
   or mass of the parents. Food abundance in the days preceding egg laying
   did affect egg mass, but the variation was small with respect to the
   average egg mass. As previously reported for the Common Swift, the last
   (third) Egg lain had the smallest mass. The heaviest Eggs were laid
   early in the season. As there is no seasonal decrease in aerial insect
   abundance, this trend may be because high quality parents lay earlier in
   the season. The mass of the egg positively influenced nestling weight at
   age 20 days. We have analysed to what extent egg mass per se affected
   chick survival.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the habitat preferences of 26 field-feeding bird
   species wintering on mixed, lowland farmland. Resampling methods were
   used to determine or each species whether the total number of birds
   recorded on each field type over the winter differed front that Expected
   if birds were distributed randomly. Grazed grass fields were generally
   preferred by invertebrate-feeding species and avoided by seed-enters.
   Ungrazed grass fields were used relatively more by seed-eating species,
   and less by invertebrate-feeders than grated fields. Cereal and oilseed
   stubbles were strongly preferred by seed-eating species, in some cases
   to the virtual exclusion of other field types. Winter cereals were
   almost universally avoided, although then was some evidence that a few
   species made more use of organic cereal fields than those tinder
   conventional management. These results are consistent with likely
   variations in invertebrate and seed food availability between field
   types, and suggest that a mixed farming landscape which combines stock
   grazing with an ni able regime that maintains some over-winter stubbles
   will support higher numbers and a higher species diversity of
   field-feeding birds than landscapes dominated by autumn-sown crops or
   pasture. Over-winter stubbles are Extremely important feeding habitats
   for seed-eating passerines. On set-aside land, regeneration of a
   vegetation cover from stubble is thus likely to yield much greater
   benefits for wintering seed-eating birds than sown grass covers.}},

Abstract = {{Clutch size in the Yellow Wagtail increases by about one egg per 19
   degrees of latitude throughout Europe, but at a given latitude larger
   clutches are laid in western than in eastern Europe. In eastern Asia
   there is evidence of a reverse latitudinal dine, in which clutch size is
   smaller at higher latitudes, and considerably smaller than in Europe at
   equivalent latitudes. These trends suggest that smaller clutches are
   laid by populations with access to extensive wintering areas in east
   Africa and south-east Asia, whereas larger clutches are laid by
   populations with more restricted wintering areas in west Africa and
   India. Higher winter mortality in the latter populations may reduce
   breeding density, leading to less competition for resources and allowing
   larger clutches to be produced.}},

Abstract = {{Within the breeding population of a deciduous woodland, male Wrens
   averaged slightly larger than females in wing length, foot length, head
   plus bill length and body mass. First-year and older birds were similar
   for three of these morphometric variables, but the first-year group were
   shorter-winged than the older birds (by 3\%). Despite this, wing length
   still proved to be a useful discriminator of sex when the data were
   pooled for all ages (74\% of males exceeding the maximum female value of
   49.8 mm). A discriminant function utilizing wing length and head plus
   bill length correctly sexed 96\% of individuals in the sample from which
   it was derived (n = 49 males, 36 females). This function was converted
   into a predictive equation for the probability of an unknown case being
   male, and a plot of wing length against head plus bill length along with
   probability contours which enabled the sexing of unknown cases without
   the need for calculations. Measurements of the morphological variables
   investigated were found to be highly repeatable for a single worker,
   with the exception of body mass which differed substantially between the
   sexes but which was only moderately repeatable. The methods provided
   should prove valuable for sexing British mainland Troglodytes
   troglodytes indigenus, and probably also Western European T. t.
   troglodytes, but should nor be applied to the larger, offshore island
   races.}},

   breeding area in northernmost Finland during the years 1982-1994. The
   mean clutch size was higher than in move southern populations. Losses
   during the egg and nestling stages were negligible: hatching success
   (hatchlings per egg) and fledging success (fledglings per hatchling)
   were 0.91 and 0.89, respectively. Only heavy rainfall decreased nestling
   survival. Our results show that population size is stable and breeding
   success is good in this marginal breeding area compared to other
   breeding grounds. The population size fluctuated in parallel with the
   vole cycle as expected if small (mammal) predators switch to taking
   birds when vole numbers are low.}},

Abstract = {{Sedge Warbler breeding was studied at a site in Greater Manchester, UK,
   during 1991 and 1993. Birds were individually colour-ringed and, in the
   2 years of the study, 18 pairs and 38 nesting attempts were observed. In
   both years, the majority of pairs (> 90\%) attempted a second brood
   after successfully raising their first. Overall nest survival was 44\%
   and the median reproductive output of individual males was 6.5
   fledglings in each year (range 0-10 and 0-15 in 1991 and 1993,
   respectively). After fledging, one or both parents continued to feed the
   young for up to 15 days (median 11, range 0-15 days). One male was
   apparently bigamous in 1991 and in 1993, raising four broods
   successfully in 1993 and 25 fledglings over the 2 years. These
   observations suggest that double brooding is the normal strategy for
   Sedge Warblers in this population and that polygyny may be common,
   although easily overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrograms of calls given by Carrion and Hooded Crows in the Italian
   Alpine hybrid zone have been tested for differences between the two
   subspecies by univariate and multivariate techniques. Vocalizations of
   the the Crows are similar and composed of 2-15 caws, each usually made
   lip of two harmonics, separated by short intervals. However, one-way
   ANOVA and discriminant analysis showed that they were differentiated
   with respect both to temporal and frequency parameters. WE suggest that
   differences in vocalizations reflect mostly the phylogenetic divergence
   between Hooded and Carrion Crows. The results are in keeping with
   previous ecological, morphological and molecular data and would confirm
   that the present designation of the two Crows as distinct subspecies is
   correct. Differences in vocalizations, together with others regarding
   ecology and behaviour, may result in assortative mating and homotypic
   flocking and, therefore, may contribute to reinforcement of the
   reproductive isolation between the Carrion and the Hooded Crow in the
   Alpine hybrid tone.}},

Abstract = {{Crested Tits at Abernethy Forest RSPB nature reserve selected broad
   stumps and dead trees of Scots Pine in which they excavated nest
   chambers in the rotten sapwood of the trunks. Given the size
   requirements for nest chambers, only frees with a diameter greater than
   about 20 cm are suitable, as sapwood depth is correlated with trunk
   diameter. There was avoidance of the south-west quadrant of dead trees
   and stumps, despite the greater depth of soft sapwood on the west side
   of dead trees. Prevailing weather or sunlight may affect aspect
   selection. Nests occurred in old open forest and plantations where the
   density of the surrounding frees averaged 290 per ha. Mean clutch size
   was 5.5 eggs and nest success was 50\%. The provision of potential nest
   sites by cutting `high' stumps has shown that it takes about nine years
   for the sapwood to rot sufficiently for excavation. However, none has
   been used to date, perhaps because of the small trunk diameters. It is
   recommended that future stumps should be cut at least 2 m from the
   ground and have a trunk diameter of over 30 cm.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of breeding Ospreys Pandion haliaetus on Corsica (Western
   Mediterranean) has been studied by identifying fish remains collected at
   nests between 1983 and 1992. Twelve species of fish have been
   identified, of which mullets (4 species) made up to 73\% of the
   identified prey remains. Other major identified prey were bream (2
   species) and Saupe. The mean lengths of mullet were estimated as 297 mm
   and mean weight as 235 g, whereas the bream were larger The fish
   identified in the diet remains are the most abundant species in this
   area of Corsica, and live near the surface; they are also mainly
   resident species. We suggest that they thus make predictable year-round
   prey for resident Osprey in Corsica.}},

Abstract = {{The Constant Effort Sites (CES) Ringing Scheme of the British Trust for
   Ornithology aims to provide annual measures of change in the abundance
   and productivity of common breeding passerines in scrub and wetland
   habitats in Britain and Ireland. Changes in the sizes of the annual
   catches, from a set of standard mist nets operated during 12 summer
   (May-August) visits, are combined across sites to produce estimates of
   the percentage change in adult and juvenile numbers. The proportion of
   juveniles in the catch is used as a relative measure of breeding
   productivity. Methods are presented for calculating standard errors of
   between-year changes in both adult and juvenile catches, and changes in
   the proportion of juveniles. Present levels of precision are summarized
   and predictions are made concerning likely improvements in precision
   from a larger CES Scheme. For most of the species considered there was
   little evidence that between-year changes in catches of adults at CE
   sites have differed between habitats, regions or according to coastal
   proximity. For several species there was evidence of consistently higher
   percentages of juvenile birds being captured at sires in wet habitats
   (mainly reedbeds and wet scrub) compared to sites in dry habitats (dry
   scrub and woodland). However, between-year changes in the percentage of
   juveniles caught were generally homogeneous across habitats and regions.
   There was some evidence that between-year changes in catches of
   Whitethroats Sylvia communis and Bullfinches Pyrrhula pyrrhula differed
   between coastal and inland sites. Implications of these findings for
   future analyses and interpretation of results from the CES Scheme are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-163}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to earlier accounts, this paper suggests that both first-year
   and adult Penduline Tits undertake a partial prenuptial moult. This
   moult is more extensive in first-year birds than adults and includes the
   replacement of body feathers, marginal and median wing coverts and a
   variable number of greater coverts, rectrices and inner remiges. Most
   flight feathers and greater coverts renewed during the first prenuptial
   moult are probably replaced from the point that the previous
   post-juvenile moult had finished and the subsequent moult occurs
   sequentially. This complementarity between post-juvenile and prenuptial
   partial moult seems exceptional among European passerines. Males tend to
   renew more of their plumage between the summer and winter moult periods.
   The extent of the first prenuptial moult was negatively correlated with
   the extent of the previous post-juvenile moult. It is suggested that
   this is due to the small advantages provided by a more extensive
   prenuptial moult after a given level of plumage improvement has been
   attained. Linked to this relationship, the advantages of undergoing a
   more extensive post-juvenile moult are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Parental attendance was studied in 1991 in the Cap Sizun Kittiwake
   colonies (Brittany, France). After a period of continuous guarding
   lasting on average 22 days, parents left their chicks unattended.
   Thereafter, parental attendance decreased regularly until fledging. The
   chick age when first left alone was on average 3 days lower for large
   broods than for single-chick broods. Moreover, whatever the brood size,
   chicks from late nests were younger when left unattended. Parental age
   affected the initiation of first absence. Younger parents reduced their
   attendance sooner than older parents. About 80\% of the nests with
   chicks were visited by other adults at least once during the absence of
   the parents, and 50\% were visited in the 3 days following the first
   absence of the breeders. These squatters were mainly failed breeders and
   prebreeders looking for a future breeding site. The results are
   discussed in terms of costs and benefits of chick neglect and
   comparisons were made with data from other studies in North Atlantic and
   Alaskan colonies. This reflected the flexibility of adult behaviour in
   relation to brood size and food availability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the 1986 Woodlark survey - the only national
   survey of the species conducted to date - and reviews subsequent changes
   in British Woodlark populations. In 1986, the British population was
   approximately 250 pairs concentrated in 5 regions: south-west England,
   New Forest/Dorset, Hampshire/Surrey border, Breckland and the Suffolk
   coast. Habitat occupancy in 1986 differed between regions. Most
   Woodlarks were found in young conifer plantations and heathland, but
   neither of these habitats was important in the south-west where birds
   used a variety of habitats including marginal farmland. A higher
   proportion of birds used conifer plantations in East Anglia than in New
   Forest/Dorset and on the Hampshire/Surrey border (this difference
   probably reflects availability of suitable habitat). The ground
   vegetation of Woodlark territories differed between regions, but
   territories typically contained bare soil or short grass and generally <
   20\% shrub cover. Since 1986, there has been a marked increase in the
   British Woodlark population and by 1993 the population probably exceeded
   600 pairs. Numbers appear to have increased in all regions except the
   south-west but the fastest increase has been in East Anglia where
   numbers have risen both in conifer forest and heathland. On the Suffolk
   coast, substantial numbers now occupy bath forest and heath, but in
   Breckland the majority remain associated with forestry. An increase in
   availability of suitable habitat (through storm damage in forests,
   restocking of forests and heathland management) and a recent run of mild
   winters have probably contributed to the recovery. However, in the
   Breckland forests numbers continue to rise despite a decreasing area of
   suitable habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The species composition, relative abundance and vegetation community
   associations of a wintering passerine assemblage were studied on 7 sites
   in north Norfolk between 1989 and 1994. A total of 20 species was
   recorded including coastal specialists as well as habitat generalists;
   relative abundance varied greatly from Chaffinch and Great Tit with
   single records, to Twite and Skylark with many hundreds. Most species
   showed strong association with, and aversion to, particular vegetation
   community types, but the relationships with vegetation communities
   varied between species. The communities with the higher bird densities
   were Limonium, Suaeda vera and Suaeda/Salicornia saltmarshes. Amongst
   the least used vegetation communities were Halimione saltmarsh and
   mobile dunes. There was little evidence of any seasonal change in
   habitat associations. The findings are discussed both in terms of
   vegetation community availability in north Norfolk and in the wider
   context of coastal zone planning and the threats and opportunities open
   to wintering passerines by differing responses to sea-level rise in
   eastern England.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to describe the songbird communities occupying
   willow and poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) crops during the breeding
   season, and to identify the features of existing plantations that affect
   their abundance. Songbird point-counts were undertaken at 66 different
   plots of SRC at 29 sites throughout Britain and Ireland during spring
   1993. Measures of vegetation and coppice management in each plot were
   also taken. The songbird species using the SRC survey plots were similar
   to those reported from traditional coppice habitats. Willow SRC
   contained move resident and migrant songbird species than poplar SRC.
   Warbler species and buntings in particular were rarely recorded from
   poplar plots. Finches, tits and thrushes were recorded equally from both
   willow and poplar. More migrant species were recorded from year 2 willow
   coppice (i.e. in its third growth season since winter cutting) than in
   either year I or year 3. Most resident species selected older willow or
   poplar coppice growth up to year 3 or 4, the oldest age classes in the
   sample. These 4-year trends for migrant and resident songbirds are
   similar to those observed in traditional coppice woodland over a 10- or
   12-year rotation. Skylark and Meadow Pipit were recorded from recently
   cut SRC plots (year 0). In a regression analysis, the number of songbird
   species and individuals, particularly migrants, were found to be
   positively related to the increased structural density or complexity of
   the coppice vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of singing male Corncrakes are often used to estimate population

   of the breeding season male Corncrakes sing almost continuously at

   in the wild. During radio-tracking studies, male Corncrakes were found
   to be singing on 92\% of night-time checks when they appeared nor to
   have been accompanied by a female during the preceding day, but males
   accompanied by a female on the preceding day were only recorded singing
   on 12\% of checks. Males were always silent when accompanied at night by
   a radio-tagged female. Wind speed and rainfall had no significant effect
   on the chance of it male being recorded singing. These findings suggest
   that surveillance of nocturnal song production could be used as a
   non-intrusive method of assessing whether male Corncrakes are attracting
   mates.}},

Abstract = {{The main species involved in a wreck of seabirds along the east coast of
   Britain in February-March 1994 were Guillemot Uria aalge (20-50 000
   corpses) and Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (3-5000 corpses). The wreck
   was caused by a long period of onshore winds and, possibly, a shortage
   of food. On the Isle of May the start of breeding in the Guillemot was
   delayed by 5-10 days but the wreck had no determinable effect on the
   survival of adults or immatures, colony counts or breeding success.
   There was a high mortality among adult Shags and only 13\% of 150
   colour-ringed individuals alive in 1993 returned in 1994. This return
   rate was far lower than that recorded during the last 30 years
   (75-82\%). None of the missing birds returned in 1995 and most are
   presumed dead. The start of breeding was delayed and the dare of the
   first egg was 51 days later than that predicted from a usually reliable
   equation linking laying date with wind and Herring stocks, but median
   laying date, breeding success and growth of chicks were all well within
   the normal range. The Isle of May population crashed to its lowest level
   for 35 years and, unless there is substantial immigration, it will take
   10 years for it to recover.}},

Abstract = {{The object of the research reported here teas to produce a map of
   habitat quality for the Dunlin across the Flow Country of northern
   Scotland for use in conservation and land-use planning. The region is
   too large (ca. 1800 km(2)) to survey on foot without significant
   expenditure of time and resources. Habitat quality was therefore
   predicted by relating Dunlin density recorded on a set of sample sites
   in the region to vegetation and landform characteristics. Density was
   then extrapolated across the whole region based on the recurrence of
   similar habitat conditions. The abundance of Dunlin in the Flow Country
   is shown to be related to several different classes of environmental
   variation. Dunlin are absent from several easily delimited types of
   habitat (e.g. lochs and woodland). A presence/absence map of habitat
   quality for the species is achieved simply by mapping these habitat
   features. Abundance on the moorland that remains is related to
   vegetation characteristics and the presence of clusters of pools
   (pool-systems). Dunlin prefer areas of moorland with shout, sparse
   vegetation. However, within such sites, regardless of vegetation type,
   Dunlin density varies systematically with respect to pool-systems,
   increasing exponentially as these habitat features are approached.
   Density variation with respect to changes in vegetation characteristics
   and pool-systems were modelled to produce a map of habitat qualify
   within a I ha grid over the whole region.}},

   British Greenfinches. Significantly more females than males make such
   movements. Outward movement begins by early November and continues until
   at least late January. The return movement can last from January to May
   and is particularly rapid in March and early April. The directions of
   the outward movements are widely dispersed but show trends towards the
   south and, except in western areas, towards the west. In Britain south
   of latitude 54 degrees N the proportion of birds leaving their breeding
   grounds in winter increases from west to east, being negligible in the
   south-west and largest in East Anglia, but relatively small near the
   south coast. Distances moved show a similar dependence. The numbers
   making seasonal movements in a given year are correlated with the
   breeding population, particularly in south-east England.}},

Abstract = {{Birds make up a trivial proportion of species on earth. Yet they are
   extremely important, simply because there are so few species of birds
   and we know so much about so many of them. This rich source of
   information can be used to develop and test general theories about the
   distribution and abundance of organisms, important both for ecologists
   and conservationists. This paper examines the relationship between local
   population abundance and the size of species' geographic ranges,
   textures of population abundance within ranges, and what happens at the
   edges of species' geographic distributions. Implications for
   conservation are emphasized. Within the highly modified landscape of
   Britain, birds are apparently not good indicators of species-rich sites
   of high conservation importance for other taxa, but in many other ways
   are perfect `model organisms' for monitoring and understanding human
   impacts on ecological systems. The biggest threat to all species over
   the next century is human-induced global environmental change; bird
   populations are, and will increasingly be, of crucial importance both
   for monitoring and for designing policies to deal with global change.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of Golden Eagles was carried out in 1992 which, as far as
   possible, repeated that of 1982-83. In total, 422 pairs were located,
   0.5\% fewer than in 1982-83. However, changes between 1982-83 and 1992
   in the number of pairs in 7 geographical regions varied between a 27\%
   decline (from 22 pairs to 16) and a 28\% increase (from 53 pairs to 68).
   The mean number of young reared per pair in 1992 was 0.32. There was no
   significant variation in breeding success among regions. Breeding
   success was lower in 1992 than in 1982 in 6 of the 7 regions. The
   proportion of IO-km National Grid squares which held pairs of Golden

   growth has been highest in the Magpie and Carrrion Grow although both
   these have shown a reduction in the rate of growth from the late 1970s.
   Densities of all 4 corvids have increased on farmland, whereas only
   Magpie and Carrion Crow have increased in woodland. Population trends
   were associated with farmland type in all the corvids; the strongest
   increases were on mixed and grazing farms and the smallest on arable
   farms. There were strong regional differences in trends within woodland
   and farmland. Our results are discussed in the context of the long-term
   changes in corvid populations that have been reported since the start of

Abstract = {{The number of Girl Bunting Emberiza cirlus breeding pairs was recorded
   from 1976 to 1993 in orange plantations in eastern Spain, and some
   aspects of the breeding ecology of this species were studied from 1989
   to 1993. Breeding densities varied from 0.6 to 10.1 pairs per 10 ha,
   being highest during the last 5 years. Breeding density each year was
   positively correlated with rainfall during the previous December-March
   period, but not to winter temperatures. The mean laying date was 17
   April, and between-year variation was almost entirely determined (97\%
   of the variation) by rainfall during December-March. The last clutches
   were laid by early JuIy. Mean clutch size was 3.5 eggs. Clutch size
   increased during the first part of the season and then declined. About
   half of the nests were successful and half of the eggs laid produced
   fledglings. Predation accounted for most (35\%) of the individual losses
   and was heavier early in the season. A logistic model was fitted to the
   weight data of the nestlings. Growth rate was 0.58 g day(-1) g(-1) and
   asymptotic weight was 15.6 g, which is about 65\% of the adult weight.
   We suggest that the increase of the breeding population during the last
   years is related to the increase in winter rainfall, probably increasing
   food supply.}},

   birds showed that the extent of moult in the Great Tit is
   photoperiodically controlled. Autumn short-light days reduce the extent
   of moult. The data from moulting birds trapped in the wild agreed with
   experimental results and revealed that the timing of feather replacement
   influenced the individual extent of moult. Annual variation in the
   extent of moult was influenced by the timing of breeding in the
   population. A possible explanation for the decline in the extent of
   moult during migration is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With an average peak of approximately 12 000 birds between 1987 and 1991
   the Wash is the most important British estuary for Bar-tailed Godwits,
   holding 10\% of the fetal European population. This paper describes the
   biometrics, wing moult and movements of approximately 3500 Bar-tailed
   Godwits caught on the Wash between 1960 and 1990 and relates this to the
   BTO's Birds of Estuaries Enquiry (BoEE) counts and other published
   information. Numbers of Bar-tailed Godwits counted on the Wash increased
   through the period 1970-90, increases being most apparent in the times
   of peak passage in October and February. In recent years approximately
   8000 birds have moulted on the Wash, second-year birds starting in the
   first week in June and adults in the third week of July. The population
   takes 100-120 days to complete primary moult. Analysis of biometrics
   suggests that the majority of the moulting population on the Wash comes
   from breeding populations in northern Europe and Scandinavia, although
   small numbers of non-moulting birds, breeding further east, pass through
   in late August and early September. The data collected by the Wash Wader
   Ringing Group and the BoEE show that the Wash is one of the most
   important areas in Britain and Europe for the Scandinavian and west
   European breeding populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991-1993 we studied the body mass change of adult Common Terns
   Sterna hirundo breeding on the German North Sea coast. In each year
   females' body mass increase prior to laying was very similar (about 5.4
   g day(-1)). This mass increase resulted in an average body mass of about
   175 g on the day of egg-laying. In 1992 and 1993 the females' body mass
   decreased significantly during incubation, while males' body mass was
   constant. In 1991, however, neither sex showed a decrease in body mass
   while incubating. In all years, incubating females and males were
   heavier than chick-rearing parents. This difference was not caused by
   higher mass in early incubation, because males and females were still
   significantly heavier in the last week of incubation than in the first
   week of chick-rearing. Decreasing mass during incubation and the low
   body masses during chick-rearing are considerd to be stress induced
   rather than an adaptive strategy to lower flight costs. The decrease in
   female body mass during incubation in 1992 and 1993 and the lower body
   mass of males in these years could be related to less favourable
   foraging conditions compared to 1991, when both males and females showed
   the highest average body mass values of the 3 years.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have addressed the breeding ecology of the Kingfisher,
   especially in Britain. The fish diet of Kingfishers was studied from 3
   watersheds in the New Forest, Hampshire using analysis of regurgitated
   prey remains collected from nest tunnels and chambers. Diagnostic bones
   from each of 5 prey species were selected to identify prey species
   represented in the remains. From reference material, linear dimensions
   of the bone selected for recognition in each prey species were related
   to fish total length; dietary reconstructions from prey remains could
   thus estimate prey size structure as well as species frequency. Over 850
   bones were recovered from 7 nest sites in which 20 broods were reared
   during 1989. Minnow was the most frequent prey with smaller numbers of
   the remaining species consumed. The choice of prey species was similar
   across different nest sites at the same watershed and also between first
   and second broods reared at the same nest site. Different fish species
   were taken at different watersheds, perhaps reflecting local variation
   in fish population structures. At all nest sires studied, size of prey
   appeared to be the main factor determining prey selection, with Minnows,
   Bullheads and Trout between 40 mm and 70 mm in total length being
   favoured.}},

   the assumption that higher altitudes are less favourable for this
   species as population densities generally increased with altitude.
   Moreover, altitudinal segregation of territorial males by age would not
   fit with our knowledge of population dynamics and social strategies of
   the species. Reported differences in the altitudinal distribution of

Abstract = {{The Dipper population of the Esk river system, Lothian, Scotland, has
   been surveyed at intervals over a period of 60 years up to the present
   day with detailed population surveys and studies of breeding biology
   faking place between 1979 and 1991. Although the population has
   fluctuated up to 6-fold, there is no evidence of any consistent trend in
   population size. Currently, maximum breeding densities are higher than
   in most other studied Dipper populations. The breeding season begins
   significantly Inter than in populations further south and west in the
   British Isles, but clutch and brood sizes and the incidence of second
   broods are all typical of other British and European populations.
   Unusually in comparison with other studies in Britain and Ireland, there
   is no evidence of any significant decline in clutch and brood sizes
   towards the end of the breeding season. Although clutch size did not
   differ with the age of parents, breeding success of adult pairs was
   higher than that of pairs with at least I first-year bird, suggesting an
   improvement in parental care with experience. The high frequency of
   polygyny in this study population is unprecedented for this species.
   Polygynous male Dippers enjoyed higher breeding success than monogamous
   males. The breeding success of primary females was not significantly
   different from that of monogamous females, but secondary and tertiary
   females suffered a 25\% reduction in brood size which was probably a
   consequence of reduced parental assistance from the male. The incidence
   of polygyny varies greatly both within and between populations. Further
   work is needed to understand the factors controlling variation in mating
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses intra- and interspecific facultative nest parasitism
   of shrubsteppe passerines on the Iberian peninsula through 4 seasons,
   from 1991-94. Daily frequency of nest parasitism teas very low (f = 3.9
   x 10(-3) during laying and f = 2.8 x 10(-4) during incubation).
   Observation of the 3 examples found in the field of 2 intraspecific and
   one interspecific instances revealed that the eggs were accepted and, in
   the latter case, that the parasitic chick was viable. The experimental
   tests in the field of placing I additional egg that was similar to (n =
   57) or clearly different from the host (n = 50), in order to simulate
   both intra and interspecific parasitism revealed: (i) higher rejection
   rates in areas with higher risk of predation and (ii) similar rejection
   rates for both types of eggs. The experimental addition of nestlings of
   other species (n = 6) revealed that in 67\% of the cases studied, the
   parasitic chick had a normal growth rate. It is suggested that nest
   parasitism among these species is an occasional behaviour pattern,
   caused by high nest predation rates in Iberian shrubsteppe habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Annual surveys of breeding Stone Curlews at the Chemical and Biological
   Defence Establishment at Porton Down between 1987 and 1994 indicate that
   it is an important site for the species, having held up to 12\% of the
   national breeding population. However, the population and the proportion
   of pairs nesting on chalk grassland declined between 1992 and 1994 after
   an increase since 1988. A comparison of measurements of sward height in
   1989 and 1994 indicates that sward height had increased at breeding
   sites on seminatural chalk grassland which were used when the number of
   pairs nesting on downland was increasing. The sites with the smallest
   increases in sward height were those at which Stone Curlews continued to
   nest. The changes in vegetation are believed to be attributable to
   increased rainfall and lower densities of Rabbits. The implications of
   the results for conservation and management are discussed.}},

   arrival. Fifteen species arrived noticeably earlier in the 1940s, a
   period of warm springs, while several species showed earlier arrivals in
   the 1980s. A number of species showed later arrival dates in the 1960s
   and 1970s, when April temperatures were colder than average. Several
   species showed significant correlations between arrival date and

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a survey of breeding Corn Buntings in
   Britain in 1993. Numbers of Corn Buntings and land-use types and field
   boundaries present were recorded by volunteers from over 1300 tetrads
   selected across the range of the species in Britain. The British
   breeding population was estimated at around 20 000 territories.
   Bootstrapped 95\% confidence limits differed from the calculated
   estimates by approximately 20\%. Population sizes in different regions
   of Britain were positively correlated with the proportion of total
   farmland under tillage and cereals and with the total areas of tillage
   and cereals, but not with the proportion of tillage made up by cereals
   nor with the overall area of farmland. Densities in occupied IO-km
   squares were lower in regions which experienced the greatest declines in
   distribution between 1968-72 and 1988-92. Areas abandoned by breeding
   birds between 1968-72 and 1988-91 were higher in altitude and held more
   grassland and less tilled land than areas where birds were retained.
   Areas which gained breeding birds during the same period contained more
   filled land than areas where the species was not recorded as breeding in
   either Breeding Atlas. Tilled land of all types was more widespread in
   tetrads which held Corn Buntings than in those where no birds were
   recorded. Ten-kilometre squares which retained breeding Corn Buntings
   between the 2 Breeding Atlas periods and those which lost them both
   showed an increase in their average area of cereals and total tillage
   between 1969 and 1988, but 10-km squares which retained breeding birds
   held around twice the area of both land-use types in both years. The
   results suggest that changes in cereal area are unlikely to be the main
   cause of recent population declines. The possibility of a `source-sink'
   metapopulation basis to the distribution of Corn Buntings in Britain,
   and the practical conservation implications of this possibility, are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses Common Birds Census (CBC) data to examine habitat
   selection by Corn Buntings and the relationship between population
   change and land-use change at the scale of the individual farm. On each
   of 29 farms, structural data and cropping patterns in the year of peak
   Corn Bunting population size were compared with those in the year of
   lowest population size (or first year of extinction). Crop diversity,
   hedgerow length, field size and the areas of all crops except wheat and
   barley did not differ significantly between years of highest and lowest
   Corn Bunting population. Barley was more extensive in years of highest
   Corn Bunting population and wheat move extensive in years of lowest
   population. Variation in Corn Bunting population density in a sample of
   18 farms censused in 1974 could not be explained by variations in
   habitat diversity, hedgerow length, field size, altitude or the area of
   different crop types. This variation was also unrelated to either of the
   first 2 components of an ordination of structural and crop data.
   Population size was also examined in relation to cropping changes over
   periods of between 10 and 30 years on 10 individual farms. Changes in
   the numbers of Corn Bunting territories on individual farms surveyed
   over long periods were also poorly correlated with changes in cropping.
   On these farms, Corn Buntings exhibited no preference between barley and
   wheat and none between spring- and winter-sown cereals. Cereals were
   preferred to grassland, and temporary grassland was preferred to
   permanent pasture. We suggest that Corn Bunting numbers are unlikely to
   have declined as a result of decreased crop diversity, of changes in the
   relative areas of tillage or grassland or of the loss of hedgerows, and
   that more likely causes are reduced winter food supplies resulting
   particularly from the loss of spring tillage, increased pesticide usage
   and improved harvesting and storage techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We describe for the first time the breeding biology and survival of the
   Alpine Chough Pyrrhocorax graculus in different European massifs (Alps
   and West-Balkan). When all data were pooled, mean clutch and brood sizes
   were 3.6 eggs (se = 0.1) and 2.6 chicks (se = 0.1), respectively.
   Fledging success per pair varied between 1 and 4 fledged young per pair
   (mean 1.9). Survival of the Alpine Chough was estimated with a
   cupture-resighting model using a colour-ringed population (n = 315
   adults) which used human food sources. Adult survival rate varied from
   83 to 92\%, depending on the flock. This difference could be a
   consequence of differences in flock composition. No significant
   difference was detected between male and female survival. Survival of
   first-year birds (77\%) was lower than that of adults. In order to
   analyse the effect of human food supplied by tourist activities,
   breeding success land flock structure were compared between 2 alpine
   populations which either did or did not exploit human food supplied by
   tourist activities. No difference was found in breeding success or flock
   composition between the 2 populations.}},

Abstract = {{The social organization and territoriality of a colour-ringed population
   of Black Redstarts Phoenicurus ochrurus was studied in a mountain area
   of southern Spain during 4 winters. A total of 28 adult males and 112
   grey birds (females and juvenile males) was colour-ringed, These showed
   it complex territorial system: 5 adult males defended stable
   territories, 6 adult males and 1 grey bird temporarily defended
   different territories throughout the winter while most of the birds were
   non-territorial. Grey birds were observed less frequently than adult
   males in the area. Territorial and non-territorial birds seemed to be
   resident in the area; many being recorded after 40 days during the same
   winter. Territoriality was correlated with plumage and body size.
   However, size was age-dependent but within the group of adult males,
   there was Mo difference in either size, body mass or fat score
   suggesting no short-term benefits of being territorial. However, the
   survival rate seems to be higher for adult males than for grey birds
   according to the control of ringed birds in a subsequent winter. It is
   suggested that territoriality in adult males is a consequence of
   competition for certain resources (food or shelter areas) and this might
   affect the survival of different categories of birds.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for feathers as a nest-building material was investigated by
   placing feather patches in woodland and garden sites between January and
   June 1993 and March and April 1994. The first of 18 species to breed in
   the area which use feathers in their nests was the Long-tailed Tit. The
   feather requirements of this species are known to far exceed that of the
   other species. Long-tailed Tits were shown to forage actively for
   feathers up to 115 m from the nest but possibly not as far as 200 m.
   Patches generally remained untouched during the 24-h exposure but when
   detected were typically heavily exploited. Complete disappearance of
   feather patches occurred sporadically right to the end of the study.
   The woodland contained only a low standing crop of moulted feathers and
   it is concluded that natural feather patches resulting from kills are
   important for birds who need this nest material. If is suggested that
   Long-tailed Tits may be attempting to avoid competition far feathers by
   nesting early.}},

Abstract = {{The view on how rapidly morphological, physiological, and behavioural
   traits may change as a result of microevolutionary processes (i.e.
   genetic variation and directional selection) has changed considerably in
   the recent past. Observations on selection of morphological traits in
   Darwin's Finches on the Galapagos Islands and results of a 2-way
   selection experiment on migratory behaviour of Blackcaps Sylvia
   atricapilla have indicated that substantial changes can occur within
   short periods. A striking case is represented by Blackcaps breeding in
   continental Europe. Within the past 30 years, a subpopulation has
   developed a `new' migratory direction to the WNW to novel wintering
   areas on the British Isles. Experimental analysis of migratory
   orientation behaviour has demonstrated that behavioural changes can
   result from microevolutionary processes. Similar microevolutionary
   processes are likely to occur commonly, as both recent field
   observations and experimental results suggest. One outcome of this,
   which is of particular interest, involves the effects of continued
   global warming. Global warning is likely to favour obligate partial and
   short-distance migrants at higher latitudes and to be disadvantageous to
   long-distance migrants, and may lead to further reduction of species
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{This study used the results of a systematic upland bird survey conducted
   in 1990 and the information held on BTO nest record cards to study the
   distribution, numbers and breeding ecology of Twite Acanthis
   flavirostris in the south Pennines of England. The survey estimated the
   size of the population as between 200 and 400 pairs. The distribution of
   records obtained during the survey is mapped. In the breeding season,
   Twite show an association with relatively low-altitude sites at the
   moorland edge, especially where the length of reservoir or river shore
   tends to be large and the sward height exceeds 5 cm. They apparently
   avoid areas dominated by Juncus spp. flush vegetation. We compare
   information available on BTO nest record cards for south Pennines Twite
   with those from Scotland. Breeding performance for Twite nesting in
   heather-dominated habitats was better than for those nesting on either
   grass-dominated or other moorland habitat. Twite brood-size in the south
   Pennines has declined in recent years and nest failure rates have
   apparently increased. This may indicate that, through reduced
   recruitment, a decline in the size of the breeding population is likely.
   Current upland management practices may not be ideal for maintaining
   breeding Twite in Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of shooting bag records suggest a 90-93\% decrease in numbers
   of Black Grouse shot in Scotland and northern England since 1900. The
   magnitude of the decline differed between regions; the most severe
   declines were found in western Scotland, where the highest numbers of
   birds were once shot, but where fewest are shot today. By contrast,
   numbers shot in eastern Scotland (Perthshire and Angus) have declined
   relatively little and this region is currently the stronghold for Black
   Grouse in Britain. Overall, numbers shot in Scotland and northern
   England have changed little over the last 40 years, but as only 25\% of
   estates now shoot Black Grouse, shooting bags may no longer provide an
   accurate index of population trends.
   Responses from a questionnaire survey and from spring counts of males
   attending leks support the decline trends inferred from shooting
   records, with fewer estates in western Scotland having Black Grouse, and
   those that had reporting declining populations more frequently and male
   densities fourfold lower than in parts of eastern Scotland. The current
   British population was estimated at a little over 25 000 displaying
   males in spring.}},

Abstract = {{Daily gull movements between feeding and roosting sites may present a
   major hazard to aircraft. One option to avoid this problem is to deter
   gulls from using certain favoured roosting sites. This may be difficult
   as the gulls usually roost on water. We assessed whether a large gull
   roost, at a reservoir near Oxford, UK, could be moved by using taped
   distress calls and pyrotechnics without causing significant disturbance
   to wintering wildfowl. Gull movements were monitored during 3 deterrence
   trials by making weekly counts at several sites. These were compared
   with seasonal trends in gull numbers at a roost beyond the influence of
   these operations. Observations and counts were used to investigate the
   effects on wildfowl. These standard deterrence techniques prevented
   roost formation so long as an alternative roost site was available; they
   failed when alternative sites were frozen. Hence the pattern of gull
   movements in the area was considerably altered by their denial from this
   important roost. Gull roost deterrence caused no detectable reduction in
   numbers of any other species, either at the reservoir or in the Oxford
   area as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 70 years Short-eared Owls have exploited the high vole
   numbers associated with the early stages of large afforestation
   programmes in northern Britain. As a result, both breeding distribution
   and population size have expanded. Note that many forests are maturing,
   this improved status may be under threat unless the owls can use new
   patches of young forest, created by a replanting programme. This paper
   describes the breeding distribution of Short-eared Owls in a large
   forest with a diverse age structure. Patches of new forest fended to be
   larger than replanted patches. In the first rotation, forests supported
   breeding owls for 12 years after planting; peak densities occurred at
   3-7 years, and the age of the trees was the best predictor of owl
   numbers. Some patches of second-rotation forest also supported breeding
   owls, and the size of the patch was an important factor in determining
   whether it was used; the smallest occupied patch was 62 ha. Short-eared
   owls can continue to breed in replanted forests, provided that some
   restocked patches exceed a minimum threshold size.}},

Abstract = {{The diet and breeding density of 19 pairs of Common Buzzard Buteo buteo
   were studied in relation to indices of lagomorph and vole abundance
   during June-July 1993 in a range of habitats in southern Scotland.
   Lagomorphs, voles and birds formed over 70\% of the food items analysed
   from prey remains and pellets collected at nest sites. Indices of prey
   abundance differed significantly between habitat types. The percentage
   of lagomorph in Buzzard diet in different localities was significantly
   correlated with the index of lagomorph abundance; no such correlation
   was found between the percentage of vole in Buzzard diet and an index of
   vole abundance. The mean nearest-neighbour distance between Buzzard
   nests was 1.9 km. There was a significant negative correlation between
   nearest-neighbour distance and lagomorph abundance. It appears that
   lagomorphs were the primary prey which influenced the diet and breeding
   density of Buzzards in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of Peregrines in the breeding season of 1991 gave an estimated
   total of 1283 pairs occupying known nesting territories in Britain and
   Northern Ireland. 1214 territories were found occupied, 53 try
   apparently singles birds, and 141 known territories (9\%) were not
   visited. Overall territory occupancy was 83\%. The figure of 1283 pairs
   represents 147\% of the overall population level believed to exist in
   1930-39, and 167\% of that counted during the previous national survey,
   in 1981. The net increase was geographically uneven, being greatest in a
   broad zone from the eastern Grampians to South Wales, whereas numbers
   were still well below pre-war level in coastal south-east England. In
   coastal and western inland areas of the northern Highlands, numbers have
   declined since 1981. Throughout the UK, many coastal populations have
   substantial proportions of territories occupied by nonbreeding birds.
   Population growth has involved both an increase in breeding density and
   expansion of breeding distribution, the latter especially through
   increased use of nest sites on small cliffs, quarries, buildings, rocky
   banks and even the ground. Both kinds of increase have been fuelled by a
   substantial increase in production and probably survival, reflecting the
   disappearance of pesticide problems, reduced persecution through
   protection efforts, and locally enhanced food supply through growth of
   pigeon racing. The failure of the northern coastal population to recover
   is attributed mainly to contamination by marine pollutants through the
   food chain, although this needs further research.}},

Abstract = {{A second partial survey of breeding Peregrines in the Republic of
   Ireland was undertaken in 1991, duplicating the methodology and areas
   covered 10 years previously. The survey located 123 occupied
   territories; when corrected for incomplete coverage a fetal of 141 was
   estimated, an increase of at least 23-26\% since 1981. Birds have also
   recently spread onto quarries, mainly outside survey areas; these have
   been surveyed independently. Overall, there were an estimated 350-355
   occupied territories in the Republic, 17-18\% of which were in quarries.
   Breeding range is shown to be limited by weather, operating through the
   interaction of spring rainfall levels, cliff size and cliff orientation.
   On cliffs >36 m high untenanted territories are only found in
   high-rainfall areas and oriented NW to NE. With decreasing cliff size,
   the vacancies affect a broader spectrum of cliff orientations, and at
   lower rainfall levels. Most currently unoccupied natural cliff sites
   appear to be vacant because of weather limitations, although the data
   suggest room for continuing expansion among quarry sites. Productivity
   averaged 1.18 young/territorial pair. While exceptionally wet weather in
   early April generally had a limited impact on breeding, it initially
   caused major problems in finding Peregrines and probably led to
   underestimates of the population in parts of the west.}},

   Fish provisioning by the adult male was maintained during the

   first individual to disappear from the nesting area, followed by the

Abstract = {{The breeding success of 2 Common Buzzard Buteo buteo populations in the
   north of Scotland, were studied over the period 1977-89. Marked
   differences were found in breeding density, clutch size and nesting
   success. An examination of prey remains found at nests in the 2 areas
   provided a possible explanation. The move successful population in Moray
   were feeding on large prey items such as Rabbits and Wood Pigeons,
   whereas the other population in Glen Urquhart, fed more on voles and
   small passerine birds. A parallel study on Tawny Owls in Glen Urquhart
   showed a strong correlation between their annual breeding success and
   that of the local buzzards. This fluctuated on a 4-year cycle and was
   probably in response to vole abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The fish community of Loch Lomond has changed rapidly in recent years
   following introductions of 5 new species of fish. The response of the
   most abundant resident, piscivorous bird, the Grey Heron Ardea cinerea,
   to the sudden arrival and rapid population expansion of potential prey
   species is evaluated here. The relative rate of predation of fish by
   herons during the breeding season and the size of the breeding
   population before (1978) and after (1990) new species invasions is
   compared. In addition the relative abundance of fish prey species after
   the introduction of new species is examined.
   In 1978 the discarded remains of fish below the nests of breeding herons
   was dominated by native Roach Rutilus rutilus (63\%). By 1990, at the
   same colony, at the same time of year, discards comprised mainly Ruffe
   Gymnocephalus cernuus (61\%). It would appear that this diet shift was
   not the result of a lack of available Roach, rather that it was a
   functional shift in prey choice by herons to a more abundant, more
   easily caught species. The size of the heron breeding population was
   slightly smaller in 1990 than in 1978, but increased between 1986 and
   1990, although this coincided with a period of rapid growth in the Ruffe
   population, there is no evidence of a causal relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Sand Martins experienced a dramatic population crash in Britain and
   elsewhere during 1983-84. Numbers breeding in central Scotland in 1984
   were 27\% of those in 1983, probably as a consequence of severe drought
   in the wintering quarters. Selection for small size during the
   population crash was demonstrated.(1) This paper shows that by the late
   1980s the Sand Martin population in central Scotland had recovered to
   the level typical of the early years of the decade. Moreover,
   keel-length, used as a measure of body-size, had assumed a similar value
   to that found before the population crash. The return of severe drought
   to the wintering grounds in 1990 was associated with a fall in bath
   numbers and keel-length at the study site by 1991. We evaluate
   hypotheses which attempt to explain the positive correlation between
   body-size and colony-size, and conclude that the observed changes in
   mean keel-length are probably caused by selective mortality of different
   sizes of birds outside of the breeding season and probably in Africa.}},

Abstract = {{A census of singing Corncrakes throughout Britain was carried out in
   1993. Ten-kilometre National Grid squares in Scotland which held the
   species in 1978/79 and/or 1988 were searched systematically by night.
   Elsewhere records of singing birds were obtained by means of publicity
   and checked for accuracy. A total of 480 singing males was counted in 83
   10-km squares. Ninety-hue per cent of the population was found in the
   Hebridean Islands. The total count was 17\% smaller than in 1988 and at
   least 34\% less than in 1978. The average rate of population decline
   between 1988 and 1993 was 3.5\% per year, which teas more rapid than
   during the previous 10 years. There were considerable differences among
   islands and areas in the rate of change of the Corncrake population. In
   some areas the population had increased, but in Orkney there had been an
   82\% decline in 5 years. Areas with high rates of decline between 1978
   and 1988 also tended to show rapid declines between 1988 and 1993. The
   census results and conservation measures are discussed in the context of
   other studies of factors associated with the decline. The evidence
   available is consistent with the idea that improved management of
   habitats on the breeding grounds offers the best prospects for recovery.
   A recent development is the occurrence of small numbers of Corncrakes
   (6) on set-aside land on arable farmland in England and Scotland. The
   conditions under which this new habitat could be used more extensively
   by Corncrakes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The elusive behaviour and preference for dense aquatic vegetation has
   resulted in a lack of information regarding most aspects of Water Rail
   Rallus aquaticus ecology. This paper reports on the results of a study
   of Water Pails within a small (0.5 ha) inland reedbed at
   Newbridge-on-Wye, mid-Wales, during autumn and winter 1993-94. Birds
   used a substantial proportion of the reedbed (captures made 30-60 m
   apart), occupying home ranges which appeared to overlap, although
   different individuals nevertheless favoured different areas of the
   reedbed. Evidence is presented that the site was deserted during a
   period of freezing weather, but that birds re-occupied their original
   home ranges upon their return. Frequent trapping of birds also permitted
   an estimation of absolute population density (14 birds per ha), a figure
   much higher than previously recorded at other sites where birds were
   counted only indirectly. These data indicate that trapping can yield
   valuable information on aspects of the ecology of this little-known
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between a series of environmental variables and the
   abundance of individual species of forest birds were examined in 58
   large woodlands along a band crossing the Iberian Peninsula from north
   to south.  The variables were mean annual rainfall, mean annual
   temperature, density of trees <20 cm in diameter, density of trees > 30
   cm in diameter, floristic composition (conifer or broadleaved trees) and
   geographical situation (distance from northern extreme of study band). 
   The variable most highly correlated with bird density was mean annual
   rainfall (40\% of the species had significant partial correlations with
   this parameter).  The northern species (Chiffchaff, Goldcrest, Robin,
   Song Thrush, Bullfinch, etc.) generally correlated positively with mean
   annual rainfall, while the Mediterranean species (Sardinian Warbler,
   Bonelli's Warbler, Black-eared Wheatear, Rock Sparrow, Spotless
   Starling, Azurewinged Magpie, etc.) exhibited an inverse pattern.  Mean
   annual temperature (36\%) was also closely associated with bird
   distribution, but did not show clear tendencies according to
   biogeographic groups.  Floristic composition (26\%) was a strong
   determinant of the abundance of species distributed throughout the whole
   Iberian Peninsula and geographical situation (22\%) largely determined
   the distribution of the northern and Mediterranean species.  Finally,
   density of trees <20 cm in diameter (20\%) and <30 cm in diameter (14\%)
   generally showed a negative association with the majority of the
   species, particularly the Mediterranean species.}},

Abstract = {{Seabirds in north-west European waters were surveyed offshore throughout
   the year from 1979 to 1993.  During the breeding season the distribution
   of Manx Shearwaters centred around the main colonies of Rhum, Skomer and
   Skokholm.  Densities were low in the North Sea, where birds were mainly
   restricted to waters off the north-east coasts of England and Scotland,
   in particular the Moray Firth, the Firth of Forth and Flamborough Head. 
   Manx Shearwaters can forage at long distances from the colonies, but
   highest densities were observed in the Irish Sea, south-west Wales,
   south-west Ireland and the inshore waters of West Scotland during the
   chick-rearing period when parent birds visit the colony more frequently.
   The area of the Irish Sea front was important, particularly in the
   autumn, and feeding occurred here in preference to other areas of the
   Irish Sea.  From November to February Manx Shearwaters were virtually
   absent from north-west European waters.}},

Abstract = {{Tawny Owls respond well to imitation or playback of conspecific calls. 
   In 94\% of known territories a response to imitation was obtained within
   30 min.  No measured temporal or weather variable had any effect on
   response time.  The only factor that appeared to influence response time
   was population density, with birds in open farmland responding faster
   and more vigorously than those in continuous woodland.  This is
   considered to be due to lack of exposure to other owls in open farmland.
   Female owls respond more to imitated male calls in autumn than in winter
   and spring.  This may be due to the fact that autumn is when pair
   formation occurs, and females may be investigating new males. 
   Alternatively they may be defending their territory at a time when
   juveniles are searching for vacancies.  The findings suggest that
   censusing should be conducted for 30 min, at any time throughout the
   winter and in any reasonable weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a survey of wintering Corn Buntings
   in Britain organized by the British Trust for Ornithology during winter
   1992/93.  The survey collected information on the distribution, numbers
   and habitat selection of Corn Buntings throughout their known range in
   Britain in order to assess winter habitat requirements.  Volunteers
   surveyed a total of 1313 tetrads which between them held nearly 3000
   birds in 222 flocks.  Sixty-four per cent of flocks held fewer than 10
   birds.  Fifty per cent of flocks and 60\% of birds were recorded on
   stubble.  Weed-rich stubble held approximately twice the numbers of
   flocks and birds as clean stubble.  Corn Buntings showed a stronger
   preference for stubbles than for any other field type.  Winter cereals
   and improved grassland were generally avoided whilst bare till and
   unimproved (or semi-improved) grassland were used in proportion to their
   availability.  Areas which lost breeding birds between the 2 Breeding
   Atlas periods contained less weedrich stubble and less arable land
   generally than areas which retained breeding birds.  However, there were
   no significant differences in the availability of stubble between
   tetrads in which birds were recorded on stubbles and those in which they
   were recorded on other field types.  Flocks recorded on stubble were not
   significantly larger than those recorded on other field types and did
   not differ in size between different regions of Britain.  The results of
   the survey suggest that recent changes in agricultural policy, if
   implemented sympathetically, are likely to benefit this species in
   winter.}},

Abstract = {{Chick mortality, prey size delivery and parental feeding rate of Great
   Crested Grebes were studied on ponds differing in fish species,
   densities and biomass on a fish-farm in the south-east of the
   Netherlands.  Chick mortality was highest during the first 2 weeks of
   life.  Our results showed that amongst chicks younger than 3 weeks old,
   the rate of biomass intake per brood was correlated with the estimated
   prey abundance.  Chick survival was highest amongst broods which
   received more food per unit time.  Prey size increased as the young grew
   older, but older chicks still received very small items.  On Carp ponds,
   parents delivered more prey per unit time to small young than on
   Roach/Rudd ponds, but the rate of fish biomass delivery did not vary
   among pond types.  This is because on average fish caught at Carp ponds
   were smaller than at Roach/Rudd ponds.  Presumably parental fishing
   opportunities in combination with prevailing weather conditions
   determine partial brood loss in Great Crested Grebe chicks.}},

Abstract = {{Census data show that the distribution of Pink-footed Geese Anser
   brachyrhynchus in different parts of their winter range in Britain
   changes within seasons.  Large numbers arrive during October and
   November in Grampian Region, east-central Scotland, Borders Region,
   Lothian Region and Lancashire.  Numbers peak in England during
   mid-winter, with few persisting into March, by which time the more
   sedentary winter populations of south-west Scotland and throughout
   eastern Scotland have begun to be augmented, presumably through arrivals
   from further south.  Maximum numbers occur in northern Grampian and the
   Moray Firth from March onwards and peak during April.  Individually
   marked Pink-footed Geese captured in Lancashire dispersed to the Ribble
   Estuary, the south Lancashire Mosses and elsewhere in north-west
   England.  Part of this population moves on to spend mid-winter in
   Norfolk.  In January, there is a conspicuous migration northwards in
   Britain, with individuals travelling through Fylde, the Solway and
   east-central Scotland, reaching Grampian and the Moray Firth by
   mid-March.  Recovery and recapture data from ringing in the 1950s
   suggest that this pattern is long established.  We suggest that
   Pink-footed Geese, which feed mainly on grass in spring, are responding
   to a gradient of plant growth (particularly the high protein content
   associated with the onset of growth), utilizing the differential
   occurrence of the `spring-bite' in northward staging towards their
   ultimate destination - the breeding areas in Iceland and Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Causes of nest failure among the four lowland buntings in the UK,
   Yellowhammer, Cirl Bunting, Reed Bunting and Corn Bunting, were
   investigated using records from 1924-92 held by the BTO's Nest Record
   Scheme. Three main types of failure were identified: nest-predation,
   destruction by agricultural operations (e.g. crop harvesting, cattle
   trampling, hedge cutting) and natural causes (e.g. rain, adult
   predated). Nest predation accounted for a third of nests of
   Yellowhammer, Cirl Bunting and Reed Bunting but was less important for
   corn Bunting. Nest predation was more prevalent during the nestling
   stage than egg stage, and failure due to agricultural operations
   occurred move during the egg stage than nestling stage for Yellowhammer
   and Reed Bunting. Many farmland species have shown population declines
   since 1970, coinciding with changes in predator populations, farming
   practices and possibly weather patterns, and the relative importance of
   each cause in pre- and post-1970 samples was therefore compared. Corn
   Bunting showed an increase in the relative importance of lasses due to
   farming processes between the two periods from 10\% to 43\% of reported
   failures, representing an approximate increase in the proportion of
   nests affected from 7\% to 22\%, although the overall failure rate was
   lower in the post-1970 sample. causes of nest failure were essentially
   unchanged far Yellowhammer and Reed Bunting. No such comparison was
   possible for Cirl Bunting due to a paucity of early records.}},

Abstract = {{A breeding colony of European Starlings Sturnus vulgaris was observed
   every morning for a month prior to egg-laying. The whole colony was
   either involved in singing activity around the nest boxes, or feeding as
   one big flock in fields. Switches between these 2 activities were sudden
   and complete with it short intermediate stage when all the birds
   gathered in a tight group on overhead electricity wires. The switches
   between singing and feeding occurred approximately twice an hour, and
   local weather conditions had no apparent effect on these switches in
   behaviour. As egg-laying approached, more time was spent at the nestbox
   colony, with fewer birds feeding in the fields at any one time. Later in
   the season longer initial periods were spent at the nestbox colony
   before the first feeding excursions to the fields, resulting in fewer
   switches between singing and feeding activities. The switches between
   the 2 activities also became less distinct nearer egg-laying with the
   flock breaking up into smaller units and feeding in fields closer to the
   nestbox colony.}},

Abstract = {{We set out to test the proposition(3) that curlews' bills are decurved
   to allow them to follow a complex 3-dimensional search path when
   feeding. This was done using wooden models of more and female bills,
   both with and without normal curvature. These were inserted into crab
   burrows in saltmarsh creeks and into gaps under rocks on the shore.
   Curved bills penetrated further than straight ones into both types of
   cavity. Curved bills were also capable of greater rotation at maximum
   penetration. This suggests that Curlews can reach more crabs by having
   curved bills, and having reached them, can grasp them more ef
   effectively. Female bills penetrated further than male ones, but male
   bills rotated more at equivalent penetration distances. Thus, although a
   short bill cannot penetrate as far, it is probably more efficient at
   extracting food items from smaller cavities.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the Southern African Kestrel Falco tinnunculus rupicolus was
   studied in both a flat and a hilly area in the eastern Cape Province,
   South Africa. Diet was determined by direct observation of prey
   captured, prey brought to nests and an analysis of pellets collected on
   a monthly basis throughout the year. The main component of the diet
   consisted of arthropods, primarily Orthoptera and Arachnida, while the
   few vertebrates eaten included birds and lizards. Southern African
   Kestrels on the flats ate more vertebrate prey than those in the hills.
   Arthropods were taken throughout the year, whereas vertebrates were
   taken mainly during winter by Southern African Kestrels on the flats.
   Vertebrates were taken more often during flight-hunting on the flats,
   and by perch-hunting in the hills. Males brought vertebrates to the
   females during incubation, whereas the chicks were fed vertebrates and
   arthropods during nestling and post-fledging periods. Diet differed from
   that of western European Kestrels by having a large invertebrate
   component for both breeding and Mon-breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Over 30 County Bird Recorders were asked in 1983 and 1990 to provide
   population estimates of breeding hobbies for 1982 and 1989. In 1990 data
   were also requested on the number of hobby records submitted and the
   total number of observers submitting records for any species annually
   between 1970 and 1990. These data were used to calculate indices of
   abundance for 8 counties. The results suggest that the population has
   expanded vapidly since the early 1980s, particularly in the south and
   east midlands; less marked increases were also recorded in East Anglia,
   the Welsh Marches, south-west England and the north midlands. Reasons
   for the population increase are not clear. The present population is
   estimated at between 500 and 1000 pairs, but more local studies are
   required to provide better evidence of population changes.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of nectar-feeding by 2 pairs of slue Tits Parus caeruleus
   was investigated in relation to the availability of nectar and
   alternative food. Nectar was not the most preferred food and the
   occurrence of nectar-feeding did not correlate significantly with most
   measures of nectar availability, but the Blue Tits selected the most
   productive powers. Nectar-feeding frequently occurred when the preferred
   peanuts were unavailable due to interspecific competition. The nectar
   resource runs under-utilized by the Blue Tits except at the beginning of
   the flowering period. Despite this, nectar was 8 highly profitable load
   source, yielding 0.33-0.38 kJ min(-1) foraging. During the flowering
   period nectar was estimated to contribute up to 32.7\% of the average
   daily metabolic rate (ADMR) of the male and up to 49.3\% of the ADMR of
   the female, with means over the 2 years of 7.40\% and 13.2\% per day for
   the male and female, respectively. The importance of nectar in the
   ecology of slue Tits is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in mass during moult were investigated by analysis of data
   recorded on standard moult cards by members of the British Trust for
   Ornithology Ringing Scheme, In the analysis of post-juvenile moult, all
   available cards that presented wing length, mass and time of capture
   were used. The analysis of adult post-nuptial moult was restricted to
   cards from a single year. Juvenile mass correlated strongly with body
   size, time of day and the number of greater coverts being replaced.
   After controlling for the effects of size and time of day, mass was
   found to increase with date except in those individuals in which all
   juvenile greater coverts were retained. In these birds residual mass
   declined with date. In adult males, mass increased with both date and
   moult scores of primary, secondary and tertial remiges and of rectrices
   but because of the strong correlations between moult scores and date,
   the true relationship was not clear. In adult females, mass declined
   with date before increasing again. Unlike the males, female moult scores
   did not predict body mass. However, the timing of moult was a strong
   predictor of body mass. The differences between age and sex groups are
   discussed in relation to the nutritional demands of moult.}},

Abstract = {{The flocking behaviour of Treecreepers within mixed-species flocks was
   studied from December to March during 1989190 and 1990191. Treecreepers
   tended to flock more in mid-winter and during 1990191 when mean
   temperature was lower. Tree trunks were the most common foraging sites.
   Internal branches > 5 cm diameter were also commonly used although less
   so as flock-size increased. The niche-breadth of Treecreeper foraging
   sites narrowed as flock-size increased. In each year there was a
   significant positive relationship between flock-size and the
   pecking-rate of Treecreepers. Pecking-rate was not related to ambient
   temperature and did not differ between tree species. We suggest that the
   main benefit to Treecreepers of joining mixed-species flocks is the
   avoidance of predation.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding ecology of wintering Little Grebes was studied on a brackish
   tidal river in central West Wales during the winters of 1981/2-1983/4.
   Peak numbers occurred in late November and mid-February. Increased wind
   strength reduced the likelihood of birds being present in the study
   area. The frequency of their occurrence was highest at low and high
   tide, when flood conditions made shallow water (< 2 m) available for
   feeding. Little Grebes foraged for 85-89\% of daylight hours, and
   evidence is provided to suggest that feeding only occurs during the day
   at this site. Inter-dive recovery time increased exponentially with dive
   duration, suggesting increased energetic costs of prolonged dives. Dive
   time increased with water depth, hence feeding at greater depths is
   probably disproportionately more costly than in shallow water. Since
   feeding success (based on prey handling on the water surface) also
   declined with depth of the water column, it would appear that the
   observed patterns of use of shallow water in time and space are related
   to the energetic costs and benefits of foraging in different water
   depths.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether or not male Black Kite behaviour increases his
   chance of paternity, the copulation behaviour of 4 pairs was studied in
   Nagasaki Peninsula in 1991 and 1992. Of 246 within-pair copulation
   attempts observed, 224 (91 \%) resulted in cloacal contact. The majority
   of copulation failures was attributed to refusal of the female,
   indicating that the female is capable of controlling copulation.
   Successful copulations were frequent from about 20 days prior to
   egg-laying until 1 day after laying. During this frequent copulation
   period, copulations occurred most often in the morning. From
   approximately 20 days prior to egg-laying onwards, the female Black Kite
   depended entirely on food delivered by her partner. There was no
   relationship between courtship feeding and copulation; that is,
   presentation of food to the female by her partner was not a prerequisite
   for copulation. Most of the copulations occurred soon after the male
   returned to the nesting site, suggesting that the male tries to ensure
   his paternity. Furthermore, the following predictions of the paternity
   assurance hypothesis were supported: (1) frequent intrusions into the
   nesting site by other males, and (2) intense aggression against
   intruders by the pair male compared with the pair female. Thus, it
   appeared that the male Black Kite tries to improve his likelihood of
   paternity.}},

   behaviour in the Egyptian Vulture. The study was carried out in northern
   Spain during 1989-91. Pair copulations began around 25 days before
   laying and were uncommon after the first egg was laid. Some copulations
   (11.6\%) were observed during the nestling period. Two extra-pair
   copulation attempts were observed. The copulation behaviour of Egyptian
   Vultures seems to be exceptional when compared with other raptors: mate
   attendance was intensive, especially during the days prior to laying and
   copulation frequency was high even considering only those performed in
   the nesting territory: 55 +/- 18 copulations/female between days - 15
   and 0, and a maximum of 9 copulations/female/day during the presumed
   fertile period. Some copulations also occcurred during foraging trips.}},

Abstract = {{Annual surveys of breeding Merlins were carried out between 1970 and
   1991 with more systematic effort from 1982 onwards. Mean annual
   occupancy rates did not differ significantly between heather, moorland
   tree and conifer plantation nest areas. Mean occupancy rates declined
   significantly in heather and moorland tree nest areas between 1970 and
   1991. These declines are probably associated with a progressive switch
   to conifer plantation nest areas that have ultimately affected over 50\%
   of breeding pairs. The Welsh population has probably remained relatively
   stable throughout the study period at approximately 60-70 pairs. The
   switch to conifer plantations is related to habitat; the switch was most
   pronounced on the grass moors of central and south Wales and probably
   occurred between 1975 and 1985, whereas on the heather moors of north
   Wales only a small number of ground-nesting sites have been vacated
   since 1985. This was partly due to the lack of afforestation on most of
   the Berwyn Mountains.
   The population changes in Wales are compared with those in other regions
   of Britain. It is suggested that, with the exception of the Northern
   Isles, the British breeding Merlin population no longer merits special
   conservation concern and should be removed from the `Red Data' list of
   British birds. However, its sensitivity to toxic contamination makes it
   a most useful environmental indicator species and future monitoring of
   populations is highly desirable.}},

Abstract = {{The ring recoveries of Woodcock ringed in the British Isles were
   analysed with those ringed abroad and recovered in the British Isles
   during the period 1909-1990. The annual adult survival rate for
   British-ringed Woodcock was estimated as 58 +/- 2\% (+/- se) and
   first-year survival was estimated as 47 +/- 2\% (+/- se). These survival
   rates require an annual production of 1.8 fledged chicks per adult
   female to maintain a stable population.
   Most British-ringed Woodcock exhibit fidelity to the natal area in
   winter and subsequent breeding seasons, although in winter c. 13\% move
   to Ireland and c. 4\% to mainland Europe. These movements were not
   associated with cold weather and it is probable that a small component
   of the British Woodcock population is truly migratory.
   Continental Woodcock visiting Britain originate from Finland and, to a
   laser extent, from Sweden and Norway. They first arrive in October and
   move rapidly south-west so that the proportion of foreign-ringed to
   British-ringed birds in winter is highest in southern England and Wales.
   Some Continental Woodcock remain in Britain until mid-April but there is
   no evidence that any stay to breed. The majority of Woodcock shot in
   Britain are foreign-bred birds.}},

Abstract = {{Growth in nidifugeous wader chicks depends on food availability, and
   growth rates may be considerably reduced when food is in short supply.
   Bill-length and body-weight respond differently to reduced growth rates,
   and to recovery after a period of reduced growth. A condition index (CI)
   can therefore be derived from the relationship between bill-length and
   body-weight: CI = observed weight/expected weight for the observed
   bill-length. Standardized weights for observed bill-lengths are
   presented for Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa
   limosa, Redshank Tringa totanus, and Oystercatcher Haematopus
   ostralegus. Annual variations in condition indices were similar across
   species and in the case of Lapwing were correlated with total rainfall
   in May. Similar fluctuations in chick survival were also correlated with
   rainfall in May suggesting a relationship between condition index and
   fledging success.}},

Abstract = {{The Dotterel, one of Britain's rarer breeding birds, nests on montane
   plateaux. Numbers and distribution of breeding Dotterel in Britain were
   determined by an extensive survey in 1987 and 1988 combined with a
   detailed on-going study. One hundred and twenty-eight montane tops were
   surveyed (56\% of all potential breeding habitat). Three hundred and
   thirty-three breeding `pairs' (males are virtually solely responsible
   for incubation and chick rearing) were found, with an overall mean
   density of 1.7 pairs/km(2). The counts were corrected, conservatively,
   giving a revised population estimate of >840 breeding pairs. Most pairs
   (65\%) are in the eastern Scottish Highlands, the stronghold of the
   species in the European Community (EC). Larger numbers than previously
   estimated were found. The species is more abundant and widespread
   throughout the central, western and northern Scottish Highlands than
   hitherto estimated. The apparent population increase is partly
   attributed to a more intensive survey effort, and partly to a genuine
   increase (more birds passing through Britain may stop off to breed, and
   climatic change in Norway may influence more settlements in Britain).
   Dotterel merit protection under the EC Directive on the Conservation of
   Wild Birds, and this survey, based mainly on the efforts of volunteers,
   has provided information used to identify proposed montane Special
   Protection Areas.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and status of Shovelers using British wetlands in
   autumn and winter was examined using ringing recoveries and National
   Waterfowl Count data. Maximum counts have been around 8500 and suggest a
   total population of c. 10 000. Some of these birds originate from
   north-west continental Europe, eastern Scandinavia and the Western
   former USSR, whilst others originate from British breeding populations.
   Numbers peaked in October, after which there was a steady emigration
   from Britain as birds moved to France, the Iberian Peninsula and
   Mediterranean for the winter. The population fell sharply during the
   early 1960s and then increased up until 1971/72. Since then there has
   been a gradual, though slight, decline. The number counted decreased
   nationally during periods of cold weather, suggesting cold weather
   emigrations. Wintering Shovelers have increased their usage of
   reservoirs and mineral workings, and slightly decreased their usage of
   natural lakes. Patterns of seasonal occurrence varied between regions
   and habitats. Numbers peaked early in northern Britain and progressively
   later in regions to the south. An early season peak was evident on
   natural lakes and reservoirs, but occurred progressively later on gravel
   pits, on the coast and on floodlands. Shovelers were recorded at 10-20\%
   of the c. 1800 sites visited during the period 1985/86 to 1989/90 and,
   of these, 84\% held fewer than 50 birds. A total of 51 sites supported
   nationally important numbers (>90) and these held 46-70\% of the
   population. Whilst protection of these sites is a high priority for the
   conservation of this species, wider countryside policies are needed to
   maintain the population throughout its range in Britain.}},

Abstract = {{The post-fledging dependence period of 37 Red Kites was studied in the
   Donana Biological Reserve (Spain). The juveniles fledged at a mean age
   of 55.1 days and remained near the nest, depending on their parents for
   food, for on average a further 25.6 days. Flight behaviour of the
   fledglings showed both a gradual increase in time spent flying and a
   transition from flapping to gliding and soaring flights. Hunting
   behaviour and manipulative play with objects were very rare during 511
   hours spent observing juveniles during the post-fledging dependence
   period. It seems that juveniles do not start searching for food until
   they are independent. On average young kites were captured in baited
   traps for the first time 31.5 days after fledging. Some juveniles
   dispersed from the natal area as they became independent but most
   remained in the natal area for a variable period of up to 42 days before
   dispersal. Mortality during the post-fledging period was 13.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{A method for censusing upland breeding waders using constant search
   effort is described. Estimates of the size of breeding wader populations
   obtained using this method were usually underestimates compared to those
   derived from more intensive studies. In a sample of 28 fields, the
   numbers of breeding Lapwings Vanellus vanellus were underestimated by an
   average of 49\%. This error was consistent across a range of breeding
   densities, thus allowing correction of the original population
   estimates. Further validation studies are required for other species.
   Using the method a single field worker can survey approximately 80 km(2)
   in a single breeding season. The method is well suited to extensive
   survey and may also be of value in the long-term monitoring of upland
   breeding wader populations.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding ecology of Shags was investigated in Argyll, Western
   Scotland, with particular reference to cage fish farms. Most Shags were
   recorded during winter, presumably having dispersed from breeding
   colonies elsewhere. The proportion of adults increased during October
   and remained at about 75\% until February before falling to zero in
   June. Shags apparently did not take fish from farm cages but attacked
   them through the netting. Losses to Shags were confined to the smallest
   stock and represented 0.1\% of the 17 302 dead fish examined at one
   farm. Most of the fish eaten by Shags near farms were wild fishes that
   concentrate around the cages. The diet of birds differed between years
   apparently reflecting the local abundance of juvenile fish. Observations
   of feeding Shags appeared to underestimate the proportion of small (<5
   g) fishes in the diet suggesting that birds swallowed some prey
   underwater. Thus intake rates based on surface observations were minimum
   values. Adult birds had consistently higher feeding success and intake
   rates than juveniles both near a fish farm and in the natural habitat.
   There was no evidence that intake rates of either adult or juvenile
   birds differed between the fish farm and the natural habitat.}},

Abstract = {{A sample of 140 Red-billed Chough pellets (35 from each season) was
   collected from communal roosting sites in south-east Spain. In almost
   every pellet there were three distinct dietary fractions: animal,
   vegetable and mineral. The animal fraction constituted nearly 50\% of
   the pellet volume in each of the four seasons. Wild grains and
   cultivated cereals were the most important vegetable elements, while
   60\% of animal prey (n= 3484) were beetles (mainly Tenebrionidae). There
   was marked seasonal variation in the composition of both the vegetable
   and animal fractions, the latter associated mainly with variation in the
   occurrence of Orthoptera, Lepidoptera larvae and Formicidae. Mixed
   flocks of Choughs and Jackdaws were common in the study area though
   agonistic interspecific interactions were never observed. The diets of
   the two species differ in that Choughs eat more beetles and wild seeds,
   whilst Jackdaws prefer ants and cereals. These observations support the
   hypothesis that competition from Jackdaws is not responsible for the
   reduction in the Chough's range.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of a declining population of Golden Plovers may have been
   prevented by high nest predation from Carrion Crows Corvus corone and
   Common Gulls Larus canus. In order to test this hypothesis predators
   were experimentally removed from Kerloch moor in NE Scotland during
   1986-89. Although the numbers of crows and gulls were significantly
   reduced, no young Golden Plover hatched at Kerloch and breeding numbers
   continued to decline. Numbers also declined on a less intensive study
   area 50 km further away where predators were not removed and where
   hatching success was poor (except in 1986). Hatching success of other
   moorland waders was generally higher during the experiment than before
   it, but breeding numbers did not increase. The removal of crows and
   gulls did not lead to increases in the breeding populations of Golden
   Plovers and other waders, although the outcome of the experiment was
   complicated by rising nest predation from foxes Vulpes vulpes which may
   have masked any benefits from the removal of other predators.}},

   analyse data on nest predation, clutch size and fledgling production in
   128 Jackdaw nests in order to test if clutches are larger in the safer
   sites. The predation rate was positively correlated with the minimum
   nest-entrance dimensions (predation is greater in nests with large
   entrances). Clutch size was not related to the risk of nest predation,
   and our data do not therefore support the nest predation hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are highly mobile animals and we need to understand the factors
   and processes that determine numbers throughout their range and annual
   life cycle. Most avian studies have concentrated on birds using one
   locality at a particular time of year, but the numbers breeding or
   wintering in any one locality may be affected by the size of the greater
   population of which the local group forms a part, as well as by local
   conditions. Equilibrium theory provides a useful framework within which
   to analyse populations at this larger scale, although the meaning and
   usefulness of some of the concepts used for investigating local groups
   may change. New approaches are required in which mathematical models are
   used to integrate the results of studies on the behavioural and
   population ecology of local groups with those of large-scale monitoring
   programmes of the kind conducted by the BTO.}},

Abstract = {{In previous papers, we examined the use of deserted and addled eggs of
   the Dipper Cinclus cinclus as monitors of the contamination of upland
   rivers by persistent organochlorines. Here, we examine and interpret
   differences between the organochlorine content of eggs from adjacent
   sub-catchments of rivers in Wales. We provide information particularly
   on individual polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for which few data are
   available on wild birds generally.
   There were no significant differences between catchments in egg
   concentrations of total PCBs, although two individual PCB chemicals (or
   congeners) showed significant differences in concentration or incidence
   of occurrence. PCB congener 118 (2,3', 4,4', 5 Pentachlorobiphenyl)
   showed a reduction in concentration on a SW-NE gradient through south
   and mid-Wales reflecting possible sources in the coastal industrial
   belt. However, significantly elevated concentrations in Irish eggs
   suggest the possibility of more remote origins to the west. PCB 101
   (2,2,4,5,5' Pentachlorobiphenyl) was found significantly more often in
   eggs from sub-catchments in mid-Wales than from south Wales. Further
   data on the sources, transport, persistence and ecotoxicity of
   individual PCB congeners are required before these results can be seen
   in context. There was a marked reduction in total PCB concentrations in
   Dipper eggs between 1988 and 1990 which continued into 1991.
   Significant variation between catchments in HEOD (from the insecticides
   Aldrin and Dieldrin) reflected land use. Levels in eggs increased
   significantly where river catchments had high sheep densities. HEOD
   concentrations in eggs correlated with bacteriological features in river
   water which were indicators of high stock densities. These patterns are
   consistent with the former legal or latterly illicit use of Dieldrin in
   sheepdip, although the concentrations present in Dipper eggs declined
   between 1988 and 1990.
   We conclude that, at least within regions, Dipper eggs can aid in the
   detection of local patterns in the contamination of rivers by some
   persistent organochlorines.}},

Abstract = {{Almost 1500 Nest Record Cards for the Little Grebe collected by the
   British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), between 1938 and 1988, were
   analysed in order to understand better its breeding biology. The numbers
   of cards per year decreased following severe winters, suggesting the
   species' susceptibility to hard weather. The date of laying of the first
   egg extended from February to September, with a mode in early May. Modal
   clutch size was 4 (range 1-8), and modal brood size 3, but there were
   problems in observing broods reliably due to the species' secretive
   behaviour. Fifty-three per cent of nests whose outcome was known were
   successful; 35 \% of nest failures were due to flooding. Nests on ponds
   and lakes were significantly more successful than those on rivers and
   streams; laying dates varied significantly between wetland types, with
   nests on canals earliest and those on rivers latest. Nests on rivers,
   subject to fluctuating water levels, experienced significantly higher
   rates of failure through flooding than those on waters such as canals,
   where water levels were artificially controlled.}},

Abstract = {{Nest site occupancy by Lesser Kestrels was studied in three colonies
   located in churches in southern Spain. Occupied nest-holes were located
   significantly higher than unused potential nest-holes. Precise nest
   dimensions, on the other hand, seemed to be of secondary importance. As
   breeding success was positively correlated with the height on the nest,
   we suggest that Lesser Kestrels selected the highest positions to avoid
   predation and disturbance (by carnivores or humans). Additionally, 78\%
   of all breeding attempts were in previously ooccupied nest-holes and
   were more successful than attetmts in holes used only once during the
   3-year study.  The fact that re-occupied, and hence preferred, nest
   registered earlier laying dates, suggests that a hierarchy might by
   established at the time of selcecting the nest site, This hierarchy
   would be determined by the different times of arrival of each individual
   at the ecolony after the winter.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the occurence of birds in gardens in 14 countries in western
   Europe was conducted between 23 October 1988 and 20 May 1989. Most of
   the 440 participating gardens were on the edge of towns and 40\% had
   trees, grass and shrubs. Their average size as 1608 m2. One hundred and
   seventy-six species of birds were recorded in all, with a mean of 21 per
   garden. Garden size was the most important factor determining the number
   of species present; gardens with both deciduous and coniferous trees had
   comparatively many species, urban gardens had comparatively few. The
   frequency with which artificial food was provided had little effect on
   the number of species recorded in a garden. The frequency of provision
   differed between countries but was uniformly greater in winter than in
   spring. Although there were substantial regional differences, the broad
   suite of species entering gardens was similar throughout Europe, the
   commonest species being Great Tit, Blackbird, Blue Tit, House Sparrow,
   Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Robin and Magpie. The occurrence of many species

Abstract = {{This paper describes a study of the diet of Shags using regurgitations
   by chicks, stomach contents and pellets collected concurrently. Sandeels
   predominated in all collections. Non- and failed breeders took a wider
   food spectrum than did chicks. Although adults fed their chicks almost
   entirely on sandeels, they themselves ate some fish from other fish
   families and probably digested these before they returned to the colony.
   Pellets are easy to collect and are useful to detect gross changes in
   diet of full-grown, but possibly non-breeding, Shags between years or
   colonies. Otoliths recovered from pellets cannot be used for age
   determination or back-calculations of size of sandeels eaten by Shags.
   Regurgitations can be used to describe the diet of chicks. There is no
   easy way to determine the diet of adults feeding chicks.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ascertain the effects of aero-generators on breeding birds,
   two moorland plots in Orkney's West Mainland were censused each year
   between 1981 and 1989. One plot was immediately adjacent to the
   aero-generator site while the other acted as a control. Although the
   bird populations in the plots were not large enough to state
   categorically that the aero-generators caused no declines, their effects
   appear to have been minimal. The only species to have been adversely
   affected by the development of the site was Red-throated Diver Gavia
   stellata and its decline was probably the result of factors other than
   the operation of the aero-generators.}},

Abstract = {{Methods are described to assess the molluscan diet of Knots feeding on
   intertidal flats in western Europe from their faecal output. The size
   distributions of two common bivalve prey, Macoma balthica and
   Cerastoderma edule, can be estimated from the heights of shell hinges
   retrieved from droppings. The average ingested size of the tiny mudsnail
   Hydrobia ulvae can be reconstructed from partially broken shells. Diet
   composition in terms of biomass can be estimated by a two-step
   procedure. First, the diet composition in terms of ash or shell mass is
   estimated on the basis of the sieved mass of droppings. The application
   of the site-, season- and size-specific ratios of biomass/shell mass or
   biomass/ash mass then provides a breakdown of diet with respect to
   biomass. An exploratory field study in the Wadden Sea showed that
   measurable fragments in (rarely encountered) regurgitates overestimate
   prey size. According to the faecal analysis, there was a seasonal change
   in diet from bivalves to mudsnails with the approach of winter. In
   combination with field measurements of defecation rates, the outlined
   methodology may allow the use of droppings as indicators of intake
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{A sample survey of Hen Harriers in 1988-89 was based on 10-km squares
   according to their category of proof of breeding in 1968-72. From this
   sample the Scottish population was estimated at 570+/-150 pairs with
   95\% confidence. Seventy-one pairs were found on Orkney and 389 proved
   or probable pairs and a further 139 possibles were located elsewhere.
   About 60 pairs nested in England and Wales. An expansion of range since
   1968-72 is mapped. Numbers have fallen on some grouse moor study areas.
   Nesting success on grouse moors was only 14\% compared with 40\% on
   other heather moors and 66\% in young conifer plantations. Many of these
   failures on grouse moors were due to human persecution and by
   conservative estimates, 30-80 breeding adult birds were illegally killed
   each summer.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial establishment of Wood Warblers was studied during 5 years in
   1800 ha of forest in central Belgium. The total population size varied
   dramatically between years, with maximum of 167 and a minimum of 56 male
   territories. The spatial distribution of territories within the forest
   also differed greatly between years. Most territories were associated in
   clusters or chains, which were not located at the same sites every year.
   Females preferred males that were closer to other males, and
   re-productive output tended to be higher under this condition.
   These results could fit the optimal habitat choice hypothesis, but at
   variance with this concept, areas with huge infestations of caterpillars
   were not found to contain many Wood Warbler territories. A direct social
   advantage of clustering is suggested as an alternative hypothesis. Males
   outnumber females in some Western European populations of Wood Warblers,
   and males clearly improved their chances of attracting a female by
   aggregating in `supersexy' communal units. Males that remain unpaired
   can only reproduce by promiscuous behaviour, which is also facilitated
   by closer territories.}},

Abstract = {{Polygyny was studied for 4 years in a central Spanish montane population
   of Pied Flycatchers. The frequency of Polygyny was low (4.4\%) and
   limited to two females per male. Bigamous males only differed from
   monogamous males in that they were older. Secondary females had a lower
   reproductive success and their surviving nestlings were smaller and
   undernourished, probably due to the absence of the male during most of
   the early nestling period. Primary and secondary nests were separated by
   short distances, which makes it hard to explain the mating system by
   male `cheating' or female-female aggression. Secondary females were
   mainly young inexperienced birds which might not otherwise have bred in

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the distribution of Lapwings Vanellus vanellus and
   Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria in Britain and Ireland during the
   1981/82, 1982/83 and 1983/84 winters, using data from The Atlas of
   Wintering Birds in Britain and Ireland and the Birds of Estuaries
   Enquiry. In the cold weather of 1981/82, the overall abundance of both
   species declined rapidly in early December, a period of sharply
   decreasing temperatures, and we consider that many birds probably left
   Brtain and Ireland altogether.However, both species remained relatively
   abundant along the south coast of England at this time. When
   temperatures increased in late December and early January, Lapwings
   became more abundant in Britain and the northern parts of Ireland,
   though this was short-lived and numbers declined again when temperatures
   fell in the second week of January. Both 1982/83 and 1983/84 were
   relatively mild winters, and the distribution of both species remained
   approximately constant through both. Only in February 1983, when cold
   weather again prevailed, were there marked reductions in both species in
   their strongholds in eastern Britain. In all three winters, Lapwings
   were more abundant in Britain than in Ireland, but Golden Plovers were
   more abundant in Ireland. Possible reasons for this are discussed.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-62}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Estimates of rates of Magpie predation on Blackbird nests were made
   using plasticine eggs added to active clutches. Breeding densities of
   Blackbirds were lower than those recorded at other urban sites while
   Magpie densities were higher than those previously recorded in urban
   areas. Fewer than 5\% of Blackbird nests produced flegded young.
   Predation caused most of the failures where a cause was known, though
   most nests failed for unknown reasons. Of identified predation, the
   majority was attributable to Magpies. The characteristics of predation
   where nest contents were removed suggest that these can probably also be
   attributed to Magpies. Given their high densities in urban areas and a
   lack of evidence of other predators, Magpies appear to provide the main
   predation pressure on Blackbird nests.
   At such low nesting success rates, the results from the present study
   suggest that Blackbird populations in urban parkland would be unlikely
   to maintain themselves. In this study, the breeding populations of
   Blackbirds were probably sustained by immigration from other habitats.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of 3803 records of nest sites used by Kestrels from 1937 to
   1987 showed that cliffs, crags and quarries comprised 27\% of the total,
   abandoned stick nests in trees 17\%, tree cavities 20\%, buildings 16\%
   and nest boxes 15\%. There were strong regional variations in the
   distribution of these sites. Frequency of use of different types may
   have been partly influenced by nest predation rates. Stick nests were
   mainly used in trees in forests, woods, copses, clumps or belts of
   trees, and 83\% of such nests were those of Carrion Crows; 45\% of the
   trees were pines. Height influenced the choice of stick nests used by
   Kestrels, lower nests generally being avoided. There was a continual
   decline in the proportion stick nests used during the period, whilst the
   use of tree cavities increased. Tree cavities were mainly used in
   hedgerow, park and isolated trees, and their use was linked to the
   extent of tilled farmland in any area. This pattern was perhaps partly
   encouraged by modern cultivation techniques, but probably mainly
   resulted from changing human attitudes to farmland trees. The tree
   species used for cavity nesting by Kestrels differed markedly from those
   used by owls, and choice of cavity also showed some differences. There
   was a remarkable concentration of Kestrel nest sites in rural buildings
   in NW England, a pattern apparently increasing. This may have been
   linked to the types of farm buildings there. The sites used in buildings
   differed from those used by Barn Owls.}},

   mean of 36-51 g, about 14-18 and 10-13\% of male and female harrier
   weights, respectively. A male harrier ate (or discarded) about 10\% of
   the prey before delivery, about 9\% of his own body weight. The
   frequency of prey deliveries varied after hatching within and between
   males, and was linked to brood size. There was no uniform pattern to
   daily delivery times.}},

Abstract = {{We collected data on activity patterns (brood attendance, durations of
   feeding trips and feeding rates) of parent Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla
   and the food fed to chicks in 2 breeding seasons at the same colony. In
   1989, trip duration increased markedly towards the end of the nestling
   period. Pairs attempted to increase the feeding rate of their young by
   both adults foraging simultaneously rather than alternately. This
   response was more pronounced in pairs with two chicks (b/2s), i.e. those
   with greater food requirements. Estimates of the energy value of food
   delivered by the pair to the brood suggested that, particularly for b/2s
   at the end of the season, amounts were insufficient to meet the chicks'
   requirements. However, despite this shortfall most chicks survived to
   fledging. In 1990, Kittiwakes fed their young on smaller sandeels
   Ammodytes spp which had a lower energy density than those in 1989.
   Feeding rates were also low. We estimated that for most of the chick
   rearing period energy intakes for the young were below those required.
   Breeding success was only 0.17 chicks fledged/completed nest, the lowest
   value for at least 10 years.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1982 and 1991 Green Sandpipers were studied in mid-Hertfordshire
   through regular counts and observations of colour-ringed birds. Birds
   were present in the study area in every month of the year but only in
   low numbers during May. Overall, throughout the year, 35.1\% of the
   birds were found at gravel pit complexes and 37.8\% at disused
   watercress beds. There was a marked shift from gravel pits in summer and
   autumn to disused watercress beds and stream sides in winter.
   Colour-ringing showed that the population consisted mainly of birds
   which regularly spent the winter in the area; the overall return rate
   from one winter to the next was 83.5\%. Individual birds changed sites
   between autumn and winter in a similar way to the population as a whole
   and, in mid-winter, were extremely faithful to particular sites to which
   they returned each year. The return rates from one winter to the next
   are negatively correlated with the number of nights with air frost in
   the first winter.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of wildfowl using the lakes at the Great Linford gravel pit
   complex (300 ha) in winter, in two 5-year periods in the 1970s and
   1980s, were compared. Species emphasis changed from predominately
   dabbling ducks in the earlier period, when most lakes were newly
   flooded, to greater numbers of submerged macrophyte feeders in the later
   period. Diving duck numbers were little changed and competition for food
   from high populations of stocked coarse fish is suggested as a factor
   limiting lake use by birds which feed on benthic invertebrates.
   There was a large increase in numbers of wildfowl using a 17 ha lake
   after the fish populations were removed in November 1987. Use by
   herbivorous species, Mute Swan, Coot and Gadwall, increased dramatically
   in response to new weed growth. Shoveler and Pochard numbers both
   increased significantly and more Tufted Duck were counted. It is
   suggested that these changes were related to demonstrated increases in
   benthic invertebrates post-fish removal.
   The implications for manipulating both new and maturing gravel pit lakes
   are discussed; fish removal is suggested as a useful technique for
   managing wetland nature reserves.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum count of Greenland White-fronted Geese wintering at Wexford,
   south-east Ireland (where over a third of the population winters)
   increased from 7910 in 1984/85 to 9530 in 1989/90. Although the
   population tends to be highly site-loyal on the wintering grounds, 14\%
   of 700 marked geese seen in two consecutive winters changed site. Counts
   elsewhere in the wintering range and the recorded movements of marked
   birds indicate that a large influx of geese from Scotland to Wexford
   occurred in 1988/89. In the previous and subsequent winters large
   numbers of geese from Wexford remained in Scotland. No sex-related
   difference in birds changing site could be detected, but 68\% of
   known-age birds which moved did so in their second and third winters
   when pairing is most frequent. Only 39 marked geese were recorded moving
   within winters (an average of 2.8\% of the population each year),
   virtually all of these involved geese staging on route to or from
   wintering sites within Britain and Ireland. The maximum numbers are
   reached at Wexford in January/February when marked birds arrive from
   more northerly staging areas within Britain and Ireland.}},

   Falco tinnunculus which hunted Pipistrelle Bats Pipistrellus
   pipistrellus at dusk on 11 of 15 days of observation. Bats left their
   roosts earlier, and in greater numbers, during fine weather (i.e. high
   air pressure, no rainfall and low wind speed). The Kestrel showed no
   interest in bats during poor weather and went to roost early, even
   though some bats were flying. From pellet analysis, we estimated that
   bats represented between 30\% and 60\% of the items eaten by this
   Kestrel.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Distribution and abundance of breeding birds were examined in 62 ha of
   ancient, actively coppiced, woodland in relation to vegetation and age
   of the coppice. The composition of bird communities in coppice of 3-8
   years of growth was distinctly different to that in other ages of
   coppice. Most warblers, Nightingale and Dunnock strongly selected
   coppice < 10 years. No species selected older coppice. Migrant songbird
   species were almost entirely associated with coppice < 10 years. Total
   density of songbirds was lowest in very young (< 3 years) and old
   coppice (> 11 years). Most of these distribution patterns were best
   explained by variations in the density of the shrub layer or by a
   combination of relatively low tree height yet high canopy cover. At the
   scale of the entire wood there was little evidence that tree species
   composition affected bird distribution. However, within young (3-8
   years) and within old (10-30 years) coppice there was evidence of tree
   species effects. It is argued that subtle patterns in woodland bird
   communities will be masked by responses of birds to large variation in
   habitat structure; this aspect of scale is rarely considered in the
   design or interpretation of studies of bird-habitat relationships.}},

   examined for weight, visible fat deposition and actual fat load using a
   Soxhlet extraction. From the amount of fat deposited, mean theoretical
   flight ranges were calculated. Visible stored fat is only deposited in
   large quantities towards the end of the migration period. Before
   migration, the mean fat content stored in relation to fat-free dry
   weight ranges from 9-12 \%, whereas during migration it ranges from
   13-30\%. There is no difference between long- and short-distance
   migrants. A weight change cannot be accounted for exclusively by fat
   deposition. The mean weight of first-captures was low in all species.
   Only 5 of the 11 species studied gained weight more or less extensively
   during the migration period. All species showed an increase in fat
   deposition during migration. Since 1972, a marked annual decrease in
   average body weight during migration was found in the Reed Warbler. On
   average, water content in relation to fat-free dry weight is between 208
   and 254\% during migration and between 216 and 270\% during the
   pre-migration period. For the species studied at Mettnau, mean
   theoretical flight range is 49 to 85 km during the pre-migration period
   and 84 to 216 km during migration (n = 211 birds). An average flight
   range of up to 100 km implies short migrational `legs' from Lake
   Constance to the nearby Swiss midlands, which is probable if only parts
   of the small fat reserves are utilized during their flight. Because
   birds have to increase their initial fat stores considerably to reach
   and cross the Mediterranean, a low fat deposition rate may lead to
   problems before they reach their winter quarters. Short flight ranges
   are discussed in connection with trends of decreasing populations in
   central Europe.}},

   studied at Lough Hyne Marine Reserve, Ireland. All prey items cached
   were obtained from the intertidal zone and Mussels Mytilus edulis were
   the most frequently recovered prey species. The methods used to cache
   intertidal prey species were similar to that previously described for
   other species in the genus Corvus. Mussels were cached on a falling tide
   and usually recovered by crows within 2-3 days. Mussels were recovered
   during high tide and this behaviour was a response to short-term, daily

   in a few cases the difference between point counts and round counts
   increased with the complexity of the shore vegetation. Between-species
   differences in habitat use obtained from point counts and round counts

Abstract = {{To compare the breeding bird communities, counts were made at a total of
   408 points in 482 ha of oak plantations and 641 ha of ancient pasture
   woodlands of the New Forest. Thirty-three species were recorded in each
   woodLand type and the overall breeding bird density was similar in each,
   with Blue Tit and Chaffinch the most abundant species. Measurements at
   each point showed significant habitat differences between the 2 woodland
   types although there was much overlap and, particularly in the
   plantations, considerable variation in structure. The habitat variables
   were used to distinguish those points where the structure was typical of
   the plantations from those where the structure was more characteristic
   of the pasture woodlands. Seven species were more numerous in areas
   where the structure was typical of the plantations (Blue Tit, Chaffinch,
   Robin, Treecreeper, Coal Tit, Blackbird and Mistle Thrush) and three
   species (Great Tit, Willow Warbler and Jackdaw) were more numerous in
   typical pasture woodlands. Estimates of the volume of dead wood were
   made at each point but, with the possible exception of Redstart, no
   species were found to be strongly associated with this.}},

Abstract = {{A classification system for coding the habitats of British and Irish
   birds has been designed for use in `extensive' ecological studies, i.e.
   where data are contributed by many observers.  The system is based
   mainly on the vegetation structure of habitats and requires no expert
   botanical knowledge.  It has advantages over several existing habitat
   classifications because it embraces agricultural and man-made sites as
   well as semi-natural ones, and it also includes aspects of
   land-management and human activity.  The system described in this paper
   has, however, been designed to be as fully compatible as possible with
   other widely-used classifications.  It has been implemented within the
   BTO Nest Record Scheme and its use will be extended throughout the BTO's
   Integrated Population Monitoring Programme.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1961 the Northumbria Ringing Group has monitored a population of
   Merlins breeding in Kielder Forest, Northumberland.  Prior to 1979
   Merlins bred at traditionally used sites mostly on the ground in
   Heather.  In 1979 the first nest was located in a crows' nest along the
   moorland edge of a young Sitka Spruce plantation.  This nesting habit
   has increased, and by 1990 over 50\% of the population were breeding in
   crows' nests in conifers.  This switch in the type of nest sites has
   coincided with large areas of forests reaching an age suitable for crows
   to nest in.  Merlins breeding in conifer forests had similar clutch
   sizes to those using traditional ground nests, but in conifer sites,
   brood sizes were 70\% larger.  Throughout the course of this study
   (1978-90) the Merlin population increased by 71\% to 24 pairs in 1990. 
   A low point was reached in 1982/83 when only 10-11 pairs bred, after
   this tree-nesting increased and so did the population.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes an analysis of 409 breeding records of Nuthatches
   Sitta europaea from nestboxes in 13 study areas in West Germany over 16
   years.  We found one true second brood and eight replacement broods. 
   Mean date of first egg was 19 April, mean clutch size 6.49 eggs and mean
   number of fledglings per clutch 5.14.  Seventy-six per cent of all
   clutches produced fledglings.  We found habitat effects on laying date
   and clutch size but not number of fledglings, and the patterns were not
   consistent with literature data on habitat-related breeding success and
   habitat selection.  Clutch size decreased with laying date but only in
   early clutches.  In heterogeneous habitats older birds bred earlier than
   young birds, which suggests a relationship with territory quality.  All
   aspects of breeding success and laying date varied between years. 
   Breeding success was higher if rainfall in March was high and population
   density low.  The latter relationship may be indicative of
   density-related variation in territory quality.}},

Abstract = {{Because Gulls have been considered to reduce Avocet breeding success,
   the behaviour of Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus and Avocets
   Recurvirostra avosetta at Havergate Island, Suffolk, was analysed in
   order to compare the effects of two methods of Gull productivity
   control, (a) formalin injection of eggs and (b) nest raking.  Of four
   lagoons, two were controlled by each method in a simple experimental
   design.  Gulls breeding on different lagoons behaved similarly prior to
   control, although Avocets showed no such consistent pattern.  During the
   period 0-60 min after control Gulls were significantly more active on
   the `raked' lagoons than on those where clutches were injected, in which
   they returned to their nests.  This difference between lagoons was
   long-lasting - Gulls from `raked' lagoons showed significantly more
   disturbed behaviour and exhibited a greater frequency of aggression,
   both interspecific and intraspecific, during the 2-month period of the
   experiment.  There were no determinable effects of treamtment on Avocet
   behaviour, although Avocets breeding on lagoons where Gull clutches had
   been raked, returned to their nests more quickly once disturbance by the
   controllers had ceased, than did birds from lagoons where gull eggs were
   injected.  In Black-headed Gulls rates of intraspecific aggression
   through the study period were higher than rates of interspecific
   aggression.  In Avocets the reverse was true.  It was not our aim in
   this study to investigate the treatment on Avocet productivity.}},

   colony growth occurred in 1974-76 and 1985-86, when numbers dropped to
   46\% and 79\% respectively of the pre-crash level.  In both cases, the
   crashes were associated with late breeding, low chick production and
   poor first-year survival rates.  Attendance of breeders at the colony
   and timing of breeding were linked to Herring abundance around the
   island in February and (timing only) to the number of days of easterly
   winds in March.  Annual chick production and first-year survival rates
   were each positively related to local Herring abundance and to the mean
   size of sandeels collected by Puffins rearing chicks on the island, but
   not to overall sandeel biomass in the southern North Sea.  Simulation
   modelling showed that in both crash periods, a proportion of Shags that
   had bred in a previous year did not breed; the exact proportion depended
   on the amount of recruitment, and ranged from 10\% to 60\% in the years
   when it occurred.  With up to 25\% of Shags not breeding at least once
   in their lifetime after having recruited to the colony, such
   non-breeding behaviour constitutes a standard feature of Shag biology,
   probably as an adaptation to maximizing lifetime reproductive success in
   an annually fluctuating environment.}},

Abstract = {{The weights and measurements of almost 7000 Teal captured in Abberton
   Reservoir, Essex during 1969-85 were analysed.  Teal showed significant
   differences between the first year and adult birds and between males and
   females in tarsus and wing length, but significant differences only
   between the sexes in skull length.  Weights were corrected for body size
   using wing length to give a condition index.  The index of condition
   increased in all age and sex classes from September to reach maximum
   values late in the year, before falling to lowest levels in February. 
   Female birds show more marked responses by the reduction in January
   condition index to hard weather than males and, indeed, the proportion
   of females caught at Abberton significantly declines with increasing
   severity of weather conditions.  The significance of these sex related
   responses are discussed in the light of known features of the ecology of
   the species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of climate and habitat structure as
   predictors of the richness of birds breeding in the forests of the
   Iberian Peninsula.  Mean richness of passerines was counted in 48 large
   woodlands distributed along a 850 km belt crossing the Iberian
   Peninsula.  It was correlated with mean scores of climatic
   (temperatures, precipitation, evapotranspiration) and physiognomic
   (trunk density, tree age structure and trunk diversity) variables. 
   Simple correlation analysis showed the importance of both climatic
   (temperature and evapotranspiration, positively correlated) and
   structural (trunk density, negatively correlated) variables in
   predicting bird diversity.  The importance of climate vanished, however,
   when the problem of interaction between variables was solved with
   passerine richness.  These results seem to show the prevalence of forest
   structure as a predictor of bird diversity along the studied gradient.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of placing peanut feeders at different

   Food consumption at feeders adjacent to cover was approximately double
   that of feeders 7.5 m away.  Blue Tits Parus caeruleus and particularly
   House Sparrows Passer domesticus showed a strong tendency to use those
   feeders closest to cover, while further ones were used predominantly by
   Greenfinches Carduelis chloris.  Feeders were also placed at 4 different
   distances from housing and food consumption increased with distance. 
   The proportion of the total use made by Siskins Carduelis spinus was
   equal at all 4 feeders, but Greenfinches made increasing use of feeders
   the further they were from housing.  We suggest how the siting of
   feeders may affect the species of bird that are attracted to them.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1986 and 1988 data on the nesting densities, productivity, and
   survival of breeding Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus were collected from 5
   study sites in the Northern Isles of Shetland.  Nesting densities on
   sites varied between 11 and 21 pairs per 100 ha.  Few studies elsewhere
   have recorded such high densities of nesting Whimbrel as those on
   certain sites used in the present study.  Each breeding pair produced an
   average of between 0.75 and 0.91 fledglings per year.  Productivity
   varied considerably between different study sites however, primarily
   because of differences in the survival rate of chicks between hatching
   and fledging (ranging from 3\% to 55\% in one year).  The annual
   survival rate of breeding adults was at least 89\%.  Considering adult
   survival in relation to overall productivity, it appears likely that the
   production of fledglings from study sites is in excess of that required
   to balance adult mortality.  This result is consistent with the current
   increase of the Whimbrel population in Shetland.}},

   BRITAIN AND IRELAND}},

Abstract = {{Previous published information on the migratory and pre-migratory
   movements of Swallows Hirundo rustica in Britain and Ireland was based
   on 191 birds ringed up to 1965 and found within the same autumn.  By
   1988, this number had increased to 3337.  In view of recent interest in
   the migratory strategies and conservation of Swallows in Britain, this
   expanded data base has now been analysed.  Particular attention is paid
   to the speed, distance, direction and timing of movements shown by 468
   ringed birds which were found between July and November within 10 days
   of ringing at least 5 km from the ringing site.
   First-year birds showed pronouned non-directional wandering during
   August, but became increasingly oriented to the south-east from
   September onwards.  Movements to the north and west were, on average,
   25-38 km within 10 days, but some were up to 270 km.  Eight out of 20
   adult movements were also westward or northwards for up to 43 km.  Data
   from all birds combined showed evidence that birds from easterly regions
   used easterly routes through Britain, and those from westerly regions
   used westerly routes.
   The speeds and distances of movements within Britain and within 10 days
   changed significantly with month of ringing and direction of movement. 
   Flights to the south-east were longest and fastest at averages up to 71
   km in one day (maximum 194 km per day).  However, there was evidence
   that movements were not uniform on a day-to-day basis, since apparent
   speeds declined with time after ringing to averages of 2-26 km per d
   over 10 days.  Increased speeds during September and October to the
   south-east probably reflected both longer flights per day, and a
   decreased tendency to loiter from day-to-day.  These aspects of the
   migratory strategy are discussed in relation to the moderate
   pre-migratory fattening shown by British Swallows from September
   onwards.
   Movements between roost sites showed a stronger south-east orientation
   than unspecified movements, reflecting the use of roosts during
   migration.  Movements between roosts in one day averaged 27 km, though
   overall roost to roots journeys of 1-10 days were made at an average of
   10 km per day.  These features are discussed in relation to the
   conservation value of an appropriate network of Swallow roosts.}},

   of the Birds of Estuaries Enquiry.  These were compared with counts made
   by us at low water on the adjacent inshore mud- and sandflats.
   Of 45 comparisons made, 13 differed by less than 25\%, 20 by 26-50\% and
   12 by more than 50\%.  The high water count exceeded the low water count
   in 25 comparisons.  Counts of Shelduck, Oystercatcher and Knot were the
   most consistent.  Most discrepancies appeared to be due to either an
   inability to count all areas at low water or by birds, and sometimes
   roosts, being missed.
   The correspondence between counts was generally good, given the size of
   the Wash, the disparity in methods used and the number of counters
   involved.  Since most discrepancies were due to omissions, the results
   support the BTO practice of using peak counts to assess an estuary's
   importance.}},

Abstract = {{The fruit diets of Sylvia warblers, and some thrushes, were studied
   during 1989 at a coastal scrubland site, using faecal examination. 
   Fruit feeding commenced as the earliest berries ripened in late July,
   but there were differences of timing between species.  Amongst both
   warblers and thrushes, the larger species commenced earlier and ate more
   fruit.  Almost all Blackcap and Garden Warbler faeces examined from
   early August contained some fruit remains, as did most Whitethroat
   faeces from mid-month.  Mean fruit contents of faecal samples exceeded
   80\% infrequently, indicating that even the most frugivorous species
   always took other food, normally insects, to supplement their diet. 
   Each species differed in their fruit diet:  Blackcaps, and to a lesser
   extent Garden Warblers, ate Woody Nightshade berries in preference to
   Blackberries, as they are structurally adapted for feeding on the former
   plant.  Only inexperienced juveniles of other species regularly chose
   the Nightshade berries.  Elder berries, abundant from late August,
   became the preferred fruit for all Sylvia species.  Using data from an
   earlier investigation,1 it is shown that by feeding on Elder berries,
   migrating Blackcaps can obtain 75-90\% of their daily energy
   requirements in 10\% of daylight hours.}},

   Buzzard and Lesser Black-backed Gull.  Each species' frequency at
   visiting carrion was not directly related to the abundance of the

   competition, distance to roosts, and the economic return obtained from
   eating carrion.  These species were not social at carrion, aggression
   often taking place among them.  Large sized species dominated smaller

   Nest Record Scheme and The Game Conservancy's Pheasant Nest Recording
   Scheme (PNRS) were analysed.  Mean clutch size was 11.4 and hatchability
   of eggs averaged 86\%.  Daily rates of clutch loss were 2-3 times higher
   on the day following the nest being discovered, associated with an
   increased rate of abandonment.  After this, daily rates of loss during
   laying were 0.070 and 0.114 and losses during incubation were 0.015 and
   0.028 from the PNRS and BTO samples, respectively.  Calculations suggest
   that 53\% and 25\% of females successfully produced a brood from the
   PNRS and BTO samples, respectively.  The figure from the BTO sample is
   probably too low to sustain a population.  It is suggested that the low
   rate of brood production is caused by the widescale release of
   handreared birds which are known to breed poorly.}},

Abstract = {{Attendance by male Black Grouse was studied at 4 leks in north Wales in
   spring 1987 and 1988.  The number of males at individual leks varied
   depending on time of day and season.  The highest counts were obtained
   in April and early May, 1 hr either side of sunrise.  Counts were also
   made on 45 of the 91 recorded display sites in north Wales, mainly
   between 04.00-05.00 hours in May 1988 and the results compared with data
   collected in 1986.  Twenty-nine per cent of sites had more males in
   1988, 47\% had fewer males and 24\% were unchanged.  Overall, numbers
   had apparently increased by 4\% but this did not necessarily reflect
   changes in the population.  Leks in forests had declined more than those
   on moorland.  Recommendations are made for standardizing survey
   methodology and for monitoring Black Grouse populations in Wales.}},

Abstract = {{The habitat preferences of the Dunnock Prunella modularis, and their
   seasonal dependence, were studied in an area on the west side of
   Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.  Preferences were determined from
   counts on transects in suburban gardens, deciduous woodland, coniferous
   woodland, farmland and moorland in both summer and winter.  Dunnocks
   were found throughout the study area, even on open moorland and conifer
   plantations more than 300 m above sea level.  In addition a wide, but
   inexplicable, year to year variation was observed in the number of birds
   found in deciduous woodland.  The number of registrations per km varied
   significantly between habitats, with the highest count occurring in
   gardens.  However, no statistically significant changes in the
   proportion of birds in each habitat were detected between summer and

Abstract = {{Observations carried out on an Acrocephalus community in north-western
   Italy during the breeding period have confirmed the occurrence of
   interspecific territoriality, with Acrocephalus arundinaceus
   aggressively dominant toward A. scirpaceus and A. palustris.  The
   adaptive character of such an interspecific territoriality is discussed.
   Data seem to suggest that shifts in territories are also depending on
   interspecific interactions, even though intraspecific interactions have
   been confirmed to have the major weight in such a phenomenon.  Great
   Reed Warbler territories resulted to be significantly larger than those
   of Marsh and Reed Warbler.  It may be supposed that the Great Reed
   Warbler has larger territories as a consequence of its stronger
   aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding data for Merlins on the Cambrian Mountains Environmentally
   Sensitive Area in central Wales are presented for the years 1970-89. 
   The population prior to 1986 is not accurately known; but from 1970-75
   was at least 5-10 pairs and probably 10-20 pairs.  After this time pairs
   switched nest sites from traditional moorland trees to the edges of
   conifer plantations, and, because these latter nest areas were not
   checked for occupancy until 1986, the population over the last 10 years
   may have declined as in other areas or simply switched nest site, or
   both.  The limited evidence suggests that the population has remained
   stable or may have declined slightly.  Between 1986 and 1989, the
   population was 10-20 pairs, the highest recorded population of the three
   survey periods.  Over 90\% of these were breeding in conifer plantation
   edges.  The nest site switch involved a significant increase of altitude
   of up to 200 m, but there was a tendency for nest areas to be located
   close to the old upland valley nest areas.  Judgement should be reserved
   as to the relative importance of grass and heather-dominated moorland to
   breeding Merlins.  If the 1986-89 data are true for the whole of Wales,
   the present population is at least 60-70 pairs, significantly higher
   than the 1982-84 estimate of 40-45 pairs, but similar to the figure for
   the 1970s.  The use of commercial forestry plantations as nest sites
   requires further study throughout Britain.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding distribution of Pochard on two flooded gravel pits was
   studied at the ARC Wildfowl Centre in January/February 1989, when peak
   wintering numbers were present.  On the deeper lake (mean depth 2.3 m)
   99\% of feeding occurred in the shallowest 10\% of the lake, where depth
   averaged 1.6 m.  In the other shallower lake (mean depth 1.5 m) favoured
   feeding areas averaged 0.9 m deep.  At this lake only 15\% of the
   available habitat at this depth was used by feeding Pochard, much
   shallow water being ignored.  Benthic sampling produced no submerged
   macrophytes and revealed that only oligochaete worms and chironomid
   larvae were numerous in the sediments.  Oligochaetes were similarly
   distributed in both feeding and non-feeding areas.  Chironomid larvae
   were present in significantly higher numbers and biomass/m2 in feeding
   areas.  Hence it would appear that Pochard prefer to feed in shallow
   water and can select prey-rich areas, thus maximizing their food intake
   whilst minimizing their energy expenditure.  Two out of 3 Pochard shot
   at the site in December 1989 which had food present in their upper
   digestive tracts contained only (large) chironomid larvae.  The
   Pochard's ability to exploit patches rich in chironomid larvae is
   discussed in relation to the relatively low nutrient status of flooded
   gravel pits.}},

Abstract = {{Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiacus were introduced to Britain from
   Africa in the seventeen century and were widely distributed by the
   eighteenth and nineteenth century.  Their distribution in Britain is now
   mainly restricted to Norfolk.  In the breeding season 144 pairs were
   located and the population was estimated to be about 400 birds. 
   Breeding birds were restricted to sites with open water, short grass and
   suitable nesting sites (either islands, holes in old trees or amongst
   epicormic shoots on old trees).  There is a moult migration to Holkham
   Hall which has a moulting flock of about 150 birds.  During the winter
   they are widely dispersed within river valleys where they feed on short
   grass and cereals.  The population size seems to have changed little
   over the last one and a half centuries, but there is some evidence of a
   localized increase and spread of range over recent years.  The
   productivity of fledged young is low.}},

   density of fish (< 20 cm, measured as the mean number of fish per catch

   transparency and location of nest sites were investigated through
   multiple regression analyses.  For the period of incubation, hatching
   and feeding of small young (end of May-June) the analyses did not reveal
   any clear patterns, but indicated that presence of G. stellata was
   related to large lake surface area and presence of Acerina cernua, and
   G. arctica to high water transparency.  During July (feeding of
   medium-sized to large young), G. stellata primarily occurred in lakes
   with high density of cyprinid fish or Acerina cernua, and located close
   to breeding lakes.  The distribution of G. arctica foraging alone or in
   pairs was related to high shoreline development, whereas the occurrence
   of birds fishing in groups to high density of Perca fluviatilis.  G.
   stellata is presumed to be more susceptible than G. arctica to the

Abstract = {{This paper describes a measure of protein reserves for small passerines
   based on the shape of the pectoral muscle, and tests its validity in a
   population of the Great Tit.  It also tests the hypothesis that arrested
   moult of greater-coverts in juvenile Great Tits reflects protein stress
   at the time of moult.  Of first year females 40.9\% showed arrested
   moult while 17.9\% of males did.  This difference was highly
   significant.  In females unmoulted greater-coverts correlated
   significantly and negatively with the pectoral muscle score observed in
   winter.  There was no similarity between daughters and their mothers in
   the number of unmoulted coverts, although they showed a weak resemblance
   to their fathers.  It is suggested that this may be due to shared
   environment rather than genetic inheritance.  Females declined in weight
   through the breeding season, and also declined in protein reserves while
   feeding a brood.  Male muscle scores declined through the breeding
   season (between-individual variation implied) but not while feeding a

Abstract = {{Aspects of the biology of Snow Buntings wintering in Britain are
   reported, based on captures of live birds at three sites in the north of
   Scotland, sightings of colour-ringed birds, museum skins and national
   ringing recoveries. Overall females outnumbered males at all three sites
   and in all seasons; the percentage of females, however, varied
   appreciably (range 52-76 \%). About 80\% of birds caught were of the
   Icelandic race, P.n.insulae, and it is suggested that the majority of
   the Snow Buntings wintering in northern Scotland, and probably the whole
   of Britain, originate from here. Ringing recoveries, including three
   Icelandic-ringed nestlings or recently fledged juveniles caught in
   Caithness during the study, unequivocably establish the presence of
   Icelandic birds in Britain. The remaining 20\% of birds were of the
   nominate race, P.n.nivalis, and evidence is presented that these
   originated from both Scandinavia and Greenland. Movements within Britian
   and between Britain and the Low Countries are also described.}},

Abstract = {{A survery of the numbers, distribution and habitat preferences of
   breeding Lapwings in England and Wales was conducted by members of the
   British Trust for Ornithology in spring (April) 1987. One randomly
   selected tetrad was surveyed in each 10-km square of the National Grid
   which contained any land. A total of 123 134 pairs was estimated, with
   95\% confidence limits of about 110 000 and 138 000 (derived from 2
   bootstrap methods). There was a marked concentration in northwest
   England with very few in Wales or the southwest peninsula. In total,
   96\% of birds were found in farmland with spring-tilled fields the
   preferred nesting habitat. Autumn-sown fields were consistently avoided.
   The preferences for grass were more variable although leys were the
   least preferred grass type, and there was a greater preference for grass
   in regions in which there was only a small area compared to tillage,
   showing that a mixture of spring tillage and grass is the best farming
   system for breeding Lapwings. Grazed grass was preferred to ungrazed.
   The results were compared with two earlier national surveys, in 1937 and
   1960, and the patterns are discussed, especially with respect to changes
   in farming practices.}},

   Cyanopica cyana were studied in 1986 in central Spain. Preferred nest
   sites were a non-random subset of the available habitat. Nests built on
   evergreen trees had significantly earlier clutch initiation dates than
   those built on deciduous trees. Birds selected larger trees of each
   species for nesting, but nests built on very high trees had
   significantly lower nesting success. Birds tended to locate their nests
   in a central position relative to the canopy height and as far from the
   main trunk as possible, without being of the periphery. This may
   minimize nest accessibility and maximize concealment. Nesting success
   was higher in the preferred regions of the tree canopy. Predation and
   inclement weather were probably the factors selecting for the observed
   patterns in nest-site distribution.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of reports of Buzzard persecution in Britain using data
   collated by the RSPB for the period 1975 to 1989 revealed records of 238
   Buzzards that had been killed illegally.  A comparison with the results
   of the 1981 BTO Buzzard survey showed that Buzzards are significantly
   more likely to be reported dead through persecution on the edge of their
   range in Britain compared with the middle of the range.  Of all reported
   deaths, 39\% occurred in March and April, and were largely attributable
   to the misuse of poisons.  Three main poisons regularly killed Buzzards;
   alpha-chloralose, mevinphos and strychnine.  During the period of the
   analysis, the number of Buzzards illegally killed and reported annually
   did not show any decrease.  Persecution is still considered a factor
   likely to be contributing to the restriction of the Buzzard's range in
   Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Winter bird communities, sampled by transect methods, were compared
   between 9 woodland sites (1 ungrazed oak, 4 grazed oak, 4 grazed
   conifer) in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire, during 2 winters
   (1984/85 and 1987/88).  Ungrazed oak woodland had the highest counts of
   individual birds in both years.  More species occurred in oak woods than
   in conifers.  Ordination of the combined data from the 2 winters
   illustrated a consistent gradient of bird species composition (after the
   exclusion of 2 flocking species, Woodpigeon and Chaffinch), from
   evergreen coniferous to deciduous broadleaf.  Green and Great-spotted
   Wood-pecker, Hawfinch, Fieldfare, Brambling, Great Tit, Magpie and
   Siskin occurred largely towards the deciduous broadleaf end of the
   gradient.  Classification of the bird data split the sites firstly into
   deciduous broadleaf and evergreen coniferous.  In further sub-divisions,
   one group had tree species composition consisting largely of ungrazed
   oak for which the indicator bird species was Hawfinch.  The indicator
   species of the grazed conifer group were Blue Tit, Goldcrest, Coal Tit
   and Long-tailed Tit.  The tree species composition for the 5 final
   groups was then related to the number of bird species in them.  In both
   years the mean number of species in the groups increased with an
   increase of the dominance of oak with the highest value in ungrazed oak.
   The implications of the development of further ungrazed areas for
   conservation purposes are discussed.}},
