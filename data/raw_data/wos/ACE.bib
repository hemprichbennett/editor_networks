Abstract = {{Most hummingbird species are distributed in tropical lowlands and
   mountains with few species reaching the alpine environments of high
   mountain peaks. Field surveys were conducted in nine alpine sites across
   four of the highest volcanoes in central Mexico for three years to
   document hummingbird occurrence, habitat use, and some aspects of
   behavior. We also searched through historical museum collections and
   online databases to document early records of hummingbirds in Mexican
   alpine habitats. In addition, we conducted a search through historical
   herbarium collections of ornithophilous plant species in alpine
   habitats, and a literature search on glacier retreats in Mexico to
   establish past and present elevational limits of alpine vegetation. We
   recorded the presence of four hummingbird species using floral resources
   across the nine study sites: Cynanthus latirostris (Broad-billed
   Hummingbird), Hylocharis leucotis (White-eared Hummingbird), Lampornis
   clemenciae (Blue-throated Hummingbird), and Selasphorus platycercus
   (Broad-tailed Hummingbird). The latter two species were recorded
   frequently throughout the growing season (May-October), whereas C.
   latirostris was observed on one day in July, and H. leucotis on two days
   in April and May. Three of the four species were observed foraging from
   Castilleja tolucensis, an alpine Mexican endemic herb, at 4428 m above
   sea level, and all four species foraged from Penstemon gentianoides at
   the lower alpine sites 390(M 100. At the highest elevations, we observed
   hummingbirds hovering and perching on rocks while feeding from flowers
   at ground level. Both male and female of L. clemenciae and S.
   platycercus were present at patches of P. gentianoides; however, with S.
   platycercus, males accounted for more than 80\% of the individuals
   observed and more than 95\% of individuals observed at the highest
   elevations. Additionally, a survey of historical records from museum
   collections and bird sightings from e-databases revealed only three
   early records of hummingbirds in alpine sites, with only one observed
   earlier than 1987. This suggests that hummingbirds were not recorded
   earlier in alpine habitats because of a lack of sampling. Nevertheless,
   evidence from glacial retreats and plant distributions along an
   elevational gradient also indicate that hummingbirds have expanded their
   elevational range as new habitats have opened up for colonization
   associated with global climate change. The results reported here are the
   first records of the our hummingbird species in the Mexican alpine
   grassland and one of the highest altitudinal records for hummingbirds in
   North America. We discuss the importance and conservation implications
   of alpine ecosystems in Mexico as habitats for hummingbirds.}},

Title = {{Detecting capture-related mortality in radio-marked birds following
   release}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental assumption of avian survival analysis is that the act of
   capture, handling, and marking birds does not affect subsequent
   survival. This assumption is violated when animals experience injury,
   physiological stress, or disorientation during capture and handling that
   increases their mortality risk following release. Such capture-related
   effects must be accounted for during analysis, typically by censoring
   individuals from the survival history, to avoid biasing the resulting
   survival estimates. We reviewed studies of radio-marked upland game
   birds to characterize researcher approaches for addressing short-term
   effects of capture on survival, and used data from a study of Ruffed
   Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) to illustrate an empirical approach for
   evaluating such effects and identifying time thresholds to censor
   individuals that die shortly following release. A majority of studies
   (65\%) reported using some form of censoring for mortality that occurred
   within one to three weeks after release, although only 8\% of studies
   reported an empirical approach to identify a threshold for censorship.
   We found that Ruffed Grouse mortality was greater from one to six days
   following release when compared with 7 to 30 days. This threshold, and
   the proportion of birds censored as a result of it, is consistent with a
   number of previous studies of radio-marked Ruffed Grouse. We also found
   that short-term mortality of Ruffed Grouse following release was reduced
   by checking traps twice each day and by adequately concealing traps. We
   recommend that future studies of radio-marked birds employ empirical
   methods for detecting postrelease mortality thresholds, which will allow
   for reduced bias while minimizing unnecessary censorship of birds that
   die for reasons unrelated to capture.}},

Title = {{Reproductive success of Common Ravens influences nest predation rates of
   their prey: implications for egg-oiling techniques}},

Abstract = {{Abundance and distribution of Common Ravens (Corvus corax) have
   increased across western North America in recent decades, leading to
   conservation concern for sensitive prey species. Multiple management
   options have been proposed to reduce raven numbers or reduce the impacts
   of predation by ravens on sensitive species. We carried out a
   longitudinal study to evaluate the effects of experimentally
   manipulating the reproductive success of territorial ravens on the
   reproductive performance of their prey on Alcatraz Island across 6
   years. Specifically, we employed remote video-monitoring on nests of
   predator and prey to document the effects of oiling raven eggs, a
   technique to prevent eggs from hatching, on raven reproduction, and to
   estimate impacts of raven hatching success on their predation of
   Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) nests. We used
   Bayesian multinomial logistic exposure models to estimate night-heron
   nest and chick survival and account for variation in nest failure across
   different life stages (i.e., egg versus nestling). We found daily
   predation rates on night-heron nests (median: 1.71\%, 85\% CI:
   1.15-2.44\%) and chicks (median: 0.57\%, 85\% CI: 0.27-1.03\%) were the
   highest during years when ravens nested successfully. During years that
   raven eggs were oiled, daily predation rates on night-heron nests
   (0.98\%, 85\% CI: 0.55-1.57\%) and chicks (0.00\%, 85\% CI: 0.0-0.00\%)
   decreased, and we observed the lowest daily predation rates for nests
   (0.40\%, 85\% CI: 0.17-0.76\%) during years when raven nesting was
   naturally absent on the island. The greatest probability of survival of
   night-heron eggs and chicks occurred during years when ravens were
   present but not nesting on Alcatraz. Our results suggest that
   manipulation of raven breeding success can influence predation and
   reproductive performance of their prey. These results also indicate that
   egg-oiling can be a viable localized method to reduce raven recruitment
   and possibly aid in the conservation of sensitive avian species.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-automated image analysis techniques can save time and resources
   for detecting and counting birds in aerial imagery. Sophisticated
   object-based image analysis (OBIA) software is now widely available and
   has proven effective for various challenging detection tasks, but there
   is a need to develop accessible and readily adaptable procedures that
   can be implemented in an operational context. We developed a systematic,
   repeatable approach using commercial off-the-shelf OBIA software, and
   tested its effectiveness and efficiency to detect and count Lesser Snow
   Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in large numbers of images of
   breeding colonies across the Canadian Arctic that present a variety of
   landscapes, numerous confounding features, and varying illumination
   conditions and exposure levels. Coarse-scale review of analysis results
   was necessary to remove conspicuous clusters of commission errors, thus
   rendering the technique semiautomated. It was effective for imagery with
   spatial resolutions of 4-5 cm, producing overall accurate estimates of
   goose numbers compared to manual counts (R2 = 0.998, regression
   coefficient = 0.974) in 41 test images drawn from several breeding
   colonies. The total automated count (19,920) across all test images
   exceeded the manual count (19,836) by just 0.4\%. We estimate the
   typical time required to review images for errors to be only 5-10\% of
   that required to count birds manually. This could reduce the person-time
   required to analyze aerial photos of the major Arctic colonies of Snow
   Geese from several months to several days. Our approach could be adapted
   to many other bird detection tasks in aerial imagery by anyone
   possessing at least basic skills in image analysis and geographic
   information systems.}},

Abstract = {{Automated sound recording devices have become an important monitoring
   tool used to estimate species richness and abundance of birds in a
   variety of ecological and conservation studies. The prevalence of calls
   detected in a specific time period can be used as an index of relative
   abundance, to compare between populations. However, the statistical
   power to infer true differences in abundance between populations is low
   when detections are highly aggregated in time leading to high variance
   between samples from the same population. Here, we used two different
   sampling methods, and used the data from each to calculate species
   richness and acoustic prevalence of nine bird taxa from a total of 50
   sound recordings. The first method simulated typical monitoring
   techniques used by observers in the field by using a continuous
   five-minute section of the recording. The second method used the first
   10 seconds of each minute to create a composite recording, also of five
   minutes total duration. There was no difference in the mean prevalence
   index between methods. The intermittent samples, however, produced
   prevalence indices with a lower standard deviation (mean difference = 19
   \%), detected 26\% more species per five-minute sample and required 60\%
   less total listening time to detect as many species as the continuous
   method. The only cost of subsampling from a long recording is the extra
   digital memory and battery life required to obtain the recordings in the
   first place. Given that these costs are minor, the intermittent method
   holds much promise because it detects species more efficiently and
   provides greater power to detect differences in a species' relative
   abundance, which in turn should allow for better-informed management
   regarding population status and trends.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding migratory connectivity is fundamental to the ecology,
   evolution, and conservation of migratory species. The endangered
   Kirtland's Warbler (Setophagakirtlandii) has a restricted breeding range
   in early successional jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests with most of
   the population in northern Michigan and smaller subpopulations in
   Wisconsin and Ontario. Kirtland's Warblers spend the winter almost
   exclusively in the Bahamian Archipelago. Using a combination of visual
   searches and radiotelemetry, we relocated 89 Kirtland's Warblers on the
   breeding grounds that were captured and banded on two islands in the
   central Bahamas. We quantified the strength of migratory connectivity
   using a new metric ``MC,{''} and the Mantel test. We found that
   regardless of wintering island, Kirtland's Warblers intermixed heavily
   on the breeding grounds, having migrated to sites throughout the entire
   breeding range. Our estimates indicated weak connectivity between the
   wintering and breeding grounds, as might be predicted from a species
   that uses ephemeral, early successional habitat on both the wintering
   and breeding grounds. These results suggest that loss of habitat at a
   wintering site would have a diffuse effect across the entire population.
   The importance of a landscape approach to conservation of this species,
   long recognized in the breeding season and more recently emphasized on
   the wintering grounds, is supported by our findings.}},

Abstract = {{The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its
   partners invested substantial resources in creating and managing
   off-channel nesting habitat for Interior Least Terns (Sternula
   antillarum athalassos) and Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the
   central Platte River in Nebraska. Among other things, management
   activities implemented at nesting sites to increase nest and brood
   survival have included tree removal, construction of a water barrier
   surrounding the nesting areas, installation of predator fences, and
   predator trapping. We used 15 years of data at off-channel sites along
   the central Platte River to assess the influence of several biotic and
   abiotic variables on the survival of Interior Least Tern and Piping
   Plover nests and broods. We observed high survival rates for Interior
   Least Tern and Piping Plover nests and broods as two-thirds of Interior
   Least Tern and three-quarters of Piping Plover nests were successful and
   three-quarters of all Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover broods were
   successful. We found productivity of Interior Least Terns and Piping
   Plovers was reduced during both the nesting and brood-rearing stages by
   weather-related variables rather than variables the PRRIP can manage. As
   such, we conclude habitat management activities implemented at
   off-channel sites to date are sufficient for maintaining high levels of
   productivity for Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers along the
   central Platte River.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland ecosystems and the species that rely on them are one of the
   most urgent habitat conservation concerns in North America. Fundamental
   to any landscape conservation efforts is the identification of priority
   habitats to help target management efforts. Many avian species
   associated with prairie ecosystems have experienced population declines
   along with continued loss of prairie habitats. Additionally, given the
   long history of research in avian systems and the close grassland
   associations of some species, birds are excellent candidate taxa for the
   identification of priority habitats and can provide an informed starting
   point for multispecies assessments. We used data from the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey (1997-2014) to develop species distribution models
   for 15 grassland bird species across the Prairie Pothole Region of
   Canada. Model performance varied widely across species. Ten species
   demonstrated good model performance (average Boyce Index > 0.64 across
   5-fold cross validation). We used these 10 species to assess the
   influence of habitat covariates on the relative probability of
   occurrence, to compare the spatial scales of selection, and to generate
   multispecies habitat priority maps. Of the nine habitat covariates
   considered, most species predictably demonstrated positive associations
   with grassland habitats and avoidance of areas of high tree and shrub
   cover. Two covariates representing wetland abundance were also
   frequently included in the top models. The area covered by wetlands
   (w.area) was present in the top model for 5 of 10 species with a
   consistently estimated negative coefficient. However, a covariate, which
   represented the number of wetland basins (w.basins), was present in the
   top model for 8 of 10 species with an estimated positive coefficient for
   all but 1 species, representing a preference for more heterogeneous
   wetland landscapes. The larger spatial scales we considered tended to
   have greater explanatory power than smaller spatial scales and were thus
   more prevalent in the top models. The multispecies priority habitat maps
   that we produced can be used for future assessments of potential habitat
   management actions. Our work provides a critical foundation for the
   incorporation of grassland bird conservation goals into on-going
   landscape-planning initiatives in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of predicted declines and potential loss of individual
   populations on species-level genetic diversity is unclear. A number of
   taxa, including the Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), share
   wide-ranging geographic distributions in North American boreal forests
   with trailing-edge populations extending into the southern Appalachian
   Mountains. Trailing-edge populations in the southern portion of a
   species' ranges often harbor high levels of genetic diversity and unique
   genetic variants, and may be at risk of extinction from climate change.
   Climate change and other anthropogenic factors are causing declines in
   the Canada Warbler's southern trailing-edge populations, and with no
   genetic studies to date, the effect on species-level genetic diversity
   is uncertain. Species-specific microsatellite markers for the Canada
   Warbler were developed and validated using samples from three
   populations, including a southern trailing-edge population, to
   investigate their utility for intraspecific population studies. Eight of
   the microsatellite markers were informative for assessing genetic
   diversity and preliminary analysis suggests that they have potential for
   characterizing intraspecific neutral genetic diversity and structure
   among Canada Warbler populations.}},

Abstract = {{The documentation of anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) in nontarget
   species has centered around wildlife that inhabit urban or agricultural
   settings. However, recent studies in California have shown that AR use
   in remote forest settings has escalated and has exposed and killed
   forest carnivores. Anticoagulant rodenticides have been documented as
   physiological stressors for avian species. Northern Spotted Owl (Strix
   occidentalis caurina) critical and occupied habitat overlaps the areas
   where these studies occurred, yet no data were previously available to
   demonstrate whether this species was similarly affected. We investigated
   whether avian predators are also exposed to these specific pesticides
   and whether Barred Owls (Strix varia) may be a surrogate to indicate
   exposure rates in Northern Spotted Owls. We documented that 70\% of
   Northern Spotted Owls and 40\% of Barred Owls were exposed to one or
   more anticoagulant rodenticides. None of the rodent prey species sampled
   within the study area were positive for ARs. There were no spatial
   clusters for either low or high rates of exposure, though we detected
   low temporal trend early on throughout the study area. We hypothesize a
   recent change in land-use toward marijuana cultivation may have led to
   the increased use of AR in this area. This study demonstrates
   environmental contamination within occupied Northern Spotted Owl habitat
   and that Barred Owls can be used as adequate surrogates for detecting
   these pollutants in a rare species such as the Northern Spotted Owl.
   Furthermore, additional studies should focus on whether these pesticides
   are also affecting prey availability for these forest avian species.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of anthropogenic activities on breeding bird populations are
   typically assessed using nest success despite the importance of the
   postfledging period and juvenile survival for the population dynamics of
   many birds. Using a combination of radio telemetry data collected
   between 2012 and 2014, and long-term monitoring data collected between
   2005 and 2016, we evaluated whether postfledging survival of Yellow
   Warblers (Setophagapetechia) is affected when their riparian nesting
   habitat becomes inundated by the Upper Arrow Lakes Reservoir in the
   Columbia River Valley near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada.
   Thirty-eight percent of radio-tagged fledglings (n = 26) survived for at
   least 21 days after leaving the nest. Radio-tagged birds that fledged
   from nests in territories that were inundated by water tended to be have
   lower survival than those that fledged from nests in territories that
   were not inundated by water. Local recruitment was low (6.4\%, n = 438).
   Local recruitment was nevertheless positively affected by nestling
   condition prior to fledging. Fledglings from territories that were not
   inundated by water also tended to be more likely to recruit locally than
   those that fledged from territories that were inundated by water. In
   both cases, we estimated that reservoir operations that flooded habitat
   reduced postfledging survival or local recruitment by approximately
   50\%. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the
   postfledging period when developing mitigation measures or management
   plans aimed at minimizing the impact of anthropogenic activities on bird
   populations.}},

Title = {{How do farmland bird communities in rural settlements respond to human
   relocations associated with land subsidence induced by coal mining in
   China?}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale underground coal mining has created large-area land
   subsidence in the North China Plain, resulting in drastic habitat
   changes for farmland birds. Among others, relocation of local residents
   due to land subsidence may lead to a reduction in human disturbance, and
   accompanying vegetation recovery in rural settlements. However, it
   remains largely unknown how farmland birds respond to these
   environmental changes. During the summer of 2016 and winter of
   2016-2017, we used the line transect method to quantify farmland bird
   communities in both inhabited and recently abandoned villages in the
   Huaibei coal mining area in the North China Plain. We hypothesized that
   bird communities would change in terms of abundance, species diversity,
   and composition as a response to human relocations. We also explored
   relative effects of reductions in human disturbance, and accompanying
   changes in vegetation. Both cover and vertical diversity of vegetation
   increased following relocations of local residents in abandoned
   villages. Bird abundance, species richness, and diversity were higher in
   these villages in both summer and winter. Bird species composition also
   differed between the two village types in both summer and winter.
   Compositional differences in bird communities were related to both human
   disturbance and vegetation structure, but more to the latter. Farmland
   birds positively responded to lower human disturbance, even though they
   are well-adapted to the disturbed agricultural environment. However,
   these temporarily positive effects may disappear in the near future,
   given the upcoming transition from terrestrial ecosystem into subsidence
   ponds because of continuing underground coal mining. We should further
   monitor changes in bird communities, and effects of coal mining at a
   regional scale, rather than being too optimistic on temporarily positive
   effects of local disturbance reduction. We provide a small-scale but
   important case study that may prompt urgent attention to farmland bird
   communities in large-scale agricultural landscapes in China.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation planning and decision making for species of concern
   requires precise information on abundance and habitat associations. We
   conducted transect surveys throughout the Northern Tuli Game Reserve,
   Botswana during June-July 2014 and May-July 2015 to estimate the
   occupancy and abundance of Kori Bustards (Ardeotis kori). The
   probability of occupancy of Kori Bustards was greater in areas with tree
   canopy cover <= 50\% (psi 2014 = 0.37, SE +/- 0.09; psi 2015 = 0.39, SE
   +/- 0.06) when compared with areas with tree canopy cover > 50\% (psi
   2014 = 0.00, SE +/- 0.00; psi 2015 = 0.00, SE +/- 0.00). Densities of
   Kori Bustards ranged from 0.03-5.02 individuals/km(2) at our study
   sites. They showed annual variation, and densities were highest in areas
   where vegetation was classified as sparse or bare soil. Areas at low (<=
   540 m above sea level) and high (>= 540 m above sea level) elevations at
   our study sites also exhibited differences in density of Kori Bustards
   but elevational differences varied among years. Areas categorized as
   both sparse vegetation and higher elevation had the highest estimated
   densities in 2014 with 5.02 individuals/km(2). Areas categorized as
   sparse vegetation and lower elevation had the highest densities in 2015
   with 2.20 individuals/km(2). Our study demonstrates that areas of sparse
   vegetation and open canopy areas are important to Kori Bustards.
   However, open canopy areas outside of reserves may be at risk of
   conversion to row crop and other forms of agriculture as human
   populations and demands for food increase. Habitat-specific information
   will be useful for future studies to identify risks during landscape
   conservation planning within the range of the Kori Bustard.}},

Abstract = {{The Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is an imperiled
   songbird that breeds in early-successional plant communities of eastern
   North America. Conservation efforts on the breeding grounds have become
   a priority because population declines are thought to be driven, in
   part, by the loss of breeding habitat. Although the species is known to
   use a variety of upland and wetland cover types, the majority of
   previous research on the species has been conducted in uplands. Although
   patterns of Goldenwinged Warbler habitat use within anthropogenic upland
   communities are well understood, such information within naturally
   occurring habitats are scant. We compared Golden-winged Warbler
   densities in natural shrub-wetlands and nearby upland timber harvest
   that conformed to species-specific habitat guidelines of the Poconos
   Region of Pennsylvania. We also identified vegetation characteristics of
   natural shrub-wetlands associated with high warbler abundance. Our
   analyses suggest that timber harvests and natural shrub-wetlands of the
   Poconos supported similar densities of Golden-winged Warblers. N-mixture
   models suggested that natural shrub-wetlands with low canopy cover and
   high densities of 1-2 m tall woody stems hosted more Golden-winged
   Warblers. Wetland complexes comprising more edge and those with more
   emergent wetland types supported the highest warbler abundances. This
   suggests that the species requires edges when it occurs within
   shrub-wetlands, a pattern not observed within our timber harvests, which
   were designed to have adequate tree cover throughout. Findings from our
   study combined with those from concurrent research evaluating
   Goldenwinged Warbler reproductive success suggests that timber harvests
   following Golden-winged Warbler habitat guidelines have similar capacity
   as natural shrub-wetlands to support breeding populations. A future
   effort to quantify the potential of different wetland types to host
   breeding Golden-winged Warblers is warranted. Such information used in
   combination with timber harvest planning will provide insight for
   landscape-level conservation that considers maintaining appropriate
   amounts of nesting habitat to sustain Golden-winged Warblers in this
   region.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The boreal and hemiboreal forests are facing increasing anthropogenic
   development in areas that have traditionally been remote and
   inaccessible. Although these forests are recognized as important to
   breeding waterfowl, breeding season vital rates and the influence of
   anthropogenic development on these rates remain largely unexplored. I
   estimated nest and brood survival of Ring-necked Ducks (Aythya collaris)
   in the hemiboreal forest of Minnesota. I located 115 nests on 43
   wetlands, radio-tagged 65 nesting hens, and monitored 32 broods. I
   considered the influence of distance to and density of buildings and
   roads, and road-surface type, as well as wetland characteristics and
   other variables hypothesized to influence waterfowl vital rates. The
   best-supported nest survival models included covariates for distance
   from the nest to nearest road and road-surface type. Nest survival
   declined with increasing distance from roads and was higher for nests
   near paved roads, at least when the distance was < 400 m. However, an
   interaction term in the top-ranked model suggested the effect of road
   type varied as a function of distance from nest. The model-averaged
   estimate of 35-day nest survival, based on the top two models was 0.278
   (SE = 0.048). Brood survival increased with brood age and open water
   area, and decreased with nesting habitat area and distance from open
   water to nearest road. Cumulative brood survival to 30 days was 0.263
   (SE = 0.035). These findings indicate that roads may influence both nest
   and brood survival. Furthermore, higher brood survival at wetlands with
   less nesting habitat area and more open water area may explain why hens
   move broods. Conservation managers should consider how habitat needs
   change throughout the breeding season to adequately address the needs of
   Ring-necked Ducks. Further study is needed to understand how
   anthropogenic development can be incorporated into conservation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{The Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) is typically described
   as a mature forest species requiring moderate to steep slopes and dense
   understory vegetation for breeding. However, nesting microhabitat
   characteristics vary regionally. Given the extensive variation in
   landscape topography, forest composition, and habitat structure across
   the breeding range, identification of important local landscape features
   and microhabitat characteristics is needed to formulate and implement
   improved conservation actions for the species. We characterized
   important habitat associations at two distinct scales (the landscape
   scale and the nest scale) to provide a detailed description of
   Worm-eating Warbler breeding habitat requirements in southern Indiana.
   Results from our point count and nest searching surveys emphasize the
   importance of terrain variables (i.e., steep SW-facing slopes) within
   mature forest habitat in southern Indiana. In addition, the structural
   microhabitat variable, leaf-litter depth, was an important predictor at
   the nest scale. Our dual-scale characterization of important habitat
   associations during the nesting portion of the breeding season provides
   a more complete understanding of Worm-eating Warbler breeding ecology in
   this portion of its range.}},

Title = {{Using conspecific broadcast for Willow Flycatcher restoration}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) populations have been in decline
   across the western United States for decades. California populations are
   especially vulnerable with fewer than 500 pairs remaining in the state.
   Declines and local extirpations continue despite extensive habitat
   restoration and improved management designed to help conserve Willow
   Flycatchers. Such efforts may have failed to help reverse these trends
   in part because Willow Flycatchers rarely recolonize habitat after
   extirpation, regardless of present habitat suitability. Failure to
   recolonize habitat may be because prospecting Willow Flycatchers, like
   many other songbird species, assess habitat suitability based on the
   presence of conspecifics, making them unlikely to consider unoccupied
   habitat as potential breeding grounds. If true, broadcasting conspecific
   vocalizations in suitable but unoccupied habitat could help facilitate
   recolonization. During the 2016 and 2017 breeding seasons, we assessed
   the effectiveness of providing artificial social cues as a means of
   restoring Willow Flycatchers to suitable but unoccupied restored meadows
   in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. We selected 14
   experimental meadows where conspecific songs were broadcast during the
   settlement and breeding periods and 19 control meadows where no
   broadcasts took place. All the meadows were recently restored, contain
   high-quality habitat with hydrological characteristics and vegetation
   similar to meadows where Sierra Willow Flycatchers successfully breed,
   and were confirmed to be unoccupied in the year prior to their inclusion
   in the study. We observed Willow Flycatchers at five of 14 experimental
   meadows (35.75\%) during the breeding season and at one of 19 control
   meadows (5.3\%). We found that habitat characteristics also play a role
   in the efficacy of this technique, as Willow Flycatcher presence was
   highly significantly related to the combination of both the experimental
   treatment and meadow size. These results demonstrate that within large,
   restored meadows, conspecific broadcasts may be an effective strategy
   for restoring Willow Flycatchers.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the patterns of co-occurrence between diurnal
   birds such as woodpeckers and nocturnal birds such as owls, which they
   may facilitate. Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern
   Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) are nocturnal, secondary
   cavity-nesting birds that inhabit forests. For nesting and roosting,
   both species require natural cavities or, more commonly, those that
   woodpeckers create. Using day and nighttime broadcast surveys (n = 150
   locations) in the Rocky Mountain biogeographic region of Idaho, USA, we
   surveyed for owls and woodpeckers to assess patterns of co-occurrence
   and evaluated the hypothesis that forest owls and woodpeckers
   co-occurred more frequently than expected by chance because of the
   facilitative nature of their biological interaction. We also examined
   co-occurrence patterns between owl species to understand their possible
   competitive interactions. Finally, to assess whether co-occurrence
   patterns arose because of species interactions or selection of similar
   habitat types, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to
   examine habitat associations within this cavity-nesting bird community.
   We found that Flammulated Owls co-occurred more with Hairy Woodpeckers
   (Picoides villosus), Northern Saw-whet Owls co-occurred with Northern
   Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus
   nuchalis) and, when primary excavators were considered as agroup, each
   species of owl was positively associated with the presence of
   woodpeckers. The owl species were distributed independently of one
   another suggesting a lack of competitive interactions. The CCA had
   relatively low explanatory power but suggested that habitat associations
   alone did not explain the patterns of positive co-occurrence we
   observed: Flammulated Owls and Hairy Woodpeckers associated with
   different habitats and Northern Saw-whet Owls, Northern Flickers, and
   Red-naped Sapsuckers appeared as habitat generalists. We interpret these
   patterns of co-occurrence and habitat use as evidence that woodpeckers
   facilitate presence of these species of owl and suggest management for
   forest owls could also include focus on the diurnal species with which
   they appear to associate.}},

Abstract = {{The near-threatened Japanese Paradise-Flycatcher (Terpsiphone
   atrocaudata) consists of three subspecies, one of which, T. a.
   periophthalmica, has an important population on Lanyu, Taiwan. After
   briefly reviewing the species' conservation status in its breeding
   range, we describe our field work in Lanyu during the breeding seasons
   of 2009 and 2010. We first established that the territory size of a male
   flycatcher is around 1.16 hectares. We then visited 224 1-hectare grid
   cells randomly distributed across Lanyu and established 120 presence
   grid cells. We then used these presence grid cells and nine
   environmental data layers to build an ensemble distribution model using
   the software Maxent. The model showed that the Japanese
   Paradise-Flycatcher prefers relatively wet forest habitats at elevations
   of 50-300 m. Using the model, we estimated that the extent of suitable
   habitat covered approximately 12.0 km(2) (or 26\%) of Lanyu's surface
   area, which could hold approximately 1000 male territories. Forest cover
   increased between 1948 and 2006 by approximately 7.6 km(2) (or 16\%) of
   Lanyu's surface area, which, all other things being equal, should have
   resulted in a population increase of around 30\%. Given the absence of
   current threats, the Lanyu population is assumed to be relatively
   stable. Given this new information and our review of the species'
   conservation status, we suggest that the species may be down-listed to
   ``least concern.{''} However, if the distinct subspecies T. a.
   periophthalmica would be elevated to species status or be considered two
   independent conservation units (one in Lanyu and one in Batanes,
   Philippines), its conservation status would be much more precarious
   given it only occurs in five known localities (Lanyu and four islands in
   Batanes) of limited geographic range, and a population size of
   approximately 1000 males in Lanyu and an unknown population size in
   Batanes. Therefore, we conclude that more information is needed about
   (1) the species' status in Batanes, (2) its migration and wintering
   grounds, and (3) the taxonomic status of the three subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated
   species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically
   within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage
   logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a
   negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One
   strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on
   Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense
   snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely
   untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag
   islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species.
   In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were
   effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following
   logging operations that covered 45\% of the burned area. We
   systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and
   compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to
   other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined
   significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed
   Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral
   unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat
   for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this
   study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the
   first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year,
   which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers postlogging.}},

Abstract = {{Red Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra percna; e.g., Type 8) is considered a
   distinctive taxonomic group likely restricted to the island of
   Newfoundland. Although it has been speculated that the percna subspecies
   may be extinct, recent works continue to show that Red Crossbills from
   insular Newfoundland are morphologically and vocally distinct.
   Large-billed Red Crossbills that may be percna have been observed
   outside Newfoundland and these sightings are likely due to movements of
   birds to the mainland during times of food shortages in their core range
   of occurrence. Red Crossbills had been previously detected on Anticosti
   Island, in 1963 and in the 1980s, but subspecies or vocal type
   identification was not attempted at that time. In recent years, regular
   sightings of large-billed Red Crossbills have been reported annually on
   Anticosti Island. Our main objectives with this study were to find Red
   Crossbills on Anticosti Island to (1) confirm the presence of percna by
   collecting vocal and morphological data, and (2) determine habitat
   associations of observed Red Crossbills. Morphometric and spectrographic
   analyses confirmed that some of the Red Crossbills present on Anticosti
   during our study were percna. Our results also suggest that the island
   may support breeding individuals of percna, which has direct
   consequences for the species' recovery capability, because it would
   increase the known population of this threatened species.}},

Title = {{Temporal changes in avian abundance in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood
   forests of central Saskatchewan, Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The boreal forest provides important breeding habitat for many migratory
   songbirds; however, changes in disturbance regimes have led to concern
   for populations breeding there. Monitoring data to track changes in
   boreal forest bird populations are scarce. Therefore, we repeated
   surveys at historic research sites in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood
   forest in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to test for changes in abundance
   in different forest age classes. We used GIS analyses and habitat data
   to test whether observed changes in abundance were correlated with
   within-stand changes in habitat over approximately 20 years. Eight of
   the ten species examined showed evidence for change in abundance. Trends
   from our study showed little correlation with regional trends from the
   North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and generally displayed
   greater magnitude and precision. Species associated with closedcanopy
   forests declined more rapidly than suggested by BBS surveys, whereas
   species associated with disturbance generally had opposite trends to the
   BBS. Decreased abundance of species such as Swainson's Thrush (Catharus
   ustulatus) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata) correlated
   with loss of forest cover from fire or harvesting. Conversely, changes
   in the abundance of species associated with early successional forest
   and canopy gaps were primarily correlated with within-stand disturbances
   (e.g., Magnolia Warbler {[}Setophaga magnolia]) and changes in the
   proportion of the stands composed of conifers (e.g., White-throated
   Sparrow {[}.Zonotrichia albicollis]). We suggest repeating historic
   surveys and comparing trends with other monitoring programs to provide a
   weight-of-evidence approach to assess overall support for changes in
   species' status for regions where data are sparse. Our results are
   consistent with previous studies that predict that changes in the forest
   age-class distribution could alter boreal forest bird abundance and
   community composition. Long-term conservation plans should integrate
   projected land-use and climate effects on boreal forest bird
   populations.}},

Title = {{The effect of industrial noise on owl occupancy in the boreal forest at
   multiple spatial scales}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Noise in natural environments can mask important acoustic signals used
   for animal communication. Owls use vocal communication to attract mates
   and defend territories, and also rely on acoustic cues to locate their
   prey. Industrial noise has been shown to negatively affect owl hunting
   success and reduce foraging efficiency by affecting their ability to
   detect prey, but it is not known if this results in reduced habitat
   suitability for owls in areas near industrial noise sources. To
   determine if owls avoid areas surrounding industrial noise sources in
   northeastern Alberta and at what scale, we acoustically surveyed for
   owls at sites with chronic industrial noise, sites with intermittent
   traffic noise, and sites with no noise. We deployed autonomous recording
   units at multiple stations within each site to detect territorial
   individuals vocalizing. Detections of owls were extracted from the
   recordings using automated species recognition and analyzed using
   occupancy models at two spatial scales. Barred Owls (Strix varia), Great
   Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), and Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) were
   equally likely to occupy both types of noisy sites compared to sites
   with no noise, indicating that site level occupancy (representing a home
   range scale) was unaffected by the presence of noise sources on the
   landscape. On a smaller scale, there was no decline in station level
   occupancy (representing use of the area surrounding recording stations)
   at stations with higher noise levels for either of the three owl
   species. Our study contributes to research on the effects of
   anthropogenic noise, but suggests the effect on owls is minimal, and
   unlikely to result in a population change.}},

Title = {{Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) survival, recovery, and harvest rates

Abstract = {{Northern Pintail (Anas acuta; hereafter pintail) experienced a
   significant population decline in North America in the 1980s but did not
   rebound to the previous population level the way that other prairie
   dabbling duck species (Anas spp.) did once habitat conditions improved.
   Although the population decline occurred throughout the breeding range
   of pintails, the decline was most pronounced and sustained in Prairie
   Canada, i.e., southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Thus, we estimated and
   examined annual survival, recovery, and harvest rates of pintails banded
   in Prairie Canada from 1960-2014. Annual survival rates varied by sex
   but were relatively high compared to those of other dabbling duck
   species and increased slightly over the study period to end at 0.64 +/-
   0.13 (SE) and 0.74 +/- 0.10 for females and males, respectively.
   Recovery and harvest rates varied over time but generally declined in
   the 1980s and increased from the early 1990s until the end of the study
   period. There was no clear evidence that hunting bag limit restrictions
   affected annual survival, recovery, or harvest rates. In addition, we
   could find no compelling evidence that harvest mortality was
   substantially additive to nonharvest mortality for pintails. However, we
   could not definitively ascertain the effects of the restrictions, and we
   suggest that a trial basis of liberalized hunting bag limits would do
   much to improve the understanding of harvest and population dynamics of
   pintails and pose little risk to the population. Based on our results,
   we believe that measures other than harvest restrictions will likely
   have to be taken to elevate the pintail population to the North American
   Waterfowl Management Plan objective.}},

Title = {{Variability in egg size and population declines of Herring Gulls in
   relation to fisheries and climate conditions}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Changes in clutch and egg size in many avian species have been linked to
   seasonal variation, female physiological state, and laying date during
   breeding season. These reproductive variables have also been linked to
   population status and habitat variables. Recent declines in Herring Gull
   (Larus argentatus) populations in the Atlantic region may be associated
   with environmental changes, fishery activities, or natural species
   interactions and fluctuations. We studied variability and trends in
   Herring Gull egg, clutch, and population size at a cluster of three
   islands of the Grand Manan Archipelago in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. A
   generalized linear model investigating variability in Herring Gull egg
   volume over a 28-year period (1988 to 2015) showed increasing egg volume
   since a low in 2000, significant positive correlations with regional
   fisheries landings, and weak interactions with sea surface temperature
   and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Herring Gull egg
   size decreased by 11.6\% from 1988 to 2000, but both egg size and clutch
   size have increased significantly since 2001. A 2015/2016 population
   estimate of the three islands showed a 36\% decline in Herring Gull
   numbers since 2001. Changes in annual and seasonal availability of
   various fishery related food sources, specifically decreasing Atlantic
   herring (Clupea harengus) and groundfish landings and increasing
   American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings, may be linked to these
   increases in reproductive variables. However, it appears that other
   factors may be influencing the declining gull population because despite
   increased availability of alternative food sources and increased clutch
   size and egg volume, there has been no documented increase in abundance.
   Interspecific interactions, anthropogenic activities, and climatic
   variability may also have a role in these population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The progressive exploitation and destruction of nesting habitat in
   recent years, combined with the substantial pressure from legal and
   illegal removal of wild nestlings and adults, justifies the development
   of a comprehensive study on the reproductive biology of the
   Turquoise-fronted Parrot (Amazona aestiva). We analyzed breeding
   parameters in a wild protected population of Turquoise-fronted Parrots
   in the Chaco forest, Argentina, examining variation among years, over
   the course of the breeding season, and in relation to the age of the
   nest. Mean clutch-size per nesting attempt was 3.68 eggs. Hatching
   success (proportion of eggs laid that hatch) was 0.73. Fledging success
   (proportion of nestlings that fledge) was 0.88. The overall breeding
   success (mean number of fledglings per laying female per year) was 0.95.
   Clutch size did not vary among years but it decreased with the delay of
   the nest initiation date. Hatching failure was the greatest cause of egg
   partial losses, and brood reduction was the main cause of nestling
   partial loses. Brood reduction was positively correlated with clutch
   size and with egg-laying date. We did not find interannual variation in
   any of the clutch or brood size variables. Our results showed that the
   population of Turquoise-fronted Parrots in the dry Chaco forest has high
   values of clutch size and nestling survival, and low values of hatching
   success. However, some aspects of the breeding biology need more
   attention, especially if the species continues to be harvested.}},

Abstract = {{Urban greenspaces are important areas for biodiversity, serving multiple
   uses, sometimes including conservation and biodiversity management.
   Citizen science provides a cheap and potentially effective method of
   assisting biodiversity management in urban greenspaces. Despite this
   potential, the minimum amount of citizen science data required to
   adequately represent a community is largely untested. We used eBird data
   to test the minimum sampling effort required to be confident in results
   for three biological metrics, species richness, Shannon diversity, and
   community composition (Bray-Curtis similarity). For our data, from 30
   urban greenspaces in North America, for a 90\% threshold level, a
   minimum mean number of 210, 33, and 58 checklists were necessary for
   species richness, Shannon diversity, and community composition,
   respectively. However, when we eliminated those species that were
   present in fewer than 5\% of checklists at a given site, there was a
   marked decrease in mean minimum number of checklists required (17, 9,
   and 52, respectively). Depending on the ecological questions of
   interest, eBird data may be a potentially reliable data source in urban
   greenspaces. We provide a validation methodology using eBird data, with
   its associated code in the R statistical environment, to provide
   confidence for land managers and community groups managing urban
   greenspaces.}},

Abstract = {{We used two data-recording, open-array marine surveillance radars to
   track microscale movements of nocturnal migrants at a wind energy
   project in northeast British Columbia during the preoperational
   (2008-2010) and operational periods (2011-2012). Data was collected
   during the peak periods of spring and fall passerine migration in each
   year. We measured bearing and altitude of nocturnal migrants, as well as
   the average number of migrants flying in the airspace closest to the
   wind turbines. Using weather data on wind direction and strength during
   the periods of monitored migration, we calculated flow-assistance of
   wind in aiding migration. Although there was greater flow-assistance to
   movement in spring over fall migration, we did not find a significant
   difference between the preoperational and operational periods in
   flow-assisted flight. The altitude at which migrants flew did differ
   with development phase of the wind facility; migrants flew at higher
   altitudes during years when the turbines were operational compared to
   preoperational years. Although the proportion of migrants detected in
   the airspace 0-150 m above ground level (ag1), coinciding with turbine
   height, did not differ with season or operational phase of the
   installation, there was a reduction in the proportion of migrants in the
   airspace just above turbines (151-300 m ag1) when turbines were
   operational. In general, though, the overall altitudes used by migrants
   were typically higher than turbine height, so the adjustments we
   documented would only further reduce what appear to be already low
   levels of collision risk at this particular facility. We discuss
   possible reasons why this facility appeared to induce low collision risk
   to migrants, and how this might inform siting decisions of other wind
   facilities.}},

Title = {{Species-environment associations and predicted distribution of Black

Abstract = {{We present a species distribution model (SDM) for prediction of Black
   Oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) breeding pair occurrence in Haida
   Gwaii, British Columbia. Boosted regression trees, a machine learning
   algorithm, was used to fit the model. In total, 14 predictors were
   selected a priori through development of a conceptual model. Breeding
   pair occurrence data were compiled from two available surveys conducted
   in 2005 and 2010 (545 km of shoreline surveyed in total). All data were
   aggregated to common model units (vector polyline shoreline segments
   approximately 100 m in length), which approximate breeding territory
   size. The final model, which included eight predictors (distance to
   treeline, island area, wave exposure, shoreline type, intertidal area
   within 50 m, segment length, rat occurrence, and intertidal area within
   1000 m), had excellent predictive ability assessed by 10- fold cross-
   validation (AUC = 0.89). Predictive ability was reduced when the model
   was trained and tested on spatially (AUC = 0.86) and temporally (AUC =
   0.83) independent data. Distance to treeline and island area had
   greatest influence on the model (RI = 41.5\% and RI = 36.7\%,
   respectively); we hypothesized that these predictors are related to
   avoidance of predators. Partial dependence plots revealed that breeding
   pairs tended to occur: further from the treeline, on small islands, at
   high wave exposures, at moderate intertidal area, on bedrock or gravel
   shoreline types, and on islands without rats. However, breeding pairs
   tended not to occur on very small islands and at very high wave
   exposures, which we hypothesize to reflect avoidance of nest washout.
   Results may inform local conservation and management efforts, i.e., from
   predictive maps, and eventual development of a high- resolution (similar
   to 100 m) model for prediction of Black Oystercatcher breeding pairs at
   a regional scale. Further, methods and GIS data sets developed may be
   used to model distribution of other coastal species in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Nest boxes are posted to provide breeding sites for cavity-nesting birds
   but less is known about their function in the nonbreeding season, when
   nest boxes may become important roost sites. In winter months, we
   surveyed 79 nest boxes before dawn for roosting American Kestrels (Falco
   sparverius) and other cavity-nesting birds in southwestern Idaho and we
   reviewed camera recordings from the entire nonbreeding season at a nest
   box within the study site to better understand nest box use in the
   nonbreeding season. During surveys we found seven American Kestrels
   roosting in six nest boxes, Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) in 16
   nest boxes and a European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) in one nest box.
   Video recordings revealed inter- and intra-specific conflicts within the
   nest box as well as a positive relationship between the length of night
   and the time spent roosting in the box. These results suggest that
   cavity-nesting birds in our study area are likely to seek out and
   compete for nest boxes to use as roost sites in the nonbreeding season
   and the effects of nest boxes on the nonbreeding season ecology of birds
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Nest boxes can be seen as a conservation tool for improving low-grade
   nesting habitat but it is unclear how sympatric species using boxes
   establish a spatial distribution relative to conspecifics and
   heterospecifics. This study determined the distances between nest boxes
   occupied by Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Great Tits (Parus major)
   in two British woodlands to ascertain whether spatial distribution was
   affected by species and, if it was, whether there were reproductive
   consequences of this breeding distribution. Occupancy of nest boxes at
   two woodland sites were recorded on an annual basis between 2010 and
   2014, inclusive. Distances between nest boxes, and reproductive
   activity, were recorded. Even if nest boxes showed a clumped
   distribution in the woodlands, the occupancy of the boxes was random.
   Not all boxes were used and the minimum distance between occupied boxes
   was at least twice the distance between boxes in general. Blue Tits
   tended to have greater distances between boxes containing conspecifics
   but distances between boxes containing heterospecifics were generally of
   comparable lengths. Reproductive output was only affected in relation to
   clutch size for Blue Tits nesting at one site. Nest boxes that aim to
   improve habitats that lack suitable nesting sites should be placed to
   reflect actual dispersal distances of the focal bird species.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Swallows, along with other aerial insectivores, are experiencing steep
   population declines. Decreased insect abundance has been implicated as a
   potential cause of the decline. However, to determine if there is a
   guild-level effect of reduced insect abundance on swallows, research is
   needed to examine relationships between insect abundance and breeding
   success for multiple species. The goal of our study was two-fold. First,
   we determined if insect abundance during nestling rearing varied with
   breeding phenology for three species of swallows, Barn (Hirundo
   rustica), Cliff (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), and Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor), such that swallows breeding when insects are
   abundant have greater success. Then we determined if insect abundance
   was related to nestling survival and mass (as a proxy for postfledgling
   survival). We collected insects daily at each of three study sites
   during the breeding season, monitored swallow nests to determine
   breeding phenology and success, and weighed nestlings at or just prior
   to the peak of rapid nestling growth to determine mass. We found early
   hatching Cliff and Tree Swallow nests had higher insect abundance during
   nestling rearing. However, neither nestling survival nor mass were
   related to insect abundance. Our results suggest that breeding success
   in three species of swallows was not related to insect abundance in our
   study area. We suggest that the role of insect abundance on aerial
   insectivore declines may vary across their geographic range, and call
   for broad-scale, multispecies research on aerial insectivore declines.}},

Abstract = {{Automated signal recognition software is increasingly used to extract
   species detection data from acoustic recordings collected using
   autonomous recording units (ARUs), but there is little practical
   guidance available for ecologists on the application of this technology.
   Performance evaluation is an important part of employing automated
   acoustic recognition technology because the resulting data quality can
   vary with a variety of factors. We reviewed the bioacoustic literature
   to summarize performance evaluation and found little consistency in
   evaluation, metrics employed, or terminology used. We also found that
   few studies examined how score threshold, i. e., cut-off for the level
   of confidence in target species classification, affected performance,
   but those that did showed a strong impact of score threshold on
   performance. We used the lessons learned from our literature review and
   best practices from the field of machine learning to evaluate the
   performance of five readily-available automated signal recognition
   programs. We used the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) as our model
   species because it has simple, consistent, and frequent vocalizations.
   We found that automated signal recognition was effective for determining
   Common Nighthawk presence-absence and call rate, particularly at low
   score thresholds, but that occupancy estimates from the data processed
   with recognizers were consistently lower than from data generated by
   human listening and became unstable at high score thresholds. Of the
   five programs evaluated, our convolutional neural network (CNN)
   recognizer performed best, with recognizers built in Song Scope and
   MonitoR also performing well. The RavenPro and Kaleidoscope recognizers
   were moderately effective, but produced more false positives than the
   other recognizers. Finally, we synthesized six general recommendations
   for ecologists who employ automated signal recognition software,
   including what to use as a test benchmark, how to incorporate score
   threshold, what metrics to use, and how to evaluate efficiency. Future
   studies should consider our recommendations to build a body of
   literature on the effectiveness of this technology for avian research
   and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Urban grassy rights-of-way (ROWs) such as along transmission lines could
   be managed cumulatively as collections of potential grassland habitats
   to contribute to the conservation of grassland birds. To optimize
   conservation opportunities, managing urban ROWs for grassland birds may
   require reductions in frequent mowing and spraying and may also depend
   on the suitability of landscape structure within the urban environment.
   We compared effects of mowing regime relative to effects of the matrix
   surrounding ROWs on grassland bird abundance and occupancy along 48 ROWs
   in and surrounding Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2007-2009. We used both
   hierarchical distance-sampling and multiseason occupancy modeling
   methods to account for effects of urbanization (e.g., traffic noise),
   observer experience, time of season, and survey time in the morning on
   the probability of detecting birds at study sites. We did not find
   differences in detection of grassland birds due to urbanization, but we
   did find effects of time of season, survey time in the morning, and
   observer experience. After accounting for availability, we found that
   several species declined along ROWs that were surrounded by more urban
   or wooded land. Western Meadowlark occupancy increased as the amount of
   grassland within 100 m of ROWs increased. Savannah Sparrow showed some
   evidence of increasing with mowing, whereas Clay-colored Sparrow showed
   some evidence of decreasing with mowing, although these species and
   Western Meadowlark also increased within hayed ROWs. We conclude that
   urban ROWs managed as grassland bird habitats will probably attract more
   individuals and species if there is less nearby urban or wooded land and
   more grassland, and within which there is a mixture of unmowed and hayed
   ROW sections.}},

Abstract = {{In the western North Atlantic, Common (Sterna hirundo) and Arctic (S.
   paradisaea) Terns are sympatric at breeding colonies but show divergent
   migration strategies to coastal areas of South America and pelagic
   regions of the Antarctic, respectively. During 2013, we studied
   postbreeding movements of adult Common (n = 130) and Arctic (n = 52)
   Terns from four breeding colonies in the eastern USA and Canada using
   digital very high frequency (VHF) transmitters and an array of 62
   automated radio telemetry towers. Relative to hatch dates at respective
   colonies, Arctic Terns departed breeding sites an average of eight days
   later than Common Terns. Common Terns were detected during the
   postbreeding period by coastal towers upward of 850 km south of their
   original nesting sites. The telemetry array detected postbreeding
   movements of Arctic Terns from the Petit Manan Island colony in the Gulf
   of Maine as they traveled eastward past Nova Scotia, Canada, mostly
   during the night. Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts, USA was identified as
   an important staging area for Common Terns from all colonies, whereby
   26\% of 53 tagged Common Terns from colonies in the Gulf of Maine and
   Canada were detected for up to three weeks. Common Terns typically
   arrived at Nantucket Sound within 2 h of sunset, 2 to 10 days after
   their last detection at Gulf of Maine and Canadian colonies, suggesting
   rapid postbreeding dispersal. Postbreeding dispersal of Arctic Terns was
   poorly documented with the telemetry array, suggesting that this species
   is not using coastal sites for staging, and is instead departing
   directly from colonies to offshore staging areas prior to long-distance
   migrations. We conclude that digital VHF telemetry is a useful method
   for monitoring regional movements of Common Terns, but additional
   offshore receiving stations are needed to effectively monitor movements
   of Arctic Terns away from their nesting colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Survival and mobility have important implications for population
   management for game species. These parameters are influenced by both
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We describe movements (commuting
   flights between diurnal refuges and nocturnal feeding places; and escape
   flights during cold spells) and winter survival rate of Eurasian
   Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) wintering in Spain. We also evaluate
   factors influencing these variables, using 51 radio-tracked birds over
   three winters (2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011). Commuting flight
   distances were estimated at 961.5 +/- 1041.9 m, and variations were
   mainly explained by age and temperature (they decreased with lower
   temperatures and were lower for first-winter birds). Three cold spells
   occurred in 2009/2010; 80\% of woodcocks monitored that winter showed
   escape flights, moving > 20 km, and went back to their previous
   wintering place when the effects of cold spells finished (about 8 days
   later). Of monitored woodcocks, 54.9\% survived the winter. The most
   frequent cause of death was hunting, affecting mainly first-winter
   birds. Woodcock survival was lower in areas with more hunting days per
   week, and in Mediterranean than in Atlantic climate regions. Our results
   highlight the importance of monitoring survival and factors affecting
   it. Also, these results underline the importance of developing future
   studies to understand the importance of Mediterranean regions, the use
   of refuge places during cold spells, and hunting pressure there.}},

Title = {{Space invaders: House Sparrow densities along three urban-agricultural
   landscapes}},

Abstract = {{One of the most successful avian urban invaders is the House Sparrow
   (Passer domesticus). Here, we examine House Sparrow numbers in the
   urban-agricultural landscape of three cities, one where the sparrow is
   native (Barcelona) and two where it is nonnative (Los Angeles, Mexico
   City), comparing between five different land classes based on land-use,
   location relative to urban center, and urbanization intensity. We
   estimated sparrow densities using distance-sampling corrected procedures
   and compared sparrow numbers between the three cities and between the
   land classes within each city. This two-year survey showed the highest
   density of sparrows occurring in Mexico City and the lowest in Los
   Angeles. In both cities where the sparrow is nonnative, we recorded the
   greatest abundances in highly urbanized areas. In Barcelona, where the
   sparrow is native, abundances did not differ among land classes. We also
   related sparrow numbers to specific environmental variables, describing
   vegetation structure, urban infrastructure, and human activity, using
   classification and regression trees. We found several variables related
   to differences in House Sparrow abundances among the three cities. For
   Los Angeles and Mexico City, the most important variables explaining
   House Sparrow numbers were urban infrastructure (i.e., maximum building
   height, high urbanization) and/or human activity (i.e., pedestrians),
   all of which related positively with sparrow abundance. For Barcelona,
   sparrow numbers showed both positive and negative relationships with
   vegetation (i.e., tree abundance, maximum tree height, maximum
   herbaceous plant height) and human-related variables (i.e., cars,
   pedestrians). Although the scope of this study is geographically limited
   to three cities, our results suggest that House Sparrow numbers between
   cities and land classes areas vary considerably, and are likely
   determined by a complex array of variables. Our study provides some
   insight to the growth and decline of House Sparrow populations in their
   nonnative and native ranges, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is one of the longest
   annual avian surveys and has the greatest spatiotemporally extensive
   coverage in the Western Hemisphere. Although this important survey
   provides trend estimates for more than 400 species, it has limited
   coverage in the boreal forest and biases in representation and
   detectability that complicate inference. Thus, there is a need to
   evaluate the potential of new technologies and analytical approaches to
   increase coverage and improve monitoring efficiency. We documented
   variation in counts between BBS surveys (hereafter ``human BBS{''}) and
   different on-road and forest-edge surveys using autonomous recording
   units (ARUs) from 3 routes in the Northwest Territories, Canada.
   Specifically, we quantified percent differences (i.e., bias in counts)
   in species richness, abundance indices of birds, and species-specific
   variation in counts between human BBS and ARU-based surveys conducted
   on-road and at the forest edge at different dates and times of day. We
   also generated on-road effective detection radius (EDR) estimates for 15
   species and tested for species-specific differences in EDR to explain
   bias in counts between on-road and forest-edge ARU surveys. Overall,
   species richness and abundance indices in human BBS surveys were higher
   than forest-edge ARU surveys conducted simultaneously and when similar
   forest-edge ARU surveys were conducted at sunset and a week earlier in
   June. However, there was no difference when comparing values from human
   BBS with on-road ARU BBS and forest-edge ARU surveys conducted at
   sunrise. Extracting the maximum count per species from 4 types of
   3-minute forest-edge surveys increased counts by 62\% and 64\% for
   species richness and abundance indices, respectively, relative to human
   BBS, but the importance of this bias differed considerably among the 10
   most common species in the study area. Our results suggest that
   false-negative bias in species detection could be corrected with
   appropriate methods, and ARUs deployed at the forest edge near BBS stops
   could be used to increase data quality of on-road surveys. When combined
   with appropriate correction factors to adjust for surveys done at the
   forest edge, ARUs could also be used to increase the geographic coverage
   of boreal surveys by allowing inexperienced volunteers to collect BBS
   data along winter or secondary roads in remote locations.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbances can affect species of conservation concern by
   influencing their behavior. Of special concern is the possibility that
   noise from anthropogenic structures in grassland habitats, such as wind
   turbines and roads, may affect the propagation of the low-frequency boom
   chorus of lekking male Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido). We
   used sound pressure levels from acoustic recordings taken at 10 leks in
   the Nebraska Sandhills, USA during 2013 and 2014 in a SPreAD-GIS sound
   propagation model to make spatial projections of the boom chorus under a
   variety of conditions including landscape composition, conspecific
   attendance, and weather. We then used sets of linear mixed models in a
   model selection process to determine how background noise, female and
   male lek attendance, time of day, relative humidity, air temperature,
   and wind speed affected the area of chorus propagation. The predicted
   area of propagation decreased with increasing background noise (beta =
   -0.09, SE = 0.04) and increased with greater female lek attendance (beta
   = 0.09, SE = 0.03), higher levels of relatively humidity (beta = 0.07,
   SE = 0.03), and higher air temperatures (beta = 0.05, SE = 0.03). Our
   analyses provide new insight on how acoustic, social, and meteorological
   factors influence an important reproductive behavior in an imperiled
   prairie grouse.}},

Abstract = {{The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol
   recommends point counts consisting of a 5-min passive observation
   period, meant to be free of broadcast bias, followed by call broadcasts
   to entice elusive species to reveal their presence. Prior to this
   protocol, some monitoring programs used point counts with broadcasts
   during the first 5 min of 10-min counts, and have since used 15-min
   counts with an initial 5-min passive period (P-1) followed by 5 min of
   broadcasts (B) and a second 5-min passive period (P-2) to ensure
   consistency across years and programs. Influence of timing of broadcasts
   within point counts and point count duration, however, have rarely been
   assessed. Using data from 23,973 broadcast-assisted 15-min point counts
   conducted throughout the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region between 2008
   and 2016 by Bird Studies Canada's Marsh Monitoring Program and Central
   Michigan University's Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program, we
   estimated detection probabilities of individuals for 14 marsh breeding
   bird species during P1B compared to BP2, P-1 compared to P-2, and P1B
   compared to P-1 BP2. For six broadcast species and American Bittern
   (Botaurus lentiginosus), we found no significant difference in detection
   during P1B compared to BP2, and no significant difference in four of the
   same seven species during P-1 compared to P-2. We observed small but
   significant differences in detection for 7 of 14 species during P1B
   compared to P1BP2. We conclude that differences in timing of broadcasts
   causes no bias based on counts from entire 10-minute surveys, although
   P1B should be favored over BP2 because the same amount of effort in P1B
   avoids broadcast bias in all broadcast species, and 10-min surveys are
   superior to 15-min surveys because modest gains in detection of some
   species does not warrant the additional effort. We recommend point
   counts consisting of 5 min of passive observation followed by
   broadcasts, consistent with the standardized marsh bird protocol, for
   surveying marsh breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Automated recording units are increasingly being used to sample wildlife
   populations. These devices can produce large amounts of data that are
   difficult to process manually. However, the information in the
   recordings can be summarized with semiautomated sound recognition
   software. Our objective was to assess the utility of the semiautomated
   bird song recognizers to produce data useful for conservation and
   sustainable forest management applications. We compared detection data
   generated from expert-interpreted recordings of bird songs collected
   with automated recording units and data derived from a semiautomated
   recognition process. We recorded bird songs at 109 sites in boreal
   forest in 2013 and 2014 using automated recording units. We developed
   bird-song recognizers for 10 species using Song Scope software (Wildlife
   Acoustics) and each recognizer was used to scan a set of recordings that
   was also interpreted manually by an expert in birdsong identification.
   We used occupancy models to estimate the detection probability
   associated with each method. Based on these detection probability
   estimates we produced cumulative detection probability curves. In a
   second analysis we estimated detection probability of bird song
   recognizers using multiple 10-minute recordings for a single station and
   visit (35-63, 10-minute recordings in each of four one-week periods).
   Results show that the detection probability of most species from single
   10-min recordings is substantially higher using expert-interpreted bird
   song recordings than using the song recognizer software. However, our
   results also indicate that detection probabilities for song recognizers
   can be significantly improved by using more than a single 10-minute
   recording, which can be easily done with little additional cost with the
   automate procedure. Based on these results we suggest that automated
   recording units and song recognizer software can be valuable tools to
   estimate detection probability and occupancy of boreal forest birds,
   when sampling for sufficiently long periods.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge for protected areas is providing wildlife with enough
   suitable habitat to cope with stochastic environment and increased
   pressure from the surrounding landscapes. In this study, we addressed
   changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus
   magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile.
   We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers
   during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and
   assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and
   quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence
   reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation
   in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of
   Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2\% in Conguillio National Park,
   but increasing by 34.3\% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers
   responded to forest conditions within each park such that their
   abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large
   PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria
   araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests
   that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have
   responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest
   fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic
   events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings
   suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires
   expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern
   Chile.}},

Abstract = {{Emulating natural disturbance has become a paradigm for biodiversity
   retention in forest management. This study evaluates the extent to which
   harvest management practices have created stands that emulate natural
   fire disturbance from the perspective of bird communities in Ontario,
   Canada. We compared the relative abundance of forest landbirds at the
   stand level in mature forest (> 80 years old) with that in
   early-regenerating (0-20 years) and midregenerating (21-80 years)
   forests originating from fire or timber harvest across the boreal forest
   of Ontario using over 7000 point counts. Our results indicate that
   forest harvest management practices in Ontario have created stands that
   only partially emulate natural fire disturbances in terms of the bird
   community composition. Total bird abundance and species richness were
   significantly lower postharvest than postfire in midregenerating
   forests, although they did not differ in early-regenerating stands.
   Species-level comparisons revealed several differences between
   postharvest and postfire stands, as well as among age classes. Although
   no species was completely missing from any stand type, 8\% of species in
   early-and 34\% in midregenerating stands were detected significantly
   less often in postharvest than postfire forests. Some other species were
   found significantly more often in postharvest stands, while the majority
   of species detected (84\% and 71\% in early-and midregenerating stands,
   respectively) showed no significant difference between disturbance
   types. Collectively, these results suggest that widespread replacement
   of fire with logging as the dominant disturbance type will shift the
   relative abundance of species within Ontario's boreal forest bird
   community. Quantifying the population-level implications of these shifts
   requires extrapolating these stand level effects to the landscape level,
   while considering the actual or anticipated abundance and distribution
   of forest age classes across the province under different forest
   management regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging strategies and diet selection play an essential role in
   individual survival and reproductive success. The study of feeding
   ecology becomes crucial when it concerns endangered species such as the
   Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax), whose populations are suffering strong
   declines as a consequence of agricultural intensification. Despite the
   fact that several populations are overwintering in areas affected by
   agricultural transformation, nothing is known about how feeding behavior
   responds to these changes. We studied for the first time the winter diet
   composition of the Little Bustard in Spain and compared it between areas
   with two different farming systems: dry and irrigated farmland. Diet was
   studied through the micro-histological analysis of 357 droppings
   collected in 16 locations across the wintering range of the Little
   Bustard in Spain. Up to 62 plant species were identified. Most consumed
   species were cultivated legumes (46.7\%) and dicotyledon weeds (45.6\%),
   while monocotyledons were scarcely consumed (7.7\%). Diet composition
   differed significantly between dry and irrigated farmland areas. In
   irrigated areas, diet was mainly composed of legumes, in particular
   alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In contrast, in dry farmland areas diet was
   more diverse, composed mainly of weeds (Compositae, Papaveraceae, and
   Cruciferae) and also cultivated legumes, particularly vetch (Vicia
   sativa). These results suggest that legume crops could be an effective
   measure to improve habitat quality in areas with scarce food resources.
   However, in the case of irrigated areas, the strong reliance on alfalfa
   could make the Little Bustard more vulnerable to changes in land use.
   This study is the first step to understand the winter trophic
   requirements of the endangered Little Bustard, but further research is
   necessary to understand the food requirements of this species during the
   entire annual cycle.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing density of the Northern Mealy Amazon in three forest
   types of a modified rainforest landscape in Mesoamerica}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The high rate of conversion of tropical moist forest to secondary forest
   makes it imperative to evaluate forest metric relationships of species
   dependent on primary, old-growth forest. The threatened Northern Mealy
   Amazon (Amazona guatemalae) is the largest mainland parrot, and occurs
   in tropical moist forests of Mesoamerica that are increasingly being
   converted to secondary forest. However, the consequences of forest
   conversion for this recently taxonomically separated parrot species are
   poorly understood. We measured forest metrics of primary evergreen,
   riparian, and secondary tropical moist forest in Los Chimalapas, Mexico.
   We also used point counts to estimate density of Northern Mealy Amazons
   in each forest type during the nonbreeding (Sept 2013) and breeding
   (March 2014) seasons. We then examined how parrot density was influenced
   by forest structure and composition, and how parrots used forest types
   within tropical moist forest. Overall, parrot density was high in the
   breeding season, with few parrots present during the nonbreeding season.
   During the breeding season, primary forest had significantly greater
   density of 18.9 parrots/km(2) in evergreen forest and 35.9 parrots/km(2)
   in riparian forest, compared with only 3.4 parrots/km(2) in secondary
   forest. Secondary forest had significantly lower tree species richness,
   density, diameter, total height, and major branch ramification height,
   as well as distinct tree species composition compared with both types of
   primary forest. The number of parrots recorded at point counts was
   related to density of large, tall trees, characteristic of primary
   forest, and parrots used riparian forest more than expected by
   availability. Hence, the increased conversion of tropical moist forest
   to secondary forest is likely to lead to reduced densities of
   forest-dependent species such as the Northern Mealy Amazon. Furthermore,
   the species' requirement for primary tropical moist forest highlights
   the need to reevaluate conservation status of the Northern Mealy Amazon,
   and implement strategies to reduce forest conversion.}},

Abstract = {{During the past several decades, numbers of Western Grebes (Aechmophorus
   occidentalis) have declined throughout their breeding and wintering
   ranges in North America. We estimated Western Grebe abundance and
   documented habitat factors between 2007 and 2009 from 43 lakes in
   Alberta, Canada where Western Grebes historically have occurred, to (1)
   compare Western Grebe abundance with the relative probability of
   persistence, and (2) identify habitat correlates of grebe abundance. The
   relative probability of Western Grebe persistence was correlated with
   abundance in the study area, although only 19\% of the variation in
   persistence probability was explained by abundance. Western Grebe
   abundance was positively correlated with the shoreline extent of
   emergent bulrush (Scirpus lacustris), which is consistent with past
   studies and underlies the importance of protecting emergent vegetation
   in efforts to conserve Western Grebes. Grebe abundance also was
   positively correlated with a longer shoreline perimeter, but was
   inversely correlated with the amount of forested backshore, which
   occurred on lakes primarily at the northern margins of Western Grebe
   range. The amount of backshore development was positively associated
   with Western Grebe abundance, which might reflect a preference for
   similar lake characteristics by humans and grebes. These relationships
   are important to consider in the context of implementing and managing
   recovery of the Western Grebe in Alberta.}},

Abstract = {{Gray-cheeked Thrushes breeding on Newfoundland are purported to be a
   distinct subspecies (Catharus minimus minimus) and have declined
   precipitously since the 1980s. To assess the validity of Gray-cheeked
   Thrush subspecies we collected blood samples and morphological
   measurements from 51 individuals captured at 15 sites in Newfoundland
   and Labrador (2013-2015). Analysis of mitochondrial (ND2) and nuclear
   intron (ADAM-TS 6, FIB7) sequences from these and additional samples
   from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador, Quebec, Alaska, and Siberia
   showed low genetic variation at both nuclear loci, and shallow
   mitochondrial divergence between subspecies; there were no shared
   haplotypes between thrushes from Newfoundland / Nova Scotia (n = 41) and
   those from western Labrador and further west (n = 24). Thrushes from
   Newfoundland also had shorter wing chords, tails, and culmens and less
   black in the mandible compared to those from western Labrador and
   Quebec. Samples from the southeast coast of Labrador (n = 13) included
   ND2 haplotypes both from Newfoundland and western Labrador plus one
   putative hybrid that was phenotypically a Gray-cheeked Thrush but that
   had a Bicknell's Thrush (C. bicknelli) ND2 haplotype and was
   heterozygous at a segregating site in FIB7. We detected thrushes during
   point counts at 7 of 24 sites on Newfoundland, but failed to detect them
   at 10 historically occupied sites on Newfoundland or in the reported
   distribution gap between subspecies in Labrador. Sites where thrushes
   have apparently disappeared had less shrub habitat within 1250 m and
   more large broadleaf trees within territory-scale areas compared to
   sites where they persist. Additionally, red squirrels (Tamiasciurus
   hudsonicus) are an introduced species on Newfoundland and thrush
   occurrence was > 3x higher at sites where red squirrels were not
   detected. Our results support previous designations of C. m. minimus
   from Newfoundland and southeastern Labrador as a subspecies distinct
   from C. m. aliciae found further west.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous recording units (ARUs) show promise for improving the spatial
   and temporal coverage of biodiversity monitoring programs, and for
   improving the resolution with which the behaviors of animals can be
   monitored on small spatial scales. Most ARUs, however, provide the user
   with little to no ability to determine the direction of an incoming
   sound, a shortcoming that limits the utility of ARU recordings for
   assessing the abundance of animals. We present a recording system
   constructed from two Wildlife Acoustics SM3 recording units that can
   estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of an incoming signal with high
   accuracy. Field tests of this system revealed that 95\% of sounds were
   estimated within 12 degrees of the true DOA in the azimuth angle and 9
   degrees in the elevation angle, and that the system was largely robust
   to background noise and accurate to at least 30 m. We tested the ability
   of the system to discriminate up to four simulated birds singing
   simultaneously and show that the system generally performed well at this
   task, but, as expected, fainter and longer sounds were more likely to be
   overlapped and therefore undetected by the system. We propose that a
   microphone system that can estimate the DOA of sounds, such as the
   system presented here, may improve the ability of ARUs to assess
   abundance during biodiversity surveys by facilitating more accurate
   localization of sounds in three dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Local scale movement behavior is an important basis to predict
   large-scale bird movements in heterogeneous landscapes. Here we
   conducted playback experiments using mobbing calls to estimate the
   probability that forest birds would cross a 50-m urban area during three
   seasons (breeding, dispersal, and wintering seasons) with varying
   amounts of tree cover, building area, and electric wire density. We
   examined the responses of four forest resident species: Marsh Tit
   (Poecile palustris), Varied Tit (Sittiparus varius), Japanese Tit (P.
   minor), and Eurasian Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) in central Hokkaido,
   northern Japan. We carried out and analyzed 250 playback experiments
   that attracted 618 individuals. Our results showed that tree cover
   increased the crossing probability of three species other than Varied
   Tit. Building area and electric wire density had no detectable effect on
   crossing probability for four species. Seasonal difference in the
   crossing probability was found only for Varied Tit, and the probability
   was the highest in the breeding season. These results suggest that the
   positive effect of tree cover on the crossing probability would be
   consistent across seasons. We therefore conclude that planting trees
   would be an effective way to promote forest bird movement within an
   urban landscape.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic surveys are a widely used sampling tool in ecological research
   and monitoring. They are used to monitor populations and ecosystems and
   to study various aspects of animal behavior. Autonomous recording units
   (ARUs) can record sound in most environments and are increasingly used
   by researchers to conduct acoustic surveys for birds. In this review, we
   summarize the use of ARUs in avian ecological research and synthesize
   current knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of this technology. ARUs
   enable researchers to do more repeat visits with less time spent in the
   field, with the added benefits of a permanent record of the data
   collected and reduced observer bias. They are useful in remote locations
   and for targeting rare species. ARUs are mostly comparable to human
   observers in terms of species richness, but in some cases, they detect
   fewer species and at shorter distances. Drawbacks of ARUs include the
   cost of equipment, storage of recordings, loss of data if units fail,
   and potential sampling trade-offs in spatial vs. temporal coverage. ARUs
   generate large data sets of audio recordings, but advances in automated
   species recognition and acoustic processing techniques are contributing
   to make the processing time manageable. Future applications of ARUs
   include biodiversity monitoring and studying habitat use, animal
   movement, and various behavioral ecology questions based on vocalization
   activity. ARUs have the potential to make significant advances in avian
   ecological research and to be used in more innovative ways than simply
   as a substitute for a human observer in the field.}},

Title = {{The Motus Wildlife Tracking System: a collaborative research network to
   enhance the understanding of wildlife movement}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We describe a new collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking
   System (Motus; https://motus.org), which is an international network of
   researchers using coordinated automated radio-telemetry arrays to study
   movements of small flying organisms including birds, bats, and insects,
   at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. Radio-telemetry has been a
   cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of
   current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and
   satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track
   movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision.
   Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital
   coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by
   allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously
   across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that
   collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations
   over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at
   sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and
   archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository.
   Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously,
   Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions
   that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and
   even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000
   individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been
   tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and
   comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all
   phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and
   at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the
   movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus
   network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners
   and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus
   can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated
   approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement
   biology and ecology.}},

Title = {{Microphone variability and degradation: implications for monitoring

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are emerging as an effective tool for
   avian population monitoring and research. Although ARU technology is
   being rapidly adopted, there is a need to establish whether variation in
   ARU components and their degradation with use might introduce detection
   biases that would affect long-term monitoring and research projects. We
   assessed whether microphone sensitivity impacted the probability of
   detecting bird vocalizations by broadcasting a sequence of 12 calls
   toward an array of commercially available ARUs equipped with microphones
   of varying sensitivities under three levels (32 dBA, 42 dBA, and 50 dBA)
   of experimentally induced noise conditions selected to reflect the range
   of noise levels commonly encountered during avian surveys. We used
   binomial regression to examine factors influencing probability of
   detection for each species and used these to examine the impact of
   microphone sensitivity on the effective detection area (ha) for each
   species. Microphone sensitivity loss reduced detection probability for
   all species examined, but the magnitude of the effect varied between
   species and often interacted with distance. Microphone sensitivity loss
   reduced the effective detection area by an average of 25\% for
   microphones just beyond manufacturer specifications (-5 dBV) and by an
   average of 66\% for severely compromised microphones (-20 dBV).
   Microphone sensitivity loss appeared to be more problematic for low
   frequency calls where reduction in the effective detection area occurred
   most rapidly. Microphone degradation poses a source of variation in
   avian surveys made with ARUs that will require regular measurement of
   microphone sensitivity and criteria for microphone replacement to ensure
   scientifically reproducible results. We recommend that research and
   monitoring projects employing ARUs test their microphones regularly,
   replace microphones with declining sensitivity, and record sensitivity
   as a potential covariate in statistical analyses of acoustic data.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic recordings are increasingly used to quantify occupancy and
   abundance in avian monitoring and research. The recent development of
   relatively inexpensive programmable autonomous recording units (ARUs)
   has further increased the utility of acoustic recording technologies.
   Despite their potential advantages, persistent questions remain as to
   how comparable data are between ARUs and traditional (human observer)
   point counts. We suggest that differences in counts obtained from ARUs
   versus human observers primarily stem from differences in the effective
   detection radius of humans (EDRH) versus ARUs (EDRA). We describe how
   paired sampling can be used in conjunction with generalized linear (GLM)
   or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to estimate correction factors
   (delta) to remove biases between ARUs and traditional point counts.
   Furthermore, if human observers conduct distance estimation, we show
   that density estimates can be derived from single ARUs by estimating
   EDRA as a function of EDRH and delta, thus providing alternatives to
   more complicated and expensive approaches. We demonstrate our approach
   using data from 363 point count stations in 105 unique boreal study
   sites at which field staff conducted point count surveys that were
   simultaneously recorded by an ARU and later transcribed in the lab.
   Finally, we used repeated random subsampling of the data to split the
   data into model creation (70\%) and validation (30\%) subsets to
   iteratively estimate delta and validate density estimates from ARUs
   against densities calculated from human observers at the same
   independent validation locations. We modeled density of 35 species of
   boreal forest birds and show that incorporating delta in statistical
   offsets successfully removes systematic biases in estimated avian counts
   and/or density between human and ARU derived surveys. Our method is
   therefore easily implemented and will facilitate the integration of ARU
   and human observer point count data, facilitating expanded monitoring
   efforts and meta-analyses with historic point count data.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Citizen science projects provide a vast amount of biological data that
   can be used to model population trends of species. Robust statistical
   modeling techniques are necessary to account for multiple sources of
   bias inherent to the data. One such citizen science project, eBird, is
   an online database of avian checklist data entered by birdwatchers from
   discrete locations and visits. The eBird dataset may be large enough to
   fill information gaps left by other monitoring programs if biases in the
   data are modeled appropriately and if the models can be validated
   against reliable survey data. We compared eBird and North American
   Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from southern Ontario to determine if
   patterns in annual indices and long-term trends were similar for 22
   species that reach the northern limit of their range in that region.
   Mixed-effects models were used to address varying observer skill and
   uneven geographic coverage in eBird, and the number of species per
   checklist was used as a covariate to represent effort and to accommodate
   historic lists lacking effort information. The average Pearson's
   correlation coefficient between eBird and BBS annual indices across
   species was 0.35, and the correlation between trends estimated from the
   annual indices was 0.72. eBird data generally agreed with BBS data with
   the exception of two common species that showed opposite trends, several
   species with low detection rates, and for two species with little
   long-term change in occurrence based on BBS data. Our results suggest
   that eBird data can be used to generate long-term trends that could
   complement data from traditional surveys, yet more work is needed to
   understand circumstances that lead to disagreement between eBird and
   other surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding birds vocalize to find mates and establish and defend
   territories, but these same critical communications may also attract
   predators or brood parasites, placing birds in a cruel bind. Although
   vigilant birds may better maintain social relationships with mates and
   neighbors through frequent vocalizations, reticent birds may reduce risk
   to their nests by being relatively quiet and making infrequent
   vocalizations. Selection for vocalization patterns that minimize brood
   parasitism might be particularly strong for birds that are unable to
   fledge both their own young and the parasite. Temporal plasticity in the
   frequency of vocalizations near nests, however, may allow birds to
   balance trade-offs and optimize nest-defense strategies. The
   Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) is an endangered songbird that
   faces intensive brood parasitism in areas where Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) are present. Vireo nests that produce cowbird
   fledglings always fail to fledge vireo young. We recorded vocalizations
   at vireo nests across three nesting stages (building, laying, and early
   incubation) and three periods of the day (morning, midday, and evening)
   and compared vocalization frequency with eventual depredation or
   parasitism fate as well as local cowbird density to test two hypotheses.
   The predator-attraction hypothesis predicts that predators will be
   attracted by frequent vocalizations, whereas cowbirds will parasitize
   nests with relatively quiet parents and less predation risk; thus,
   vireos will experience trade-offs between reticence and vigilance in
   mediating specific risks. The parasite-assessment hypothesis predicts
   that vireos will become more secretive as local cowbird densities
   increase. Vireo vocalization response to nest predation and parasitism
   risk interacted with nest stage, and we found little evidence of risk
   mediation through vocalizations except during the building stage.
   Vireos, however, did benefit overall by optimizing temporal patterns in
   vocalizations. Vireo nests were less likely to be depredated or
   parasitized if males vocalized most during laying and least during the
   middle of the day. Birds vocalized more during the midday and less
   during the laying period when local cowbird densities were higher,
   however, perhaps demonstrating limited plasticity in social
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{Migratory bird species breeding in the Palearctic and overwintering in
   sub-Saharan Africa face multiple conservation challenges. As a result,
   many of these species have declined in recent decades, some
   dramatically. We therefore used the best available database for the
   distribution of 68 passerine migrants in sub-Saharan Africa to determine
   priority regions for their conservation. After modeling each species'
   distribution using BIOMOD software, we entered the resulting species
   distributions at a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid resolution into MARXAN
   software. We then used several different selection procedures that
   varied the boundary length modifier, species penalty factor, and the
   inclusion of grid cells with high human footprint and with protected
   areas. While results differed between selection procedures, four main
   regions were regularly selected: (1) one centered on southern Mali; (2)
   one including Eritrea, central Sudan, and northern Ethiopia; (3) one
   encompassing southwestern Kenya and much of Tanzania and Uganda; and (4)
   one including much of Zimbabwe and southwestern Zambia. We recommend
   that these four regions become priority regions for research and
   conservation efforts for the bird species considered in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on bird-window collisions have generally drawn inferences about
   species' differential vulnerability from collision tallies. However,
   this common methodology is potentially biased because the number of
   collisions may simply reflect prevalence of species at the study site
   rather than species-specific vulnerability. Building on recent studies
   of abundance and collision rates, we offered a complementary methodology
   based on point count data that could be widely applied alongside carcass
   surveys. Additionally, we broadened our analysis beyond previously
   applied taxonomic and migratory classifications to include functional
   classifications of feeding guild, breeding status, and synanthropy. Our
   null hypothesis was that collision frequencies reflect a species' or
   classification group's prevalence at study sites. To test this
   possibility, we used collision data collected at three sites in the
   Research Triangle Area of North Carolina, United States. At one of these
   sites, Duke University's Main Campus, we also gathered relative
   abundances from the local bird community to develop a case study
   assessment of how background prevalence compared to number of
   collisions. Using the larger, three-site dataset, we developed an
   initial picture of collision susceptibility based solely on frequency,
   the standard practice. Then, by bootstrapping our Duke abundance data,
   we generated confidence intervals that simulated collision based on
   chance versus prevalence. We identified several instances where
   collision tallies produced misleading perception of species-specific
   vulnerability. In the most extreme case, frequencies from our Triangle
   Area dataset indicated locally breeding species were highly vulnerable
   to collisions while our abundance-based case study suggested this same
   group was actually adept at avoiding collisions. Through our case study,
   we also found that foliage gleaning was linked to increased risk, and
   omnivory and ground foraging were associated with decreased risk.
   Although our results are based on a limited sample, we argue that
   abundance needs to be incorporated into future studies and recommend
   point counts as a noninvasive and adaptable alternative to area-searches
   and mist netting.}},

Abstract = {{Point counts are one of the most commonly used methods for assessing
   bird abundance. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being
   used as a replacement for human-based point counts. Previous studies
   have compared the relative benefits of human versus ARU-based point
   count methods, primarily with the goal of understanding differences in
   species richness and the abundance of individuals over an unlimited
   distance. What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize
   these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same
   analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We
   compared detection distances between human observers in the field and
   four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2,
   SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various
   avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also
   investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to
   simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction
   factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs
   relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the
   field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although
   detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We
   provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose
   methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.}},

Abstract = {{Human disturbance may cause significant declines in animal populations.
   The Blue-crowned Laughingthrush (Garrulax courtoisi) is critically
   endangered and restricted to a small area in Wuyuan, Jiangxi Province,
   China. Disturbance from photographers in the main breeding sites were
   severe in the past few years. We studied nest-site selection in nine
   breeding colonies in relation to disturbance by bird photographers. We
   compared the nest tree species and nest height above ground in Shimen
   (SM), the largest and most disturbed site, with the other eight sites.
   Birds in SM were more selective in nest tree species than in the other
   sites, they also nested much further from the nearest village building.
   Nest height above ground at SM was greater than at the other sites and
   itself in 2004 when there were almost no visitors. These results suggest
   that disturbance from birding visitors may exacerbate the endangered
   status of this bird. Management of bird visitors in a small breeding
   area of endangered species should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced effects on lowland conifer forests in hemiboreal regions
   are increasing because of expanded use of these northern ecosystems for
   raw materials, energy, and minerals as well as the potential effects of
   climatic changes. These forests support many breeding bird species
   across the Holarctic and allow the persistence of several boreal bird
   species in hemiboreal and even temperate regions. These bird species are
   of particular conservation concern as shifting patterns northward in
   forest composition caused by climate change will likely affect their
   populations. However, effective management and conservation options are
   limited because the specifics of these species' breeding habitats are
   not well understood. We modeled and mapped habitat suitability for 11
   species of boreal birds that breed in the lowland conifer forests of the
   Agassiz Lowlands Ecological Subsection in northern Minnesota and are
   likely to have reduced breeding habitat in the future: Spruce Grouse
   (Falcipennis canadensis), Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus),
   Olivesided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher
   (Empidonax flaviventris), Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus),
   Goldencrowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus
   calendula), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Connecticut Warbler
   (Oporornis agilis), Palm Warbler (Setophaga palmarum), and Dark-eyed
   Junco (Junco hyemalis). Sets of 7 to 16 potential environmental
   covariates, including both stand-level and landscape attributes, were
   used to develop individual species models. Within this lowland
   conifer-dominated ecosystem, we found significant selection for specific
   forest and landscape characteristics by all but one of these species,
   with the best models including between one and nine variables. Habitat
   suitability maps were developed from these models and predictions tested
   with an independent dataset. Model performance depended on species,
   correctly predicting 56-96\% of test data. We present a map combining
   suitability scores for five species of conservation concern that has
   been used for conservation planning and management opportunities across
   a broad, lowland forest landscape. We recommend managers utilize the
   detailed model development and validation framework to address local and
   regional conservation issues.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of
   species is critical to developing effective management plans for
   conservation. Our goal was to quantify the distribution and abundance of
   Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), a threatened old-forest
   associate in Alberta, Canada. The Canada Warbler has declined across its
   range, including in Alberta where habitat loss and alteration from urban
   expansion, forestry, and energy development are changing the forest
   landscape. We used 110,427 point count survey visits from 32,287 unique
   survey stations to model local-level (150-m radius circular buffers) and
   stand-level (564-m radius circular buffers) habitat associations of the
   Canada Warbler. We found that habitat supporting higher densities of
   Canada Warblers was locally concentrated yet broadly distributed across
   Alberta's boreal forest region. Canada Warblers were most commonly
   associated with older deciduous forest at the local scale, particularly
   near small, incised streams, and greater amounts of deciduous forest at
   the stand scale. Predicted density was lower in other forest types and
   younger age classes measured at the local scale. There was little
   evidence that local-scale fragmentation (i.e., edges created by linear
   features) influenced Canada Warbler abundance. However, current forestry
   practices in the province likely will reduce the availability of Canada
   Warbler habitat over time by cutting old deciduous forest stands. Our
   results suggest that conservation efforts aimed at Canada Warbler focus
   on retaining large stands of old deciduous forest, specifically stands
   adjacent to streams, by increasing the width of deciduous retention
   buffers along streams during harvest and increasing the size and number
   of old forest residual patches in harvested stands.}},

Title = {{Prioritizing tropical habitats for long-distance migratory songbirds: an
   assessment of habitat quality at a stopover site in Colombia}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Long-distance migratory birds are declining globally and migration has
   been identified as the primary source of mortality in this group.
   Despite this, our lack of knowledge of habitat use and quality at
   stopovers, i.e., sites where the energy for migration is accumulated,
   remains a barrier to designing appropriate conservation measures,
   especially in tropical regions. There is therefore an urgent need to
   assess stopover habitat quality and concurrently identify efficient and
   cost-effective methods for doing so. Given that fuel deposition rates
   directly influence stopover duration, departure fuel load, and
   subsequent speed of migration, they are expected to provide a direct
   measure of habitat quality and have the advantage of being measurable
   through body-mass changes. Here, we examined seven potential indicators
   of quality, including body-mass change, for two ecologically distinct
   Neotropical migratory landbirds on stopover in shade-coffee plantations
   and tropical humid premontane forest during spring migration in
   Colombia: (1) rate of body-mass change; (2) foraging rate; (3) recapture
   rate; (4) density; (5) flock size; (6) age and sex ratios; and (7)
   body-mass distribution. We found higher rates of mass change in
   premontane forest than in shade-coffee in Tennessee Warbler Oreothlypis
   peregrina, a difference that was mirrored in higher densities and body
   masses in forest. In Gray-cheeked Thrush Catharus minimus, a lack of
   recaptures in shade-coffee and higher densities in forest, also
   suggested that forest provided superior fueling conditions. For a
   reliable assessment of habitat quality, we therefore recommend using a
   suite of indicators, taking into account each species' ecology and
   methodological considerations. Our results also imply that birds
   stopping over in lower quality habitats may spend a longer time
   migrating and require more stopovers, potentially leading to important
   carryover effects on reproductive fitness. Evaluating habitat quality is
   therefore imperative prior to defining the conservation value of newly
   identified stopover regions.}},

   precision of trends}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Temporal replicate counts are often aggregated to improve model fit by
   reducing zero-inflation and count variability, and in the case of
   migration counts collected hourly throughout a migration, allows one to
   ignore nonindependence. However, aggregation can represent a loss of
   potentially useful information on the hourly or seasonal distribution of
   counts, which might impact our ability to estimate reliable trends. We
   simulated 20-year hourly raptor migration count datasets with known rate
   of change to test the effect of aggregating hourly counts to daily or
   annual totals on our ability to recover known trend. We simulated data
   for three types of species, to test whether results varied with species
   abundance or migration strategy: a commonly detected species, e.g.,
   Northern Harrier, Circus cyaneus; a rarely detected species, e.g.,
   Peregrine Falcon, Falco peregrinus; and a species typically counted in
   large aggregations with overdispersed counts, e.g., Broad-winged Hawk,
   Buteo platypterus. We compared accuracy and precision of estimated
   trends across species and count types (hourly/daily/annual) using
   hierarchical models that assumed a Poisson, negative binomial (NB) or
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) count distribution. We found
   little benefit of modeling zero-inflation or of modeling the hourly
   distribution of migration counts. For the rare species, trends analyzed
   using daily totals and an NB or ZINB data distribution resulted in a
   higher probability of detecting an accurate and precise trend. In
   contrast, trends of the common and overdispersed species benefited from
   aggregation to annual totals, and for the overdispersed species in
   particular, trends estimating using annual totals were more precise, and
   resulted in lower probabilities of estimating a trend (1) in the wrong
   direction, or (2) with credible intervals that excluded the true trend,
   as compared with hourly and daily counts.}},

Title = {{Factors driving territory size and breeding success in a threatened
   migratory songbird, the Canada Warbler}},

Abstract = {{Successful conservation of migratory birds demands we understand how
   habitat factors on the breeding grounds influences breeding success.
   Multiple factors are known to directly influence breeding success in
   territorial songbirds. For example, greater food availability and fewer
   predators can have direct effects on breeding success. However, many of
   these same habitat factors can also result in higher conspecific density
   that may ultimately reduce breeding success through density dependence.
   In this case, there is a negative indirect effect of habitat on breeding
   success through its effects on conspecific density and territory size.
   Therefore, a key uncertainty facing land managers is whether important
   habitat attributes directly influence breeding success or indirectly
   influence breeding success through territory size. We used
   radio-telemetry, point-counts, vegetation sampling, predator
   observations, and insect sampling over two years to provide data on
   habitat selection of a steeply declining songbird species, the Canada
   Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). These data were then applied in a
   hierarchical path modeling framework and an AIC model selection approach
   to determine the habitat attributes that best predict breeding success.
   Canada Warblers had smaller territories in areas with high shrub cover,
   in the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at shoreline
   sites relative to forest-interior sites and as conspecific density
   increased. Breeding success was lower for birds with smaller
   territories, which suggests competition for limited food resources, but
   there was no direct evidence that food availability influenced territory
   size or breeding success. The negative relationship between shrub cover
   and territory size in our study may arise because these specific habitat
   conditions are spatially heterogeneous, whereby individuals pack into
   patches of preferred breeding habitat scattered throughout the
   landscape, resulting in reduced territory size and an associated
   reduction in resource availability per territory. Our results therefore
   highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects for
   Canada warblers; efforts to increase the amount of breeding habitat may
   ultimately result in lower breeding success if habitat availability is
   limited and negative density dependent effects occur.}},

Title = {{Estimating the migratory stopover abundance of phalaropes in the outer
   Bay of Fundy, Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the abundance and turnover rate of phalaropes
   (Red-necked and Red: Phalaropus lobatus, Phalaropus fulicarius) in the
   outer Bay of Fundy, Canada during migratory stopover in 2008, 2009, and
   2010. We describe estimation procedures designed to calculate size of
   the total stopover population of phalaropes, adjusting for length of
   stay. A total of 29 aerial surveys were flown in two nonoverlapping
   survey regions situated off Brier Island, Nova Scotia and Grand Manan,
   New Brunswick. Line transect distance sampling methods were used to
   obtain abundance estimates at discrete time steps from aerial surveys.
   Estimated number of phalaropes by date ranged between 6000-88,000 in
   2009 and 31,000-127,000 in 2010. To quantify the cumulative number of
   phalaropes in the study area, the temporal dimension of stopover passage
   was incorporated by an analysis of radiotelemetry data to estimate
   length of stay. A total of 27 phalaropes were captured and fitted with
   radio transmitters between 2008 and 2010. Estimated length of stay in
   days was 15.2 +/- 1.91 for a time-integrated stopover population of
   103,496 phalaropes in 2009 and 287,558 in 2010. This is particularly
   relevant to the conservation status of P. lobatus in North America,
   which has been uncertain since the disappearance of that species from an
   important stopover site in 1990. Our findings emphasize the need for
   studies that monitor phalaropes at sea, where they spend the majority of
   their time, as a means to inform effective management and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the Pinyon Jay's (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) importance as a
   pinon tree seed disperser and its long-term population declines,
   pinon-juniper habitat use by Pinyon Jays has been little studied. We
   created home range-and colony-scale habitat suitability models for
   Pinyon Jays in pinon-juniper woodlands at Kirtland Air Force Base and
   White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, USA. Home range-scale models
   included mainly Juniper Woodland and Savanna, Pinon-Juniper, and Pinon
   Woodland vegetation types. Although home range-scale models at the two
   study sites contained similar vegetation types, we found differences
   between colony-scale models in habitat use and within-site diversity.
   Because of topographic and vegetation differences, colony-scale modeling
   incorporated fewer vegetation types and topographic classes for the
   White Sands Missile Range Study site than at Kirtland Air Force Base.
   Predictive colony-scale models overlapped validation colonies by 75.9\%
   and 100\% at the two study sites, indicating good model predictability.
   The large sizes of Pinyon Jay home ranges make year-round, home
   range-scale habitat management challenging. Habitat conservation focused
   at more limited spatial, i.e., colony, and temporal scales, revealed by
   multiscale modeling, could be more feasible and potentially more
   effective than management at the larger home range scale.}},

Title = {{Use of bird carcass removals by urban scavengers to adjust bird-window
   collision estimates}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Carcass removal by scavengers has been identified as one of the largest
   biases in estimating bird mortality from anthropogenic sources. Only two
   studies have examined carcass removal by scavengers in an urban
   environment, and previous estimates of bird-window collision mortality
   at houses have relied on carcass removal rates from wind turbine
   studies. We placed a bird carcass and time-lapse camera at 44 houses in
   Edmonton, Alberta. In total, 166 7-day trials were conducted throughout
   2015. Time-to-event (survival) analysis was used to identify covariates
   that affected removal. The carcass removal rate was determined for use
   in estimating the number of birds killed from bird-window collisions at
   houses in Alberta. In total, 67.5\% of carcasses were removed. The date
   the carcass was placed, the year the house was built, and the level of
   development within 50 m of the house were the covariates that had the
   largest effect on carcass removal. In calculating our removal rate, the
   number of detected carcasses in the first 24 hours was adjusted by 1.47
   to account for removal by scavengers. Previously collected citizen
   science data were used to create an estimate of 957,440 bird deaths each
   year in Alberta as a result of bird-window collisions with houses. This
   number is based on the most detailed bird-window collision study at
   houses to date and a carcass removal study conducted in the same area.
   Similar localized studies across Canada will need to be completed to
   reduce the biases that exist with the previous bird-window collision
   mortality estimate for houses in Canada.}},

Title = {{Projected responses of North American grassland songbirds to climate
   change and habitat availability at their northern range limits in
   Alberta, Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Across North America, grassland songbirds have undergone steep
   population declines over recent decades, commonly attributed to
   agricultural intensification. Understanding the potential interactions
   between the impacts of climate change on the future distributions of
   these species and the availability of suitable vegetation for nesting
   can support improved risk assessments and conservation planning for this
   group of species. We used North American bioclimatic niche models to
   examine future changes in suitable breeding climate for 15 grassland
   songbird species at their current northern range limits along the boreal
   forest-prairie ecotone in Alberta, Canada. Our climate suitability
   projections, combined with the current distribution of native and tame
   pasture and cropland in Alberta, suggest that some climate-mediated
   range expansion of grassland songbirds in Alberta is possible. For six
   of the eight species projected to experience expansions of suitable
   climate area in Alberta, this suitable climate partly overlaps the
   current distribution of suitable land cover. Additionally, for more than
   half of the species examined, most of the area of currently suitable
   climate was projected to remain suitable to the end of the century,
   highlighting the importance of Alberta for the long-term persistence of
   these species. Some northern prairie-endemic species exhibited
   substantial projected northward shifts of both the northern and southern
   edges of the area of suitable climate. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus
   bairdii) and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), both at-risk grassland
   specialists, are predicted to have limited climate stability within

Abstract = {{Annual counts of migrating raptors at fixed observation points are a
   widespread practice, and changes in numbers counted over time, adjusted
   for survey effort, are commonly used as indices of trends in population
   size. Unmodeled year-to-year variation in detectability may introduce
   bias, reduce precision of trend estimates, and reduce power to detect
   trends. We conducted dependent double-observer surveys at the annual
   fall raptor migration count at Lucky Peak, Idaho, in 2009 and 2010 and
   applied Huggins closed-capture removal models and information-theoretic
   model selection to determine the relative importance of factors
   affecting detectability. The most parsimonious model included effects of
   observer team identity, distance, species, and day of the season. We
   then simulated 30 years of counts with heterogeneous individual
   detectability, a population decline (lambda = 0.964), and unexplained
   random variation in the number of available birds. Imperfect
   detectability did not bias trend estimation, and increased the time
   required to achieve 80\% power by less than 11\%. Results suggested that
   availability is a greater source of variance in annual counts than
   detectability; thus, efforts to account for availability would improve
   the monitoring value of migration counts. According to our models,
   long-term trends in observer efficiency or migratory flight distance may
   introduce substantial bias to trend estimates. Estimating detectability
   with a novel count protocol like our double-observer method is just one
   potential means of controlling such effects. The traditional approach of
   modeling the effects of covariates and adjusting the index may also be
   effective if ancillary data is collected consistently.}},

Abstract = {{Marsh birds are notoriously elusive, with variation in detection
   probability across species, regions, seasons, and different times of day
   and weather. Therefore, it is important to develop regional field survey
   protocols that maximize detections, but that also produce data for
   estimating and analytically adjusting for remaining differences in
   detections. We aimed to improve regional field survey protocols by
   estimating detection probability of eight elusive marsh bird species
   throughout two regions that have ongoing marsh bird monitoring programs:
   the southern Canadian Prairies (Prairie region) and the southern portion
   of the Great Lakes basin and parts of southern Quebec (Great Lakes-St.
   Lawrence region). We accomplished our goal using generalized binomial
   N-mixture models and data from similar to 22,300 marsh bird surveys
   conducted between 2008 and 2014 by Bird Studies Canada's Prairie, Great
   Lakes, and Quebec Marsh Monitoring Programs. Across all species, on
   average, detection probability was highest in the Great Lakes-St.
   Lawrence region from the beginning of May until mid-June, and then fell
   throughout the remainder of the season until the end of June; was lowest
   in the Prairie region in mid-May and then increased throughout the
   remainder of the season until the end of June; was highest during
   darkness compared with light; and did not vary significantly according
   to temperature (range: 0-30 degrees C), cloud cover (0\%-100\%), or wind
   (0-20 kph), or during morning versus evening. We used our results to
   formulate improved marsh bird survey protocols for each region. Our
   analysis and recommendations are useful and contribute to conservation
   of wetland birds at various scales from local single-species studies to
   the continental North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Program.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland birds are highly imperiled because of historical habitat loss
   and ongoing conversion of grasslands to agricultural and urban land
   uses. Therefore, prioritizing and further justifying conservation action
   in remaining grasslands is critical to protecting what remains.
   Grassland bird conservation has focused on identifying and protecting
   large grassland complexes referred to as Grassland Bird Conservation
   Areas (GBCAs). We identified and classified GBCAs in a region highly
   impacted by both agricultural and urban land conversion using previously
   developed methods. Then, we extended the analysis to include estimated
   relative abundance of five grassland focal species in each GBCA. Models
   of relative abundance were built using eight years of monitoring data
   collected by citizen scientists. Finally, we quantified the value of
   ecosystem services provided by each GBCA. There were nearly 55,000 ha of
   grassland habitats in the Chicago Metropolitan Region that met GBCA
   criteria, 33\% (18,415 ha) of which were protected. Proportion of
   abundance in protected versus unprotected areas was similar for Bobolink
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus; 46\%), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus
   savannarum; 52\%), and Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis; 48\%),
   whereas, Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii; 75\%) had a higher
   proportion of relative abundance in protected GBCAs and Eastern
   Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) had lower proportions (37\%). GBCAs
   provisioned just under \$900 million annually in ecosystem services,
   73\% of which is because of flood control. Outputs of this comprehensive
   approach will inform grassland bird conservation by providing detailed
   information about the value for birds and people of grassland habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how birds cope with climate change has received much
   attention in recent years. So far, more emphasis has been given to
   passerine species than to any other groups of birds, possibly because of
   the availability of long-term data sets. Our objective was to study the
   effect of climate change on spring arrival date and breeding chronology
   of Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis), a short-distance migrant with
   a diverse diet. Based on Etudes des Populations d'Oiseaux du Quebec
   (EPOQ) checklists, we found that gulls arrived in southern Quebec five
   days earlier in 2012 than in 1971. Sporadic observations in three nearby
   colonies indicated that Ring-billed gulls laid eggs eight days earlier
   in 2012 than they did in 1978. Both arrival and laying dates closely fit
   temperature warming. Because of their diverse diet, Ring-billed Gulls
   always have access to some food resources during the breeding period
   making a mismatch between phenology and food abundance unlikely.
   Continuous warming may enhance the use of agricultural lands by gulls
   before and during the breeding period. However, this may not be
   sufficient to compensate for a reduction of refuse accessibility at
   landfills that have implemented deterrence programs.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of haemosporidians in a Neotropical endemic bird area}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Haemosporidians are vector-transmitted intracellular parasites that
   occur in many bird species worldwide and may have important implications
   for wild bird populations. Surveys of haemosporidians have traditionally
   focused on Europe and North America, and only recently have they been
   carried out in the Neotropics, where the prevalence and impacts of the
   disease have been less studied and are not well understood. In this
   study we carried out a survey in the endemic bird area of the Sierra
   Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), an isolated coastal massif in northern
   Colombia that contains a large number of biomes and that is experiencing
   high rates of habitat loss. We sampled birds from 25 species at 2
   different altitudes (1640 and 2100 m asl) and determined avian
   haemosporidian infection by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing a
   portion of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene of the parasite. From the
   sampled birds, 32.1\% were infected by at least 1 of 12 unique cyt b
   lineages of haemosporidian genera: Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon,
   Haemoproteus, and subgenus Parahaemoproteus. We found a higher
   prevalence of avian haemosporidians at low altitudes (1640 m asl). All
   endemic bird species we sampled had at least one individual infected
   with avian haemosporidians. We also found evidence of higher overall
   prevalence among endemic rather than nonendemic birds, suggesting higher
   susceptibility in endemic birds. Overall, our findings suggest a high
   haemosporidian species richness in the bird community of the SNSM.
   Considering the rate of habitat loss that this area is experiencing, it
   is important to understand how avian haemosporidians affect bird
   populations; furthermore, more exhaustive sampling is required to fully
   comprehend the extent of avian haemosporidian infection in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Population declines of many wildlife species have been linked to habitat
   loss incurred through land-use change. Incorporation of conservation
   planning into development planning may mitigate these impacts. The
   threatened Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is
   experiencing loss of native habitat and high levels of energy
   development across its multijurisdictional range. Our goal was to
   explore relationships of the species occurrence with landscape
   characteristics and anthropogenic effects influencing its distribution
   through evaluation of habitat suitability associated with one particular
   habitat usage, lekking. Lekking has been relatively well-surveyed,
   though not consistently, in all jurisdictions. All five states in which
   Lesser Prairie-Chickens occur cooperated in development of a Maxent
   habitat suitability model. We created two models, one with state as a
   factor and one without state. When state was included it was the most
   important predictor, followed by percent of land cover consisting of
   known or suspected used vegetation classes within a 5000 m area around a
   lek. Without state, land cover was the most important predictor of
   relative habitat suitability for leks. Among the anthropogenic
   predictors, landscape condition, a measure of human impact integrated
   across several factors, was most important, ranking third in importance
   without state. These results quantify the relative suitability of the
   landscape within the current occupied range of Lesser Prairie-Chickens.
   These models, combined with other landscape information, form the basis
   of a habitat assessment tool that can be used to guide siting of
   development projects and targeting of areas for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Birds frequently interact with people when they occur in coupled
   human-ecological or anthropogenic environments, which makes the
   protection of legally protected species a challenge. Flight initiation
   distances (FIDs) are often used to inform development of appropriate
   buffer distances required for human exclusion zones used to protect
   birds nesting in anthropogenic landscapes. Piping Plovers (Charadrius
   melodus) are protected by the Endangered Species Act in the United
   States and often nest in areas used by humans. Studies evaluating Piping
   Plover FIDs are limited and implementation of exclusion zones has been
   inconsistent across the species' range. We measured Piping Plover
   response and FIDs to naturally occurring stimuli on public beaches at
   Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, USA. Piping Plover FIDs differed most by
   stimulus class (vehicle, human, dog, human with dog), Julian day, and
   hour of day. Piping Plover FIDs were greatest for dog and human with dog
   compared to humans and vehicles. For all types of stimuli, Piping Plover
   FIDs decreased over time during the nesting season and increased
   slightly during each day. In the majority of instances in which Piping
   Plovers left their nests, return times to the nest were relatively short
   (less than three minutes). These results suggest Piping Plovers become
   habituated to the presence of human-related stimuli over the course of a
   nesting season, but other explanations such as parental investment and
   risk allocation cannot be excluded. Additional research and improved
   guidance regarding the implementation of exclusion zones is needed so
   managers can implement effective protection programs in anthropogenic
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Both habitat changes and predation can cause population declines in
   farmland birds. Habitat changes may allow novel or invasive alien
   predators to establish populations in new environments, which can have
   major ecological consequences for native prey species. We studied
   effects of a novel avian predator, the Montagu's Harrier (Circus
   pygargus), on the survival of male Black-headed Buntings (Emberiza
   melanocephala). Between 2011 and 2015, survival of 35 territorial
   Black-headed Bunting males was monitored and their apparent survival in
   years with and without predators was computed. The apparent monthly
   survival (reported +/- SE) was very high during the breeding seasons
   when Montagu's Harrier was not present (0.957 +/- 0.035) as well as in
   nonbreeding periods (0.981 +/- 0.011). It was significantly lower during
   the breeding season of 2013 when Montagu's Harrier was present in the
   area (0.600 +/- 0.136). Changes in habitat structure due to alteration
   in agricultural practice and temporal changes in weather conditions have
   presumably enabled Montagu's Harriers to breed in the study area and led
   to increases in the importance of birds in Montagu's Harrier's diet. The
   appearance of Montagu's Harriers in the study area strongly coincided
   with the steep decrease in the apparent survival of the male
   Black-headed Buntings. The lack of appropriate response in male
   Black-headed Buntings made them extremely vulnerable to attacks of this
   aerial predator.}},

Abstract = {{Every year a large number of birds die when they collide with windows.
   The actual number is difficult to ascertain. Previous attempts to
   estimate bird-window collision rates in Canada relied heavily on a prior
   citizen-science study that used memory-based surveys. Such an approach
   to data collection has many potential biases. We built upon this study
   and its recommendations for future research by creating a
   citizen-science program that actively searched for collision evidence at
   houses and apartments for an extended period with the objective to see
   how standardized approaches to data collection compared with memory
   recall. Absolute collision estimates as well as relative differences
   were compared between residence types in the two studies, and we found
   considerable differences in absolute values for collisions but similar
   rankings of collision rates between residence types. Collision recall
   rates in our study (56.5\%) were very similar those in the prior 2012
   study, where 50.5\% of participants remembered a bird colliding with a
   window at some time in the past. Fatality estimates, however, were 1.4
   times higher in the 2012 study than in our study based on standardized
   searches. Rural houses with a bird feeder consistently had the highest
   number of collisions. This suggests that memory recall surveys may be a
   useful tool for understanding the relative importance of different risk
   factors causing bird-window collisions.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is an open-country species breeding
   in the northern United States and Canada, and has likely experienced a
   long-term, range-wide, and substantial decline. However, the cause and
   magnitude of the decline is not well understood. We set forth to address
   the first two of six previously proposed conservation priorities to be
   addressed for this species: (1) better define habitat use and (2)
   improve population monitoring. We recruited 131 volunteers to survey
   over 6.2 million ha within the state of Idaho for Short-eared Owls
   during the 2015 breeding season. We surveyed 75 transects, 71 of which
   were surveyed twice, and detected Short-eared Owls on 27 transects. We
   performed multiscale occupancy modeling to identify habitat
   associations, and performed multiscale abundance modeling to generate a
   state-wide population estimate. Our results suggest that within the
   state of Idaho, Short-eared Owls are more often found in areas with
   marshland or riparian habitat or areas with greater amounts of sagebrush
   habitat at the 1750 ha transect scale. At the 50 ha point scale,
   Short-eared Owls tend to associate positively with fallow and bare dirt
   agricultural land and negatively with grassland. Cropland was not chosen
   at the broader transect scale suggesting that Short-eared Owls may
   prefer more heterogeneous landscapes. On the surface our results may
   seem contradictory to the presumed land use by a ``grassland{''}
   species; however, the grasslands of the Intermountain West, consisting
   largely of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), lack the complex
   structure shown to be preferred by these owls. We suggest the local
   adaptation to agriculture represents the next best habitat to their
   historical native habitat preferences. Regardless, we have confirmed
   regional differences that should be considered in conservation planning
   for this species. Last, our results demonstrate the feasibility,
   efficiency, and effectiveness of utilizing public participation in
   scientific research to achieve a robust sampling methodology across the
   broad geography of the Intermountain West.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are often grazed by cattle and many grassland birds nest on
   the ground, potentially exposing nests to trampling. We tested for
   trampling risk introduced by cattle to nests of endangered Florida
   Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) using
   experimentally paired grids of artificial nests (i.e., clay targets)
   similar in size to nests of Florida Grasshopper Sparrows and counted the
   number of clay targets that were broken in paired grazed and ungrazed
   enclosures. Clay targets in grazed grids were trampled 3.9\% more often
   than their respective ungrazed grids, and measurements of cattle
   presence or density were correlated with the number of broken clay
   targets, suggesting that excluding cattle during breeding is an
   important management recommendation for the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow.
   Trampling rates within grazed enclosures were spatially homogeneous with
   respect to cattle infrastructure such as supplemental feeding troughs
   and fences, and forests and stocking density were poor predictors of
   trampling rates when excluding ungrazed grids. We used population
   viability analysis to compare quasi-extinction rates, intrinsic growth
   rates, and median abundance in grazed and ungrazed Florida Grasshopper
   Sparrow aggregations to further understand the biological significance
   of management aimed at reducing trampling rates during the breeding
   season. Simulations indicated that trampling from grazing increased
   quasi-extinction rates by 41\% while reducing intrinsic growth rates by
   0.048, and reducing median abundance by an average of 214 singing males
   after 50 years. Management should avoid grazing enclosures occupied by
   Florida Grasshopper Sparrows during the nesting season to minimize
   trampling rates. Our methods that combine trampling experiments with
   population viability analysis provide a framework for testing effects
   from trampling on other grassland ground-nesting birds, and can directly
   inform conservation and management of the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of abundance or density are essential for wildlife management
   and conservation. There are few effective density estimates for the
   Buff-throated Partridge Tetraophasis szechenyii, a rare and elusive
   high-mountain Galliform species endemic to western China. In this study,
   we used the temporary emigration N-mixture model to estimate density of
   this species, with data acquired from playback point count surveys
   around a sacred area based on indigenous Tibetan culture of protection
   of wildlife, in Yajiang County, Sichuan, China, during April-June 2009.
   Within 84 125-m radius points, we recorded 53 partridge groups during
   three repeats. The best model indicated that detection probability was
   described by covariates of vegetation cover type, week of visit, time of
   day, and weather with weak effects, and a partridge group was present
   during a sampling period with a constant probability. The abundance
   component was accounted for by vegetation association. Abundance was
   substantially higher in rhododendron shrubs, fir-larch forests, mixed
   spruce-larch-birch forests, and especially oak thickets than in pine
   forests. The model predicted a density of 5.14 groups/km(2), which is
   similar to an estimate of 4.7 - 5.3 groups/km(2) quantified via an
   intensive spot-mapping effort. The post-hoc estimate of individual
   density was 14.44 individuals/km(2), based on the estimated mean group
   size of 2.81. We suggest that the method we employed is applicable to
   estimate densities of Buff-throated Partridges in large areas. Given
   importance of a mosaic habitat for this species, local logging should be
   regulated. Despite no effect of the conservation area (sacred) on the
   abundance of Buff-throated Partridges, we suggest regulations linking
   the sacred mountain conservation area with the official conservation
   system because of strong local participation facilitated by sacred
   mountains in land conservation.}},

Title = {{Apparent survival of adult Leach's Storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa)
   breeding on Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Leach's Storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa; hereafter
   storm-petrel), one of the most widespread procellariiform seabirds in
   the world, appear to be declining in many parts of their breeding range.
   As part of a regional effort to assess status of storm-petrel colonies
   in eastern North America, we estimated apparent survival and recapture
   probabilities from 2009 to 2014 for adults on Bon Portage Island (43
   degrees 28' N, 65 degrees 44' W), located off the southwestern coast of
   Nova Scotia, Canada. Mean annual survival estimated for this colony was
   low (0.78 +/- 0.04) compared with other procellariiforms, e. g., > 0.90
   for many albatrosses and petrels. Storm-petrels that were fitted with
   very high frequency (VHF) radio tags had an average of 0.11 +/- 0.05
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.01 to 0.21) higher survival
   probabilities than those that were not, possibly because VHF tags were
   attached to known, established breeders. There was weak evidence that
   survival was reduced by an average of 0.07 +/- 0.04 for storm-petrels in
   study plots that were occupied by Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and
   their chicks; however, this result was not statistically significant
   (95\% CI: -0.15 to 0.02). Low adult survival is an early indication that
   this important colony may be under stress. However, further work is
   needed to determine if the colony is indeed declining and, if so, to
   determine the cause(s) of the decline so that they may be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Feeding wild birds creates an important link between homeowners and
   conservation. The effects of bird feeders and year-round feeding on
   birds have not been well studied, however, particularly in relationship
   to bird-window collisions. We determined effects of bird feeder presence
   and placement on bird-window collisions at residential homes. Paired
   month-long trials in which a feeder was either present or absent for one
   month and then removed or added for the second month were completed at
   55 windows at 43 houses. In each trial, homeowners were asked to search
   their study window daily for evidence of a bird-window collision. During
   the study there were 51 collisions when there was no bird feeder and 94
   when the feeder was present. The season when each trial was set up was
   the best individual predictor of bird-window collisions. The largest
   number of collisions was observed during fall migration and the lowest
   during the winter months. There were no collisions at 26 of the study
   windows. High variance was observed in the number of collisions at
   different houses, indicating that effects of bird feeders are context
   dependent. Changing the occurrence, timing, and placement of feeders can
   alter collision rates but is only one of many factors that influence
   whether a residential house is likely to have a bird window-collision or
   not.}},

Title = {{Effects of Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat treatment efforts on associated
   avifauna and vegetation structure}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Conservation efforts over the last 20 years for the Gunnison Sage-Grouse
   (Centrocercus minimus) have involved extensive habitat manipulations
   done predominantly to improve brood rearing habitat for the grouse.
   However, the effects of Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat treatments on
   sympatric avifauna and responses of vegetation to manipulations are
   rarely measured, and if they are, it is immediately following treatment
   implementation. This study examined the concept of umbrella species
   management by retrospectively comparing density and occupancy of eight
   sagebrush associated songbird species and six measures of vegetation in
   treated and control sites. Our results suggested that songbird densities
   and occupancy changed for birds at the extreme ends of their association
   with sagebrush and varied with fine-scale habitat structure. We found
   Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri) decreased in density on treated
   sites and Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased. Occupancy
   estimation revealed that Brewer's Sparrows and Green-tailed Towhees
   (Pipilo chlorurus) occupied significantly fewer treated points whereas
   Vesper Sparrows occupied significantly more. Vegetation comparisons
   between treated and control areas found shrub cover to be 26\% lower in
   treated sites. Lower shrub cover in treated areas may explain the
   differences in occupancy and densities of the species sampled based on
   known habitat needs. The fine-scale analysis showed a negative
   relationship to forb height and cover for the Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza
   belli) indicating, from vegetation measures showing grass and forb cover
   during a good precipitation year covered significantly more area in the
   treatment than the control sites, that Sage Sparrows may also not
   respond favorably to Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat treatments. While the
   concept of an umbrella species is appealing, evidence from this study
   suggests that conservation efforts aimed at the Gunnison Sage-Grouse may
   not be particularly effective for conserving other sagebrush obligate
   species of concern. This is probably due to Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat
   management being focused on the improvement of brood rearing habitat
   which reduces sagebrush cover and promotes development of understory
   forbs and grasses.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Skewed sex ratios can have negative implications for population growth
   if they do not match a species' life history. A skewed tertiary sex
   ratio has been detected in a population of Mountain Plover (Charadrius
   montanus), a grassland shorebird experiencing population declines. To
   study the cause of the observed male skew, we examined three early life
   stages between egg and fledgling in eastern Colorado from 2010 to 2012.
   This allows us to distinguish between egg production and chick survival
   as an explanation for the observed skew. We examined the primary sex
   ratio in eggs produced and the secondary sex ratio in hatched chicks to
   see if the sex ratio bias occurs before hatching. We also determined the
   sex ratio at fledging to reveal sex-specific mortality of nestlings. The
   primary sex ratio was 1.01 (+/- 0.01) males per female. The secondary
   sex ratio consisted of 1.10 (+/- 0.02) males per female. The probability
   of a chick surviving to fledging differed between males (0.55 +/- 0.13)
   and females (0.47 +/- 0.15), but the precision of these survival
   estimates was low. Sex ratios in early life stages of the Mountain
   Plover do not explain the skewed sex ratio observed in adults in this
   breeding population.}},

Abstract = {{Avian communities in cloud forests have high levels of endemism and are
   at major risk given the accelerated rate of habitat fragmentation.
   Nevertheless, the response of these communities to changes in fragment
   size remains poorly understood. We evaluated species richness, bird
   community density, community composition, and dominance as indicators of
   the response to fragment size in a fragmented cloud forest landscape in
   central Veracruz, Mexico. Medium-sized fragments had statistically
   higher than expected species richness and more even communities, which
   may be a reflection of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which
   medium-sized fragments are exploited by both forest and
   disturbance-associated species. Bird density also reached higher values
   in medium-sized fragments, which may indicate a carrying capacity in
   this habitat. However, large cloud forest fragments had a distinct
   taxonomic and functional composition, attributable to an increased
   number of understory insectivore species and canopy frugivores. By
   comparison, omnivorous species associated with human-altered habitats
   were more abundant in smaller fragments. Hence, although medium-sized
   cloud forest fragments had higher species richness and high bird
   density, large forest tracts maintained a distinct avian community
   composition, particularly of insectivorous and frugivorous species.
   Furthermore, the underlying response to fragmentation can only be
   properly addressed when contrasting several community attributes, such
   as richness, density, composition, and species dominance. Therefore,
   cloud forest conservation should aim to preserve the remaining large
   forest fragments to maintain comprehensive avian communities and avoid
   local extinctions.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is the principal source of
   data to inform researchers about the status of and trend for boreal
   forest birds. Unfortunately, little BBS coverage is available in the
   boreal forest, where increasing concern over the status of species
   breeding there has increased interest in northward expansion of the BBS.
   However, high disturbance rates in the boreal forest may complicate
   roadside monitoring. If the roadside sampling frame does not capture
   variation in disturbance rates because of either road placement or the
   use of roads for resource extraction, biased trend estimates might
   result. In this study, we examined roadside bias in the proportional
   representation of habitat disturbance via spatial data on forest
   ``loss,{''} forest fires, and anthropogenic disturbance. In each of 455
   BBS routes, the area disturbed within multiple buffers away from the
   road was calculated and compared against the area disturbed in degree
   blocks and BBS strata. We found a nonlinear relationship between bias
   and distance from the road, suggesting forest loss and forest fires were
   underrepresented below 75 and 100 m, respectively. In contrast,
   anthropogenic disturbance was overrepresented at distances below 500 m
   and underrepresented thereafter. After accounting for distance from
   road, BBS routes were reasonably representative of the degree blocks
   they were within, with only a few strata showing biased representation.
   In general, anthropogenic disturbance is overrepresented in southern
   strata, and forest fires are underrepresented in almost all strata.
   Similar biases exist when comparing the entire road network and the
   subset sampled by BBS routes against the amount of disturbance within
   BBS strata; however, the magnitude of biases differed. Based on our
   results, we recommend that spatial stratification and rotating panel
   designs be used to spread limited BBS and off-road sampling effort in an
   unbiased fashion and that new BBS routes be established where sufficient
   road coverage exists.}},

Abstract = {{Once abundant, the Newfoundland Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus
   minimus) has declined by as much as 95\% since 1975. Underlying cause(s)
   of this population collapse are not known, although hypotheses include
   loss of winter habitat and the introduction of red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to Newfoundland. Uncertainties regarding
   habitat needs are also extensive, and these knowledge gaps are an
   impediment to conservation. We investigated neighborhood (i.e., within
   115 m {[}4.1 ha]) and landscape scale (i.e., within 1250 m {[}490.8 ha])
   habitat associations of Gray-cheeked Thrush in a 200-km(2) study area in
   the Long Range Mountains of western Newfoundland, where elevations range
   from 300-600 m and landcover was a matrix of old growth fir forest, 6-to
   8-year-old clearcuts, coniferous scrub, bogs, and barrens. Thrushes were
   restricted to elevations above similar to 375 m, and occurrence was
   strongly positively related to elevation. Occurrence was also positively
   related to cover of tall scrub forest at the neighborhood scale, and at
   the landscape scale showed curvilinear relations with the proportion of
   both tall scrub and old growth forest that peaked with intermediate
   amounts of cover. Occurrence of thrushes was also highest when clearcuts
   made up 60\%-70\% of neighborhood landcover, but was negatively related
   to cover of clearcuts in the broader landscape. Finally, occurrence was
   highest in areas having 50\% cover of partially harvested forest (strip
   cuts or row cuts) at the neighborhood scale, but because this treatment
   was limited to one small portion of the study area, this finding may be
   spurious. Taken together, our results suggest selection for mixed
   habitats and sensitivity to both neighborhood and landscape-scale
   habitat. More research is needed on responses of thrushes to forestry,
   including use of older clearcuts, partially harvested stands, and
   precommercially thinned clearcuts. Finally, restriction of thrushes to
   higher elevations is consistent with the hypothesis that they have been
   impacted by squirrels, because squirrels were rare or absent at these
   elevations.}},

Abstract = {{Among shrubland-and young forest-nesting bird species in North America,
   Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) are one of the most
   rapidly declining partly because of limited nesting habitat. Creation
   and management of high quality vegetation communities used for nesting
   are needed to reduce declines. Thus, we examined whether common
   characteristics could be managed across much of the Golden-winged
   Warbler's breeding range to increase daily survival rate (DSR) of nests.
   We monitored 388 nests on 62 sites throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin, New
   York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. We
   evaluated competing DSR models in spatial-temporal (dominant vegetation
   type, population segment, state, and year), intraseasonal (nest stage
   and time-within-season), and vegetation model suites. The best-supported
   DSR models among the three model suites suggested potential associations
   between daily survival rate of nests and state, time-within-season,
   percent grass and Rubus cover within 1 m of the nest, and distance to
   later successional forest edge. Overall, grass cover (negative
   association with DSR above 50\%) and Rubus cover (DSR lowest at about
   30\%) within 1 m of the nest and distance to later successional forest
   edge (negative association with DSR) may represent common management
   targets across our states for increasing Golden-winged Warbler DSR,
   particularly in the Appalachian Mountains population segment.
   Context-specific adjustments to management strategies, such as in
   wetlands or areas of overlap with Blue-winged Warblers (Vermivora
   cyanoptera), may be necessary to increase DSR for Golden-winged
   Warblers.}},

Title = {{Stand and within-stand factors influencing Golden-winged Warbler use of
   regenerating stands in the central Appalachian Mountains}},

Abstract = {{The Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is currently being
   considered for protected status under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
   The creation of breeding habitat in the Appalachian Mountains is
   considered a conservation priority for this songbird, which is dependent
   on extensively forested landscapes with adequate availability of young
   forest. We modeled abundance of Golden-winged Warbler males in
   regenerating harvested forest stands that were 0-17 years postharvest at
   both mid-Appalachian and northeast Pennsylvania regional scales using
   stand and within-stand characteristics of 222 regenerating stands,
   2010-2011. Variables that were most influential at the mid-Appalachian
   scale were different than those in the northeast region. Across the
   mid-Appalachian ecoregion, the proportion of young forest cover, i.e.,
   shrub/scrub cover, within 1 km of regenerating stands best explained
   abundance of Golden-winged Warblers. Golden-winged Warbler response was
   best explained by a concave quadratic relationship in which abundance
   was highest with 5-15\% land in young forest cover. We also found
   evidence that the amount of herbaceous cover, i.e., the amount of
   grasses and forbs, within a regenerating stand positively influenced
   abundance of Golden-winged Warblers. In northeastern Pennsylvania, where
   young forest cover is found in high proportions, the distance to the
   nearest regenerating stand best explained variation in abundance of
   Golden-winged Warblers. Abundance of Golden-winged Warblers was < 1 male
   per survey when another regenerating stand was > 1500 m away. When
   modeling within-stand features in the northeast region, many of the
   models were closely ranked, indicating that multiple variables likely
   explained Golden-winged Warbler response to within-stand conditions.
   Based on our findings, we have proposed several management guidelines
   for land managers interested in creating breeding habitat for
   Golden-winged Warblers using commercial timber operations. For example,
   we recommend when managing for Golden-winged Warblers in the central
   Appalachian Mountains that managers should strive for 15\% young forest
   in a heavily forested landscape (> 70\% forest cover) and cluster stands
   within 1-2 km of other young forest habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effect of habitat fragmentation is a fundamental yet
   complicated aim of many ecological studies. Beni savanna is a naturally
   fragmented forest habitat, where forest islands exhibit variation in
   resources and threats. To understand how the availability of resources
   and threats affect the use of forest islands by parrots, we applied
   occupancy modeling to quantify use and detection probabilities for 12
   parrot species on 60 forest islands. The presence of urucuri (Attalea
   phalerata) and macaw (Acrocomia aculeata) palms, the number of tree
   cavities on the islands, and the presence of selective logging, and fire
   were included as covariates associated with availability of resources
   and threats. The model-selection analysis indicated that both resources
   and threats variables explained the use of forest islands by parrots.
   For most species, the best models confirmed predictions. The number of
   cavities was positively associated with use of forest islands by 11
   species. The area of the island and the presence of macaw palm showed a
   positive association with the probability of use by seven and five
   species, respectively, while selective logging and fire showed a
   negative association with five and six species, respectively. The
   Blue-throated Macaw (Ara glaucogularis), the critically endangered
   parrot species endemic to our study area, was the only species that
   showed a negative association with both threats. Monitoring continues to
   be essential to evaluate conservation and management actions of parrot
   populations. Understanding of how species are using this natural
   fragmented habitat will help determine which fragments should be
   preserved and which conservation actions are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in coastal storm frequency and intensity expected under
   most climate change scenarios is likely to substantially modify beach
   configuration and associated habitats. This study aimed to analyze the
   impact of coastal storms on a nesting population of the endangered
   Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus melodus) in southeastern New
   Brunswick, Canada. Previous studies have shown that numbers of nesting
   Piping Plovers may increase following storms that create new nesting
   habitat at individual beaches. However, to our knowledge, no test of
   this pattern has been conducted over a regional scale. We hypothesized
   that Piping Plover abundance would increase after large coastal storms
   occurring during the nonbreeding season. However, we expected a delay in
   the colonization of newly created habitat owing to low-density
   populations, combined with high site fidelity of adults and high
   variability in survival rate of subadults. We tested this hypothesis
   using a 27-year (1986-2012) data set of Piping Plover abundance and
   productivity (nesting pairs and fledged young) collected at five sites
   in eastern New Brunswick. We identified 11 major storms that could
   potentially have modified Piping Plover habitat over the study period.
   The number of fledged young increased three years after a major storm,
   but the relationship was much weaker for the number of nesting pairs.
   These findings are consistent with the hypothesized increase in suitable
   habitat after coastal storms. Including storm occurrence with other
   factors influencing habitat quality will enhance Piping Plover
   conservation strategies.}},

Title = {{Density dependence and phenological mismatch: consequences for growth

Abstract = {{The extent to which species are plastic in the timing of their
   reproductive events relative to phenology suggests how climate change
   might affect their demography. An ecological mismatch between the timing
   of hatch for avian species and the peak availability in quality and
   quantity of forage for rapidly growing offspring might ultimately affect
   recruitment to the breeding population unless individuals can adjust the
   timing of breeding to adapt to changing phenology. We evaluated effects
   of goose density, hatch timing relative to forage plant phenology, and
   weather indices on annual growth of pre-fledging Canada geese (Branta
   canadensis) from 1993-2010 at Akimiski Island, Nunavut. We found effects
   of both density and hatch timing relative to forage plant phenology; the
   earlier that eggs hatched relative to forage plant phenology, the larger
   the mean gosling size near fledging. Goslings were smallest in years
   when hatch was latest relative to forage plant phenology, and when local
   abundance of breeding adults was highest. We found no evidence for a
   trend in relative hatch timing, but it was apparent that in early
   springs, Canada geese tended to hatch later relative to vegetation
   phenology, suggesting that geese were not always able to adjust the
   timing of nesting as rapidly as vegetation phenology was advanced.
   Analyses using forage biomass information revealed a positive
   relationship between gosling size and per capita biomass availability,
   suggesting a causal mechanism for the density effect. The effects of
   weather parameters explained additional variation in mean annual gosling
   size, although total June and July rainfall had a small additive effect
   on gosling size. Modelling of annual first-year survival probability
   using mean annual gosling size as an annual covariate revealed a
   positive relationship, suggesting that reduced gosling growth negatively
   impacts recruitment.}},

Title = {{Trends and tactics of mouse predation on Tristan Albatross Diomedea
   dabbenena chicks at Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The critically endangered Tristan Albatross Diomedea dabbenena breeds
   almost exclusively on Gough Island, in the central South Atlantic, where
   breeding success is much lower than other great albatrosses (Diomedea
   spp.) worldwide. Most breeding failures occur during the chick-rearing
   stage, when other great albatrosses suffer few failures. This unusual
   pattern of breeding failure is assumed to be largely due to predation by
   introduced house mice Mus musculus, but there have been few direct
   observations of mouse attacks. We closely monitored the fates of 20
   chicks in the Gonydale study colony (123 chicks in 2014) using
   motion-activated cameras to determine the causes of chick mortality.
   Only 5 of 20 chicks survived to fledge, and of the 15 failures, 14
   (93\%) were due to mouse predation. One mouse-wounded chick was killed
   by a Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus; the rest died outright
   from their wounds within 3.9 +/- 1.2 days of the first attack. Despite
   this high impact, most chicks were attacked by only 1-2 mice at once
   (maximum 9). The remaining 103 chicks in the study colony were checked
   less frequently, but the timing of failures was broadly similar to the
   20 closely monitored nests, and the presence of mouse wounds on other
   chicks strongly suggests that mice were responsible for most chick
   deaths. Breeding success in the Gonydale study colony averages 28\% from
   2001 to 2014; far lower than the normal range of breeding success of
   Diomedea species occurring on islands free from introduced predators.
   Island-wide breeding success fell below 10\% for the first time in 2014,
   making it even more urgent to eradicate mice from Gough Island.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN) consists of
   standardized observation and migration count stations located largely
   along Canada's southern border. A major purpose of CMMN is to detect
   population trends of migratory passerines that breed primarily in the
   boreal forest and are otherwise poorly monitored by the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). A primary limitation of this approach to
   monitoring is that it is currently not clear which geographic regions of
   the boreal forest are represented by the trends generated for each bird
   species at each station or group of stations. Such information on ``
   catchment areas{''} for CMMN will greatly enhance their value in
   contributing to understanding causes of population trends, as well as
   facilitating joint trend analysis for stations with similar catchments.
   It is now well established that naturally occurring concentrations of
   deuterium in feathers grown in North America can provide information on
   their approximate geographic origins, especially latitude. We used
   stable hydrogen isotope analyses of feathers (delta H-2(f)) from 15
   species intercepted at 22 CMMN stations to assign approximate origins to
   populations moving through stations or groups of stations. We further
   constrained the potential catchment areas using prior information on
   potential longitudinal origins based upon bird migration trajectories
   predicted from band recovery data and known breeding distributions. We
   detected several cases of differences in catchment area of species
   passing through sites, and between seasons within species. We discuss
   the importance of our findings, and future directions for using this
   approach to assist conservation of migratory birds at continental
   scales.}},

   studies from across North America have recorded a surplus of nonbreeding
   adult Bald Eagles in dense populations when optimal habitat and food
   become limited. Placentia Bay, Newfoundland is one of these. The area
   has one of the highest densities of Bald Eagles in eastern North
   America, and has recently experienced an increase in the proportion of
   nonbreeding adults within the population. We tested whether the observed
   Bald Eagle population trends in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland during the
   breeding seasons 1990-2009 are due to habitat saturation. We found no
   significant differences in habitat or food resource characteristics
   between occupied territories and pseudo-absence data or between nest
   sites with high vs. low nest activity/occupancy rates. Therefore there
   is no evidence for habitat saturation for Bald Eagles in Placentia Bay
   and alternative hypotheses for the high proportion of nonbreeding adults
   should be considered. The Newfoundland population provides an
   interesting case for examination because it did not historically appear
   to be affected by pollution. An understanding of Bald Eagle population
   dynamics in a relatively pristine area with a high density can be
   informative for restoration and conservation of Bald Eagle populations
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian and U.S. federal wildlife agencies completed four decadal
   surveys, spanning the years 1977 to 2009, to census colonial waterbirds
   breeding on the Great Lakes and adjoining bodies of water. In this
   paper, we reports abundance, distribution, and general population trends
   of three species: Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax),
   Great Egret (Ardea alba), and Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias).
   Estimates of nest numbers ranged from approximately 4000-6100 for the
   Black-crowned Night-Heron, 250-1900 for the Great Egret, and 3800-6400
   for the Great Blue Heron. Average annual rates of change in nest numbers
   between the first (1977) and fourth (2008) census were 1\% for the
   Black-crowned Night-Heron, +23\% for the Great Egret, and 0.27\% for the
   Great Blue Heron. Across the 30-year census, Black-crowned Night-Heron
   estimates decreased in U.S. (-57\%) but increased (+18\%) in Canadian
   waters, Great Egret nests increased 1381\% in Canadian waters with a
   smaller, but still substantial increase in the number of nests at U.S.
   colonies (+613\%), and Great Blue Heron numbers increased 148\% in
   Canadian waters and 713\% in U.S. waters. Although a single factor
   cannot be clearly linked to changes observed in each species'
   distribution, hydrological variation, habitat succession, nest
   competition with Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and
   land use changes likely all contributed. Management activities should
   support both breeding and foraging conditions including restoration of
   early successional habitats and anticipate continued northward
   expansions in the distributions of these waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of ecological thresholds are now being widely used to develop
   conservation targets: breakpoint-based thresholds represent tipping
   points where system properties change dramatically, whereas
   classification thresholds identify groups of data points with
   contrasting properties. Both breakpoint-based and classification
   thresholds are useful tools in evidence-based conservation. However, it
   is critical that the type of threshold to be estimated corresponds with
   the question of interest and that appropriate statistical procedures are
   used to determine its location. On the basis of their statistical
   properties, we recommend using piecewise regression methods to identify
   breakpoint-based thresholds and discriminant analysis or classification

Abstract = {{Urbanization changes habitat in a multitude of ways, including altering
   food availability. Access to human-provided food can change the
   relationship between body condition and honest advertisements of
   fitness, which may result in changes to behavior, demography, and
   metapopulation dynamics. We compared plumage color, its relationship
   with body condition and feather growth, and use as signal of dominance
   between a suburban and a wildland population of Florida Scrub-Jay
   (Aphelocoma coerulescens). Although plumage color was not related to
   body condition at either site, suburban birds had plumage with a greater
   proportion of total reflectance in the ultra-violet (UV) and peak
   reflectance at shorter wavelengths. Despite the use of plumage
   reflectance as a signal of dominance among individuals in the wildlands,
   we found no evidence of status signaling at the suburban site. However,
   birds emigrating from the suburban site to the wildland site tended to
   be more successful at acquiring breeder status but less successful at
   reproducing than were immigrants from an adjacent wildland site,
   suggesting that signaled and realized quality differ. These differences
   in signaling content among populations could have demographic effects at
   metapopulation scales and may represent an evolutionary trap whereby
   suburban immigrants are preferred as mates even though their
   reproductive success relative to effort is lower.}},

Title = {{Models to predict the distribution and abundance of breeding ducks in
   Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Detailed knowledge of waterfowl abundance and distribution across Canada
   is lacking, which limits our ability to effectively conserve and manage
   their populations. We used 15 years of data from an aerial transect
   survey to model the abundance of 17 species or species groups of ducks
   within southern and boreal Canada. We included 78 climatic,
   hydrological, and landscape variables in Boosted Regression Tree models,
   allowing flexible response curves and multiway interactions among
   variables. We assessed predictive performance of the models using four
   metrics and calculated uncertainty as the coefficient of variation of
   predictions across 20 replicate models. Maps of predicted relative
   abundance were generated from resulting models, and they largely match
   spatial patterns evident in the transect data. We observed two main
   distribution patterns: a concentrated prairie-parkland distribution and
   a more dispersed pan-Canadian distribution. These patterns were
   congruent with the relative importance of predictor variables and model
   evaluation statistics among the two groups of distributions. Most
   species had a hydrological variable as the most important predictor,
   although the specific hydrological variable differed somewhat among
   species. In some cases, important variables had clear ecological
   interpretations, but in some instances, e. g., topographic roughness,
   they may simply reflect chance correlations between species
   distributions and environmental variables identified by the
   model-building process. Given the performance of our models, we suggest
   that the resulting prediction maps can be used in future research and to
   guide conservation activities, particularly within the bounds of the
   survey area.}},

Abstract = {{Population models are essential components of large-scale conservation
   and management plans for the federally endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler
   (Setophaga chrysoparia; hereafter GCWA). However, existing models are
   based on vital rate estimates calculated using relatively small data
   sets that are now more than a decade old. We estimated more current,
   precise adult and juvenile apparent survival (Phi) probabilities and
   their associated variances for male GCWAs. In addition to providing
   estimates for use in population modeling, we tested hypotheses about
   spatial and temporal variation in Phi. We assessed whether a linear
   trend in Phi or a change in the overall mean Phi corresponded to an
   observed increase in GCWA abundance during 1992-2000 and if Phi varied
   among study plots. To accomplish these objectives, we analyzed long-term
   GCWA capture-resight data from 1992 through 2011, collected across seven
   study plots on the Fort Hood Military Reservation using a
   Cormack-Jolly-Seber model structure within program MARK. We also
   estimated Phi process and sampling variances using a variance-components
   approach. Our results did not provide evidence of site-specific
   variation in adult Phi on the installation. Because of a lack of data,
   we could not assess whether juvenile Phi varied spatially. We did not
   detect a strong temporal association between GCWA abundance and alpha.
   Mean estimates of Phi for adult and juvenile male GCWAs for all years
   analyzed were 0.47 with a process variance of 0.0120 and a sampling
   variance of 0.0113 and 0.28 with a process variance of 0.0076 and a
   sampling variance of 0.0149, respectively. Although juvenile Phi did not
   differ greatly from previous estimates, our adult Phi estimate suggests
   previous GCWA population models were overly optimistic with respect to
   adult survival. These updated F probabilities and their associated
   variances will be incorporated into new population models to assist with
   GCWA conservation decision making.}},

   Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA.}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat
   specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest
   throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known
   about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas,
   especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count
   and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011
   -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green
   forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since
   1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high
   severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used
   occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found
   positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects,
   number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest,
   and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green
   forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site
   colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05
   and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals
   detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the
   landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively
   stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole
   pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these
   elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next
   century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers
   significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in
   efforts to conserve this rare species.}},

Abstract = {{The distance covered by foraging animals, especially those that radiate
   from a central area when foraging, may affect ecosystem, community, and
   population dynamics, and has conservation and landscape planning
   implications for multiple taxa, including migratory waterfowl. Migrating
   and wintering waterfowl make regular foraging flights between roosting
   and feeding areas that can greatly impact energetic resources within the
   foraging zone near roost sites. We reviewed published studies and gray
   literature for oneway foraging flight distances (FFDs) of migrating and
   wintering dabbling ducks and geese. Thirty reviewed studies reported
   FFDs and several reported values for multiple species or locations. We
   obtained FFD values for migration (n = 7) and winter (n = 70). We
   evaluated the effects of body mass, guild, i.e., dabbling duck or goose,
   and location, i.e., Nearctic or Palearctic, on FFDs. We used the
   second-order Akaike's Information Criterion for model selection. We
   found support for effects of location and guild on FFDs. FFDs of
   waterfowl wintering in the Nearctic (7.4 +/- 6.7 km, mean +/- SD; n = 39
   values) were longer than in the Palearctic (4.2 +/- 3.2 km; n = 31
   values). The FFDs of geese (7.8 +/- 7.2 km, mean +/- SD; n = 24 values)
   were longer than FFDs of dabbling ducks (5.1 +/- 4.4 km, mean +/- SD; n
   = 46 values). We found mixed evidence that distance flown from the roost
   changed, i.e., increased or decreased, seasonally. Our results can be
   used to refine estimates of energetic carrying capacity around roosts
   and in biological and landscape planning efforts.}},

Title = {{Effect of human disturbance on long-term habitat use and breeding
   success of the European Nightjar, Caprimulgus europaeus}},

Abstract = {{Land managers often respond to declining numbers of target species by
   creating additional areas of habitat. If these habitats are also subject
   to human disturbance, then their efforts may be wasted. The European
   Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a ground-nesting bird that is listed
   as a species of European Conservation Concern. It appears to be
   susceptible to human disturbance during the breeding season. We examined
   habitat use and reproductive success over 10 years in a breeding
   population on 1335 ha of managed land in Nottinghamshire, England. The
   study site was divided into a heavily disturbed section and a less
   disturbed section of equal habitat availability, forming a natural
   long-term experiment. The site is open to the public, and visitor
   numbers approximately doubled during the study. We found that overall
   Nightjar density was significantly lower and there were significantly
   fewer breeding pairs in the heavily disturbed habitat compared with the
   less disturbed habitat. However, average breeding success per pair, in
   terms of eggs and fledglings produced, was not significantly different
   between the two sections across years. Our findings suggest that human
   recreational disturbance may drastically alter settlement patterns and
   nest site selection of arriving females in some migratory groundnesting
   species and may reduce the utility of apparently suitable patches of
   remnant and created habitat. Land managers should bear this in mind when
   creating new areas of habitat that will also be accessible to the
   public. Our study also highlights the value of longterm population
   monitoring, which can detect trends that short-term studies may miss.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneity in avian richness-environment relationships along the
   Pacific Crest Trail}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Predictions of the responses of montane bird communities to climate
   change generally presuppose that species and assemblages hold constant
   relationships to temperature across large study regions. However,
   comparative studies of avian communities exploring the factors that
   currently shape species richness patterns rarely analyze relationships
   across neighboring ecological regions of the same mountain chain.
   Evaluations of the intrinsic regional differences in species-environment
   relationships are needed to better inform expectations of how bird
   communities may be affected by future climate change. In this study, we
   evaluated the relative importance of three environmental factors
   (temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity) in
   structuring avian richness patterns along a continuous mega-transect. We
   followed the route of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) (32.58 degrees N to
   42.00 degrees N, ranging in elevation from 365 to 4020 m) on the
   California cordillera and completed avian point counts on 3578
   systematically established survey plots. We divided this mega-transect
   into five sections, which corresponded to distinct ecological regions
   along the mountain chain. Regions differed both for elevation-richness
   patterns, exhibiting linear and unimodal trends, and for model-supported
   environmental drivers of patterns, with some richness-environment
   correlations changing sign across adjacent regions. These results were
   robust to sampling bias, regional species availability, and spatial
   autocorrelation. Although seasonal variation in avian movements may have
   limited influence on our results, we conclude that intrinsic regional
   environments affect bird species richness differently in each of these
   sections on the PCT, thus creating region-specific species-environment
   relationships. Appreciation of regional environmental heterogeneity will
   only increase in light of forecasted climate change, where regional
   predictions often diverge greatly from global trends, necessitating a
   site-specific approach to climate adaptation rather than `one size fits
   all' strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, North American prairies were strongly influenced by two
   natural disturbances, fire and grazing, and their interaction. However,
   the frequency and size of fires has been greatly altered over time,
   while native ungulates have been replaced by livestock; this may have
   had strong ecological influences on modern prairies. The feedback
   hypothesis proposes that grazing by ungulates will increase the duration
   of fire effects because ungulates will be attracted to burned patches.
   We conducted point-count surveys in burned-grazed, burned-ungrazed,
   unburned-grazed, and unburned-ungrazed sites over a 5-year period
   following fires that occurred naturally in 2006 in southern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, to test predictions related to avian community
   composition related to the feedback hypothesis. Generalized linear mixed
   models were used to analyze interactions among burning, grazing, and
   time since burning. Six of the nine avian species we studied responded
   positively or negatively to burning or grazing, although there were few
   statistically significant effects on the vegetation structure variables
   we measured. We found mixed evidence that grazing increased the duration
   of effects of burning, cumulatively providing little evidence for the
   feedback hypothesis. Nonetheless, effects of burning and grazing
   differed from and interacted with one another; for example, short-term
   effects of burning on Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii) and Baird's
   Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii) were greater than effects of grazing, and
   effects of grazing and burning in combination were frequently greater
   than effects of a single disturbance. Therefore, both should be
   integrated into management for the conservation of grassland songbirds.}},

Abstract = {{The Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica) is an aerial insectivore and a
   cavity-nesting/roosting specialist designated as threatened in several
   jurisdictions. As the occurrence of suitable chimneys declines, Chimney
   Swifts may increasingly nest and roost in tree cavities. It is therefore
   important to identify characteristics of suitable nest or roost trees
   and assess their frequency of occurrence. We reviewed 59 historic and
   modern records of trees used by Chimney Swifts to understand
   characteristics of suitable nest or roost trees. Chimney Swifts used at
   least 13 different deciduous and coniferous tree species. All of the
   trees were greater than 0.5 m diameter at breast height (DBH) and were
   described as hollow or having cavities. Nest or roost tree height was
   12.7 +/- 7.0 m (mean +/- SD; range: 3.6-28.0 m; n = 25) and DBH was 1.0
   m +/- 0.5 m (range 0.5-2.1 m; n = 21). According to our description of
   used trees, the number of suitably hollow Chimney Swift nest or roost
   trees may be two to three times higher, although still rare, in most
   unlogged compared to logged hardwood forests. Whether the current total
   supply of suitable nest or roost trees is sufficient to carry the
   anticipated increase in use by Chimney Swifts as chimney habitat is
   modified or deteriorates is unknown. Monitoring the frequency of use of
   tree cavities by nesting and roosting Chimney Swifts over time, and more
   robustly quantifying the availability of suitable tree cavities in
   different forest types for nesting and roosting Chimney Swifts,
   particularly in unlogged versus logged forests, are fruitful areas for
   future research.}},

Title = {{Chronic lack of breeding by Galapagos Blue-footed Boobies and associated
   population decline}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A survey of Blue-footed Boobies (Sula nebouxii excisa) throughout the
   taxon's range in Galapagos, Ecuador found similar to 6400 adults,
   compared to a rough estimate of 20,000 in the 1960s. Few pairs bred in
   2011-2013 and almost no birds in juvenile plumage were seen. Long-term
   data suggest that poor breeding began in 1998. Lack of recruitment over
   this period would mean that the current population is mostly elderly and
   experiencing senescent decline in performance. Anthropogenic effects
   such as introduced predators are unlikely to explain this decline
   because islands with and without such factors exhibited the same low
   breeding. The poor reproduction seems to be linked to diet. Previous
   work indicated that sardine and herring (Clupeidae) supported successful
   breeding, but these fish were mostly absent from the diet during this
   study, except in the central part of Galapagos, where most breeding
   attempts during this study occurred. Elsewhere in the eastern Pacific
   sardine abundance has decreased dramatically by natural processes in the
   last 15 years, as part of a well-documented and apparently natural
   cycle. This cyclic change in abundance provides a possible explanation
   for the recent demographic changes in Blue-footed Boobies in Galapagos.
   Whether natural or anthropogenic in origin, the implications of
   senescent decline in breeding ability and survival are dramatic for this
   genetically distinct icon of biodiversity and ecotourism.}},

Abstract = {{Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), an endemic North American
   passerine, requires frequent (<= 3 yr) prescribed fires to maintain
   preferred habitat conditions. Prescribed fires that coincide with the
   sparrow's nesting season are increasingly used to manage sparrow
   habitat, but concerns exist regarding the effects that nesting-season
   fires may pose to this understory-dwelling species. Previous studies
   suggested that threats posed by fires might be lessened by reducing the
   extent of prescribed fires, thereby providing unburned areas close to
   the areas where fires eliminate ground-cover vegetation. To assess this
   hypothesis, we monitored color-marked male Bachman's Sparrows on 2 sites
   where the extent of nesting-season fires differed 5-fold (> 70 ha vs. <
   15 ha). Monthly survival for males did not differ between the large-and
   small-extent treatments, and survival rates exceeded 90\% for all months
   except one during the second year of our study when fires were applied
   later in the season. Male densities also did not differ between
   treatments, but treatment-by-year interactions pointed to effects
   relating to the specific time that fires were applied. The distances
   separating observations of marked males before and after burns were
   smaller on small-extent treatments in the first year of study but larger
   on the small-extent treatments in the second year of study. Burn extents
   also had no consistent effect on postburn reproductive status. The
   largest extent we examined could have been too small to affect sparrow
   populations, but responses may also reflect sustainable metapopulation
   dynamics in a setting where a large sparrow population is maintained at
   a regional scale (> 100,000 ha) using frequent prescribed fire (<= 2-yr
   return intervals). Additional research is needed regarding the effects
   that nesting-season fires may have on small, isolated populations as
   well as sites where much larger burn extents (> 100 ha) or longer burn
   intervals (> 2 yr) are used.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Extensive fragmentation of the sagebrush shrubsteppe of western North
   America could be contributing to observed population declines of
   songbirds in sagebrush habitat. We examined whether habitat
   fragmentation impacts the reproduction of songbirds in sagebrush edge
   habitat near agriculture, and if potential impacts vary depending on the
   adjacent crop type. Specifically, we evaluated whether nest abundance
   and nest survival varied between orchard edge habitat, vineyard edge
   habitat, and interior habitat. We then examined whether the local nest
   predator community and vegetation could explain the differences
   detected. We detected fewer nests in edge than interior habitat. Nest
   abundance per songbird was also lower in edge than interior habitat,
   although only adjacent to vineyards. Nest predation was more frequent in
   orchard edge habitat than vineyard edge or interior habitat. Predators
   identified with nest cameras were primarily snakes, however, reduced
   nest survival in orchard edge habitat was not explained by differences
   in the abundance of snakes or any other predator species identified.
   Information theoretic analysis of daily survival rates showed that
   greater study plot shrub cover and lower grass height at nests were
   partially responsible for the lower rate of predation-specific daily
   nest survival rate (PDSR) observed in orchard edge habitat, but
   additional factors are likely important. Results of this study suggest
   that different crop types have different edge effects on songbirds
   nesting in sagebrush shrubsteppe, and that these reproductive edge
   effects may contribute to observed declines of these species. Habitat
   managers should avoid the creation of new orchard-sagebrush habitat
   edges to avoid further impacts on already declining songbird
   populations.}},

   models, with random effects to account for temporal (repeat sampling
   within years) and spatial (stations within stands) autocorrelation and
   variability associated with multiple observers. We tested whether
   regional and national Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) trends could, on
   average, predict trends in our study area. Significant increases in our
   study area outnumbered decreases by 12 species to 6, an opposite pattern
   compared to Alberta (6 versus 15, respectively) and Canada (9 versus
   20). Twenty-two species with relatively precise trend estimates
   (precision to detect > 30\% decline in 10 years; observed SE <=
   3.7\%/year) showed nonsignificant trends, similar to Alberta (24) and
   Canada (20). Precision-weighted trends for a sample of 19 species with
   both reliable trends at our site and small portions of their range
   covered by BBS in Canada were, on average, more negative for Alberta
   (1.34\% per year lower) and for Canada (1.15\% per year lower) relative
   to Fort Liard, though 95\% credible intervals still contained zero. We
   suggest that part of the differences could be attributable to local
   resource pulses (insect outbreak). However, we also suggest that the
   tendency for BBS route coverage to disproportionately sample more
   southerly, developed areas in the boreal forest could result in BBS
   trends that are not representative of range-wide trends for species
   whose range is centred farther north.}},

Abstract = {{Restrictions in technology have limited past habitat selection studies
   for many species to the home-range level, as a finer-scale understanding
   was often not possible. Consequently, these studies may not identify the
   true mechanism driving habitat selection patterns, which may influence
   how such results are applied in conservation. We used GPS dataloggers
   with digital video recorders to identify foraging modes and locations in
   which endangered Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) captured prey. We
   measured the coarse and fine-scale characteristics of vegetation at
   locations in which owls searched for, versus where they caught,
   vertebrate prey. Most prey items were caught using hover-hunting.
   Burrowing Owls searched for, and caught, vertebrate prey in all cover
   types, but were more likely to kill prey in areas with sparse and less
   dense vegetative cover. Management strategies designed to increase
   Burrowing Owl foraging success in the Canadian prairies should try to
   ensure a mosaic of vegetation heights across cover types.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In a rapidly changing climate, effective bird conservation requires not
   only reliable information about the current vulnerability of species of
   conservation concern, but also credible projections of their future
   vulnerability. Such projections may enable managers to preempt or reduce
   emerging climate-related threats through appropriate habitat management.
   We used NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to
   predict vulnerability to climate change of 168 bird species that breed
   in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA. The CCVI assesses
   species-specific exposure and sensitivity to climate change within a
   defined geographic area, through the integration of (a) species' range
   maps, (b) information about species' natural history traits and
   ecological relationships, (c) historic and current climate data, and (d)
   spatially explicit climate change projections. We conducted the
   assessment under two different downscaled climate models with divergent
   projections about future precipitation through the middle of the 21st
   century. Assessments differed relatively little under the two climate
   models. Of five CCVI vulnerability ranking categories, only one species,
   White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), received the most vulnerable
   rank, Extremely Vulnerable. No species received the second-highest
   vulnerability ranking, Highly Vulnerable. Sixteen species scored as
   Moderately Vulnerable using one or both climate models: Common Merganser
   (Mergus merganser), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Peregrine Falcon
   (Falco peregrinus), Prairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus), Spotted Sandpiper
   (Actitis macularius), Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa), Black Swift
   (Cypseloides niger), Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), American
   Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus),
   American Pipit (Anthus rubescens), Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch (Leucosticte
   tephrocotis), Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), and Evening Grosbeak
   (Coccothraustes vespertinus). Species associated with alpine/subalpine
   habitats and aquatic habitats received significantly more vulnerable
   rankings than birds associated with other habitats. In contrast, species
   of foothill, sagebrush, and chaparral habitats ranked as less vulnerable
   than other species, and our results suggest these species may respond to
   climate change in the region with population increases or range
   expansions.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed spatial and temporal variation in reporting probability of
   banded Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) shot by hunters
   in eastern North America and evaluated potential residual biases in kill
   rate estimation. Adult Greater Snow Geese were marked with reward
   (value: US\$10, \$20, \$30, \$50, and \$100) and standard bands (\$0,
   control) in the Canadian Arctic from 2003 to 2005. We used a spatially
   explicit multinomial model based on 200 direct recoveries from 4256
   banded geese to estimate reporting rate and harvest rate. We found that
   reporting rate for standard bands varied over time whereas harvest rate
   was higher in Canada than in the U. S. The reporting probability
   increased from 0.40 +/- 0.11 in the first year of the study to 0.82 +/-
   0.14 and 0.84 +/- 0.13 the second and third years, respectively.
   Overall, these reporting rates are higher than two previous estimates
   for this population, which leads to lower estimates of kill rate.
   However, the large annual differences in reporting rates found in this
   study lead to uncertainty in the estimation of kill rate. We suggest
   that the increase in reporting rate in the last two year of the study
   may be due to the dissemination of information among hunters regarding
   the presence of reward bands on birds, resulting in increased reporting
   rate for all bands. This raises issues about the need to adequately
   inform the public in such large-scale studies to avoid undesirable
   temporal trends over the course of the study.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Grassland bird species continue to decline steeply across North America.
   Road-based surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS)
   are often used to estimate trends and population sizes and to build
   species distribution models for grassland birds, although roadside
   survey counts may introduce bias in estimates because of differences in
   habitats along roadsides and in off-road surveys. We tested for
   differences in land cover composition and in the avian community on 21
   roadside-based survey routes and in an equal number of adjacent off-road
   walking routes in the grasslands of southern Alberta, Canada. Off-road
   routes (n = 225 point counts) had more native grassland and short shrubs
   and less fallow land and road area than the roadside routes (n = 225
   point counts). Consequently, 17 of the 39 bird species differed between
   the two route types in frequency of occurrence and relative abundance,
   measured using an indicator species analysis. Six species, including
   five obligate grassland species, were more prevalent at off-road sites;
   they included four species listed under the Canadian federal Species At
   Risk Act or listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife
   in Canada: Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), Baird's Sparrow
   (Ammodramus bairdii), the Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius
   ornatus), and McCown's Longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii). The six
   species were as much as four times more abundant on off-road sites.
   Species more prevalent along roadside routes included common species and
   those typical of farmland and other human-modified habitats, e. g., the
   European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), the Black-billed Magpie (Pica
   hudsonia), and the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus). Differences in
   avian community composition between roadside and off-road surveys
   suggest that the use of BBS data when generating population estimates or
   distribution models may overestimate certain common species and
   underestimate others of conservation concern. Our results highlight the
   need to develop appropriate corrections for bias in estimates derived
   from roadside sampling, and the need to design surveys that sample bird
   communities across a more representative cross-section of the landscape,
   both near and far from roads.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The incidental take of birds covered by the Migratory Birds Convention
   Act was estimated for activities undertaken in the mining sector. The
   scope of the analysis covered most of common mining activities, with the
   exception of oil sands extraction. The assessment looked at metals and
   mineral extraction, aggregate mining and quarrying, and peat extraction.
   There was virtually no IT identified as being associated with peat
   extraction because the main activity that has the potential to cause IT
   - the stripping of the vegetation layer at the beginning of operations -
   is often done in winter, while the removal of the upper peat layer to
   expose the mineable peat often takes place in late summer or fall. Once
   a bog is in production, it is inhospitable for birds and so there is no
   IT involved.
   In the case of metals and mineral extraction, there is a meaningful
   level of IT. There was a considerable level of uncertainty in the
   estimates of IT associated with mining, so that high and low estimates
   were generated. The range of these estimates is very likely to include
   the actual value, in the opinion of the author. The variables with the
   greatest uncertainty were:
   The proportion of land clearing that takes place during nesting season;
   and
   The amount of land cleared annually, which is primarily associated with
   the expansion of open pit facilities.
   There was a considerable variation in the estimate of the mine
   footprints between B. C. Saskatchewan and Ontario, however the author
   has considerable confidence in the numbers because all values were
   derived from data in the case of B. C. and from extensive discussions
   with government and industry staff in the sector, in the case of
   Saskatchewan and Ontario. Thus, if the amount of IT is near the upper
   end of the metal mining estimate, then pits and quarries operations
   produce roughly the same level of IT as metal mining does. However, the
   low end estimate of IT associated with metals mining is approximately
   15\% of the estimated IT associated with pits and quarries.
   In the case of pits and quarries, two sources of IT were identified -
   the clearing of the land to establish or enlarge a pit (vegetation
   removal and overburden stripping) and the extraction of the material
   that can cause IT to killdeer and bank swallows. There were some data
   available which were used to base the estimates of bank swallow
   mortality on, however the author does not have a great deal of
   confidence in these data since they are based on a relatively small
   sample size. Key variables which have a significant amount of
   uncertainty associated with them include:
   The average number of nests in a colony;
   The number of colonies per pit;
   The percentage of pits that have operations and mortality in them in any
   given year; and
   Rates of colony destruction.
   High and low estimates were not developed because there were data
   available, however as mentioned above, the author is not highly
   confident of the precision of the values however he believes they are
   within reasonable range of true values.

Abstract = {{Although mortality of birds from collisions with vehicles is estimated
   to be in the millions in the USA, Europe, and the UK, to date, no
   estimates exist for Canada. To address this, we calculated an estimate
   of annual avian mortality attributed to vehicular collisions during the
   breeding and fledging season, in Canadian ecozones, by applying North
   American literature values for avian mortality to Canadian road
   networks. Because owls are particularly susceptible to collisions with
   vehicles, we also estimated the number of roadkilled Barn owls (Tyto
   alba) in its last remaining range within Canada. (This species is on the
   IUCN red list and is also listed federally as threatened; Committee on
   the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada 2010, International Union
   for the Conservation of Nature 2012). Through seven Canadian studies in
   existence, 80 species and 2,834 specimens have been found dead on roads
   representing species from 14 orders of birds. On Canadian 1 and 2-lane
   paved roads outside of major urban centers, the unadjusted number of
   bird mortalities/yr during an estimated 4-mo (122-d) breeding and
   fledging season for most birds in Canada was 4,650,137 on roads
   traversing through deciduous, coniferous, cropland, wetlands and
   nonagricultural landscapes with less than 10\% treed area. On average,
   this represents 1,167 birds killed/100 km in Canada. Adjusted for
   scavenging, this estimate was 13,810,906 (3,462 dead birds/100 km). For
   barn owls, the unadjusted number of birds killed annually on 4-lane
   roads during the breeding and fledging season, within the species
   geographic range in southern British Columbia, was estimated as 244 owls
   and, when adjusted for scavenging and observer bias (3.6 factor), the
   total was 851 owls.}},

Title = {{Estimated Number of Birds Killed by House Cats (Felis catus) in Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Predation by house cats (Felis catus) is one of the largest
   human-related sources of mortality for wild birds in the United States
   and elsewhere, and has been implicated in extinctions and population
   declines of several species. However, relatively little is known about
   this topic in Canada. The objectives of this study were to provide
   plausible estimates for the number of birds killed by house cats in
   Canada, identify information that would help improve those estimates,
   and identify species potentially vulnerable to population impacts. In
   total, cats are estimated to kill between 100 and 350 million birds per
   year in Canada (> 95\% of estimates were in this range), with the
   majority likely to be killed by feral cats. This range of estimates is
   based on surveys indicating that Canadians own about 8.5 million pet
   cats, a rough approximation of 1.4 to 4.2 million feral cats, and
   literature values of predation rates from studies conducted elsewhere.
   Reliability of the total kill estimate would be improved most by better
   knowledge of feral cat numbers and diet in Canada, though any data on
   birds killed by cats in Canada would be helpful. These estimates suggest
   that 2-7\% of birds in southern Canada are killed by cats per year. Even
   at the low end, predation by house cats is probably the largest
   human-related source of bird mortality in Canada. Many species of birds
   are potentially vulnerable to at least local population impacts in
   southern Canada, by virtue of nesting or feeding on or near ground
   level, and habitat choices that bring them into contact with
   human-dominated landscapes where cats are abundant. Because cat
   predation is likely to remain a primary source of bird mortality in
   Canada for some time, this issue needs more scientific attention in
   Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Many human activities in Canada kill wild birds, yet the relative
   magnitude of mortality from different sources and the consequent effects
   on bird populations have not been systematically evaluated. We
   synthesize recent estimates of avian mortality in Canada from a range of
   industrial and other human activities, to provide context for the
   estimates from individual sources presented in this special feature. We
   assessed the geographic, seasonal, and taxonomic variation in the
   magnitude of national-scale mortality and in population-level effects on
   species or groups across Canada, by combining these estimates into a
   stochastic model of stage-specific mortality. The range of estimates of
   avian mortality from each source covers several orders of magnitude,
   and, numerically, landbirds were the most affected group. In total, we
   estimate that approximately 269 million birds and 2 million nests are
   destroyed annually in Canada, the equivalent of over 186 million
   breeding individuals. Combined, cat predation and collisions with
   windows, vehicles, and transmission lines caused > 95\% of all
   mortality; the highest industrial causes of mortality were the
   electrical power and agriculture sectors. Other mortality sources such
   as fisheries bycatch can have important local or species-specific
   impacts, but are relatively small at a national scale. Mortality rates
   differed across species and families within major bird groups,
   highlighting that mortality is not simply proportional to abundance. We
   also found that mortality is not evenly spread across the country; the
   largest mortality sources are coincident with human population
   distribution, while industrial sources are concentrated in southern
   Ontario, Alberta, and southwestern British Columbia. Many species are
   therefore likely to be vulnerable to cumulative effects of multiple
   human-related impacts. This assessment also confirms the high
   uncertainty in estimating human-related avian mortality in terms of
   species involved, potential for population-level effects, and the
   cumulative effects of mortality across the landscape. Effort is still
   required to improve these estimates, and to guide conservation efforts
   to minimize direct mortality caused by human activities on Canada's wild
   bird populations. As avian mortality represents only a portion of the
   overall impact to avifauna, indirect effects such as habitat
   fragmentation and alteration, site avoidance, disturbance, and related
   issues must also be carefully considered.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance in conjunction with slow
   population recovery has raised conservation concerns over impacts to
   raptor species from industrial development in pristine areas of their
   North American breeding range. We evaluated whether the presence of two
   diamond mines resulted in negative effects to nest use and hatch success
   of breeding falcons in the southern Arctic barren-grounds of the
   Northwest Territories. A total of 20 nest sites of Peregrine Falcon
   (Falco peregrinus) and Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) breeding within 26
   km of the Diavik and Ekati diamond mines were monitored annually during
   1998 to 2010. The objective of the study was to test the effects of
   distance from mines, relative nest age, rainfall, small mammal
   abundance, and mine activity levels on nest occupancy and hatch rates.
   Model selection results indicated that nests that were older were more
   likely and consistently used than nests that were established more
   recently. A decrease in nest use associated with the mines was not
   detected. Hatch success was best explained by a positive association
   with distance from development and a negative trend over the study
   period, however, these effects were weak. Hatch success of nests within
   and beyond an estimated 5.9 km distance threshold was similar, and for
   nest sites within this distance was unrelated to annual changes in
   accumulated mine footprint area through time. Hatch success for nest
   sites near Diavik was unrelated to changes in this mine's activity
   through time. Although natural and anthropogenic effects were generally
   weak, the lines of evidence suggested that the observed patterns were
   more likely the result of natural factors operating at a regional scale
   than more localized effects from the activity of two diamond mines.}},

Abstract = {{There is an imminent need for conservation and best-practice management
   efforts in marine ecosystems where global-scale declines in the
   biodiversity and biomass of large vertebrate predators are increasing
   and marine communities are being altered. We examine two marine-based
   industries that incidentally take migratory birds in Canada: (1)
   commercial fisheries, through bycatch, and (2) offshore oil and gas
   exploration, development, and production. We summarize information from
   the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new
   information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and
   scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest
   levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined
   take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within
   the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions
   was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector,
   mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the
   discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with
   platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas
   sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the
   uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are
   unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects
   on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and
   monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related
   mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by
   local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced
   waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from
   collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality
   from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine
   impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our
   current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality
   of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management
   actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data
   collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of
   mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in
   Canada.}},

   generated preliminary estimates of the magnitude of avian incidental
   take due to roadside maintenance operations across Canada. Eighteen
   roadside nesting species, all protected under the Migratory Birds
   Convention Act, were identified through the literature and expert
   advice. To model the impacts on these species, this study took a
   focal-species approach, in which estimates of incidental take were
   modeled for 6 focal species and then extrapolated to 12 other species
   which had similar ecologies. The estimates of take for the focal species
   were based on:
   their nesting ecology (i. e. nesting dates, number of eggs laid,
   incubation periods) and range in Canada;
   preferred nesting habitats relative to the availability of the habitats
   along roadsides; and
   the amount of road and maintenance activities conducted in each
   province. We used a modeling approach which integrated the information
   above with assumed and calculated distributions of nesting period, road
   maintenance schedules, egg laying, etc.
   Estimates of take were made for these species using a combination of
   modeling and extrapolation. Incidental take ranged from 7 (Lark Sparrow)
   to 820,000 (American Robin) individuals per year across Canada. We
   estimate that approximately 861,000 nestlings, eggs, and adults (only
   waterfowl adults are susceptible to incidental take) are killed by
   incidental take per year. However, this analysis, although very
   detailed, is subject to a number of caveats which suggest that the
   results should be interpreted with considerable caution.
   There are no published criteria for what constitutes biologically
   significant levels of incidental take for bird populations. However, a
   widely accepted criterion for identifying key habitat sites for
   population conservation may serve as a suitable surrogate. Sites
   believed to support at least 1\% of a Canadian population are considered
   to be key habitat sites, and their loss would potentially have a
   significant detrimental impact on the total population. By extension,
   losses to incidental take of 1\% or more of a species Canadian
   population could be considered biologically significant (C. Machtans,
   pers. com.).
   As a proportion of total Canadian populations, take was estimated to be
   less than 1\% for all species, ranging from 0.0057\% (Clay-colored
   Sparrow) to 0.5880\% (American Robin). According to the 1\% criterion,
   incidental take due to roadside maintenance operations is not a
   biologically significant mortality factor in Canada.}},

Title = {{An Estimate of Nest Loss in Canada Due to Industrial Forestry Operations}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Annual loss of nests by industrial (nonwoodlot) forest harvesting in
   Canada was estimated using two avian point-count data sources: (1) the
   Boreal Avian Monitoring Project (BAM) dataset for provinces operating in
   this biome and (2) available data summarized for the major (nonboreal)
   forest regions of British Columbia. Accounting for uncertainty in the
   proportion of harvest occurring during the breeding season and in avian
   nesting densities, our estimate ranges from 616 thousand to 2.09 million
   nests. Estimates of the impact on numbers of individuals recruited into
   the adult breeding population were made based on the application of
   survivorship estimates at various stages of the life cycle. Future
   improvements to this estimate are expected as better and more extensive
   avian breeding pair density estimates become available and as provincial
   forestry statistics become more refined, spatially and temporally. The
   effect of incidental take due to forestry is not uniform and is
   disproportionately centered in the southern boreal. Those species whose
   ranges occur primarily in these regions are most at risk for industrial
   forestry in general and for incidental take in particular. Refinements
   to the nest loss estimate for industrial forestry in Canada will be
   achieved primarily through the provision of more accurate estimates of
   the area of forest harvested annually during the breeding season
   stratified by forest type and Bird Conservation Region (BCR). A better
   understanding of survivorship among life-history stages for forest birds
   would also allow for better modeling of the effect of nest loss on adult
   recruitment. Finally, models are needed to project legacy effects of
   forest harvesting on avian populations that take into account forest
   succession and accompanying cumulative effects of landscape change.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in
   northeastern British Columbia have received interest as a site of
   industrial wind energy development but, simultaneously, have been the
   subject of concern about wind development coinciding with a known
   migratory corridor of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). We tracked and
   quantified eagle flights that crossed or followed ridgelines slated for
   one such wind development. We found that hourly passage rates during
   fall migration peaked at midday and increased by 17\% with each 1 km/h
   increase in wind speed and by 11\% with each 1 degrees C increase in
   temperature. The propensity to cross the ridge tops where turbines would
   be situated differed between age classes, with juvenile eagles almost
   twice as likely to traverse the ridge-top area as adults or subadults.
   During fall migration, Golden Eagles were more likely to cross ridges at
   turbine heights (risk zone, < 150 m above ground) under headwinds or
   tailwinds, but this likelihood decreased with increasing temperature.
   Conversely, during spring migration, eagles were more likely to move
   within the ridge-top area under eastern crosswinds. Identifying Golden
   Eagle flight routes and altitudes with respect to major weather systems
   and local topography in the Rockies may help identify scenarios in which
   the potential for collisions is greatest at this and other
   installations.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality from birds colliding with windows in buildings may be
   ecologically significant. Although data are sparse, we estimated the
   number of birds killed by this means in Canada. We made distinct models
   for three classes of buildings: houses, low-rise commercial and
   institutional buildings, and tall buildings. Estimates were developed
   using Monte Carlo-based simulations incorporating uncertainties and
   based on distributions that best fit available data or conceptual
   models. We estimate that about 25 million (range 16 - 42 M) birds are
   killed by colliding with windows in Canada annually. The assumptions
   used in our analyses are identified in detail so that subsequent efforts
   can address the uncertainties. Houses likely cause 90\% of
   building-related mortalities, low-rise buildings slightly less than
   10\%, and tall buildings approximately 1\%. The disproportionate
   contribution of mortality caused by houses is a function of their
   relative number compared to the two other classes of buildings. Our
   review found that warblers and sparrows were the most commonly killed
   birds at low-rise and tall buildings, and insufficient information
   exists on species deaths at houses to determine proportions. Targeted
   mitigation for certain tall buildings and a segment of the low-rise
   building types could significantly reduce the total mortality for both
   these building types. Mitigation strategies are now widely available,
   including architectural guidance produced by numerous cities in North
   America as well as specific products suitable for home use to reduce the
   number of birds colliding with windows.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A serious impediment to estimating the impact of pesticides on migratory
   birds is the lack of comprehensive pesticide use data. Canada is one of
   the few developed countries that do not collect such information. A
   clear recommendation of this report (and of many others) is that Canada
   should establish a pesticide use reporting system.
   Based on areas in various crop types and on low, average and high
   pesticide use patterns for those same crops in the US, our best estimate
   for the incidental take from pesticides in Canada is between 0.96 and
   4.4 million bird annually. This estimate assumes a kill rate of
   approximately 0.52 - 2.4 birds per hectare - the range from several
   industry studies carried out in typical farmland. A very approximate
   expert opinion is that a nest could be lost for every 4 birds killed.
   Given average nest success rates, this would add 50\% more individuals
   to the above total.
   The number of birds killed by pesticides has been decreasing as more
   toxic products are slowly being replaced for human health reasons.
   However, several potential impacts of pesticides, namely reproductive
   and indirect effects are not included in this total. Large kills of
   migrating birds are also not considered here although this would be more
   of a problem for a full accounting of pesticide impacts under US
   conditions than for Canada.
   Approximately half of the total estimated kill is in Saskatchewan. The
   impact from pesticides is thought to be a clear contribution to the
   steep decline shown by several of grassland/farmland species. Because
   birds are killed on the breeding grounds, and because both adults and
   nests are vulnerable, this impact is proportionately higher than similar
   estimates derived for other sources of mortality.
   Mitigation of kills is relatively easy. The products that have a high
   probability of causing avian mortality have been identified. In most
   cases, substitution products of lower toxicity to birds already exist.
   Regulatory inaction is the only impediment to a reduction of the direct
   incidental take. Chronic and indirect effects will be slightly harder to
   mitigate although here also, much information exists on which products
   carry the highest risk.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide marine protected areas (MPAs) have been designated to protect
   marine resources, including top predators such as seabirds. There is no
   conclusive information on whether protected areas can improve population
   trends of seabirds when these are further exploited as tourist
   attractions, an activity that has increased in past decades. Humboldt
   Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic Penguins (S.
   magellanicus) breed sympatrically on Punihuil Islets, two small coastal
   islands off the west coast of Chiloe Island (41 degrees S) in southern
   Chile that are subject to exploitation for tourism. Our goal was to
   compare the population size of the mixed colony of Humboldt and
   Magellanic Penguins before and after protection from unregulated tourism
   and freely roaming goats in 1997. For this purpose, two censuses were
   conducted in 2004 and 2008, and the numbers compared with those obtained
   in 1997 by other authors. The proportion of occupied, unoccupied, and
   collapsed/flooded burrows changed between years; there were 68\% and
   34\% fewer collapsed burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in
   1997. For the total number of burrows of both species, we counted 48\%
   and 63\% more burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. We
   counted 13\% more burrows of Humboldt Penguins in 2008 than in 1997, and
   for Magellanic Penguins, we estimated a 64\% increase in burrows in
   2008. Presumably, this was as a result of habitat improvement
   attributable to the exclusion of tourists and the removal of goats from
   the islets. Although tourist visits to the islets are prohibited,
   tourism activities around the colonies are prevalent and need to be
   taken into account to promote appropriate management.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are vulnerable to collisions with human-made fixed structures.
   Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few
   estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the
   existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission
   lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality
   from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of
   studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty
   about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions
   with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and
   scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and
   subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely
   incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of
   estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with
   transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and
   crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across
   Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1
   million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias
   corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking
   into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million
   to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across
   Canada and the northern U. S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird
   groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes,
   which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups
   that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e. g.,
   waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current
   levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts
   on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk,
   including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western
   Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be
   more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand
   impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are
   preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides estimates for three sources related to power
   industry in Canada, which cause avian mortality: electrocutions,
   construction and transmission line maintenance, and water reservoirs.
   Estimates of avian mortality due to electrocution mortality for Canada
   (number of poles{*}birds/pole/year) ranged from 160,836 to 801,962 birds
   annually. Impacts are likely to be greater on raptors, owls, herons and
   cranes than on smaller, but more highly productive birds. Construction
   of transmission line likely impacted 2,588,494 nests and transmission
   line maintenance can possibly affect 388,274 nests each year. Avian
   mortality related to the construction and maintenance of transmission
   and distribution power lines is relatively small, and likely does not
   cause any significant impact at the population level. Operations of
   large water reservoirs created for hydro-power will rarely affect adults
   but result in the destruction of eggs in nidifigous species such as
   waterfowl and shorebirds or altricial species nestlings. An approximate
   estimate of avian mortality for Quebec due to hydro-power reservoirs
   gave us 152,162 nests/year, and does not cause a significant impact on a
   population level for any species. However, reservoirs within the
   breeding range of the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), an endangered
   species, could affect the local population if highly estimated losses
   were recurrent every year.}},

Title = {{Estimated Mortality of Selected Migratory Bird Species from Mowing and

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical operations such as mowing, tilling, seeding, and harvesting
   are well-known sources of direct avian mortality in agricultural fields.
   However, there are currently no mortality rate estimates available for
   any species group or larger jurisdiction. Even reviews of sources of
   mortality in birds have failed to address mechanical disturbance in farm
   fields. To overcome this information gap we provide estimates of total
   mortality rates by mechanical operations for five selected species
   across Canada. In our step-by-step modeling approach we (i) quantified
   the amount of various types of agricultural land in each Bird
   Conservation Region (BCR) in Canada, (ii) estimated population densities
   by region and agricultural habitat type for each selected species, (iii)
   estimated the average timing of mechanical agricultural activities, egg
   laying, and fledging, (iv) and used these values and additional
   demographical parameters to derive estimates of total mortality by
   species within each BCR. Based on our calculations the total annual
   estimated incidental take of young ranged from similar to 138,000 for
   Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) to as much as similar to 941,000 for
   Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Net losses to the fall
   flight of birds, i. e., those birds that would have fledged successfully
   in the absence of mechanical disturbance, were, for example similar to
   321,000 for Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and similar to 483,000 for
   Savannah Sparrow. Although our estimates are subject to an unknown
   degree of uncertainty, this assessment is a very important first step
   because it provides a broad estimate of incidental take for a set of
   species that may be particularly vulnerable to mechanical operations and
   a starting point for future refinements of model parameters if and when
   they become available.}},

Title = {{Estimated Avian Nest Loss Associated with Oil and Gas Exploration and
   Extraction in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Annual mortality within bird populations can be attributed to numerous
   sources; however, the extent to which anthropogenic sources of mortality
   contribute to avian demography is largely unknown. Quantifying the
   relative magnitude of human-related avian mortality could inform
   conservation efforts, particularly if multiple sources of human-related
   mortality can be contrasted. The unintentional destruction of nests and
   their contents by industrial activities conducted during the breeding
   season of resident and migratory birds presumably leads to one such
   source of human-caused avian mortality. As part of a broader effort to
   quantify major sources of human-related avian mortality, we estimated
   the magnitude of nest loss resulting from the terrestrial oil and gas
   sector in Canada, including: (1) seismic exploration, (2) pipeline
   right-of-way clearing, (3) well pad clearing, and (4) oil sands mining
   within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). We estimated nest
   losses as the product of estimated nest densities, the area disturbed
   annually, and the proportion of annual disturbance presumed to occur
   during the breeding season. The estimated number of nests disturbed
   annually by all oil and gas sectors combined ranged between 11,840 -
   60,380. Interannual variation in exploration and extraction, and
   uncertainty in nest densities and the proportion of the disturbances
   occurring during the breeding season contributed to the variation.
   Accounting for natural mortality suggests an estimated loss of 10,200 -
   41,150 (range) potential recruits into the migratory bird population in
   a subsequent year. Although nest destruction is only one small component
   of the potential impacts of the oil and gas industry upon avian
   populations, these estimates establish a baseline for comparison with
   other sources of human-caused avian mortality. Models are now needed to
   compare nest losses against the legacy effects of oil and gas sector
   habitat disturbances and associated cumulative effects so that
   mitigation efforts can be prioritized.}},

Title = {{Canadian Estimate of Bird Mortality Due to Collisions and Direct Habitat
   Loss Associated with Wind Turbine Developments}},

Abstract = {{We estimated impacts on birds from the development and operation of wind
   turbines in Canada considering both mortality due to collisions and loss
   of nesting habitat. We estimated collision mortality using data from
   carcass searches for 43 wind farms, incorporating correction factors for
   scavenger removal, searcher efficiency, and carcasses that fell beyond
   the area searched. On average, 8.2 +/- 1.4 birds (95\% C.I.) were killed
   per turbine per year at these sites, although the numbers at individual
   wind farms varied from 0 - 26.9 birds per turbine per year. Based on
   2955 installed turbines (the number installed in Canada by December
   2011), an estimated 23,300 birds (95\% C.I. 20,000 - 28,300) would be
   killed from collisions with turbines each year. We estimated direct
   habitat loss based on data from 32 wind farms in Canada. On average,
   total habitat loss per turbine was 1.23 ha, which corresponds to an
   estimated total habitat loss due to wind farms nationwide of 3635 ha.
   Based on published estimates of nest density, this could represent
   habitat for similar to 5700 nests of all species. Assuming nearby
   habitats are saturated, and 2 adults displaced per nest site, effects of
   direct habitat loss are less than that of direct mortality. Installed
   wind capacity is growing rapidly, and is predicted to increase more than
   10-fold over the next 10-15 years, which could lead to direct mortality
   of approximately 233,000 birds / year, and displacement of 57,000 pairs.
   Despite concerns about the impacts of biased correction factors on the
   accuracy of mortality estimates, these values are likely much lower than
   those from collisions with some other anthropogenic sources such as
   windows, vehicles, or towers, or habitat loss due to many other forms of
   development. Species composition data suggest that < 0.2\% of the
   population of any species is currently affected by mortality or
   displacement from wind turbine development. Therefore, population level
   impacts are unlikely, provided that highly sensitive or rare habitats,
   as well as concentration areas for species at risk, are avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behavior that reduces vulnerability to predation can affect
   population dynamics of animals. Temperate-nesting Canada Geese (Branta
   canadensis maxima) have increased steadily throughout the Atlantic
   flyway and have become a nuisance in some parts of their range. The
   objective of our study was to describe movements and habitat use during
   the postbreeding period of Canada Geese recently established in southern
   Quebec. More specifically, we wanted to determine whether geese were
   using areas where hunting was allowed to assess the potential of harvest
   to control the number of geese. We tracked a sample of geese fitted with
   radio or conventional alphanumeric collars throughout the fall in three
   zones characterized by different habitats and hunting pressure. Before
   the hunting season, geese left the breeding area where hunting was
   allowed to reach suburban areas where firearm discharge was prohibited
   or hunters' numbers were low. These postbreeding movements occurred when
   juveniles were approximately three months old. We observed few local
   movements among zones once migrant geese from northern breeding
   populations reached the study area. Radio-collared geese used mainly
   natural habitats (75.4 +/- 2.6\%), followed by urban (14.4 +/- 2.7\%),
   and agricultural habitats (10.3 +/- 0.8\%). They were located 73.8 +/-
   6.2\% of the time in areas where hunting was prohibited. Geese that
   attended their juveniles during brood rearing were more prone to use
   areas where firearm discharge was restricted than geese that had
   abandoned or lost their brood. This study shows that under the
   prevailing regulations, the potential of hunting to manage the
   increasing breeding population of Canada Geese in southern Quebec is
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{Silvicultural treatments have been shown to alter the composition of
   species assemblages in numerous taxa. However, the intensity and
   persistence of these effects have rarely been documented. We used a
   before-after, control-impact (BACI) paired design, i.e., five pairs of
   25-ha study plots, 1-control and 1-treated plot, to quantify changes in
   the density of eight forest bird species in response to selection
   harvesting over six breeding seasons, one year pre- and five years
   postharvest. Focal species included mature forest associates, i.e.,
   Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) and Black-throated Green Warbler
   (Setophaga virens), forest generalists, i.e., Yellow-bellied Sapsucker
   (Sphyrapicus varius) and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus),
   early-seral specialists, i.e., Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis
   philadelphia) and Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica),
   species associated with shrubby forest gaps, i.e., Black-throated Blue
   Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and mid-seral species, i.e., American
   Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). As predicted, we found a negative
   numerical response to the treatment in the Black-throated Green Warbler,
   no treatment effect in the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, and a positive
   treatment effect in early-seral specialists. We only detected a year
   effect in the Northern Parula and the American Redstart. There was
   evidence for a positive treatment effect on the Swainson's Thrush when
   the regeneration started to reach the pole stage, i.e., fifth year
   postharvest. These findings suggest that selection harvesting has the
   potential to maintain diverse avian assemblages while allowing
   sustainable management of timber supply, but future studies should
   determine whether mature-forest associates can sustain second-and
   third-entry selection harvest treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The boreal forest of western Canada is being dissected by seismic lines
   used for oil and gas exploration. The vast amount of edge being created
   is leading to concerns that core habitat will be reduced for forest
   interior species for extended periods of time. The Ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocapilla) is a boreal songbird known to be sensitive to newly created
   seismic lines because it does not include newly cut lines within its
   territory. We examined multiple hypotheses to explain potential
   mechanisms causing this behavior by mapping Ovenbird territories near
   lines with varying states of vegetation regeneration. The best model to
   explain line exclusion behavior included the number of neighboring
   conspecifics, the amount of bare ground, leaf-litter depth, and canopy
   closure. Ovenbirds exclude recently cut seismic lines from their
   territories because of lack of protective cover (lower tree and shrub
   cover) and because of reduced food resources due to large areas of bare
   ground. Food reduction and perceived predation risk effects seem to be
   mitigated once leaf litter (depth and extent of cover) and woody
   vegetation cover are restored to forest interior levels. However, as
   conspecific density increases, lines are more likely to be used as
   landmarks to demarcate territorial boundaries, even when woody
   vegetation cover and leaf litter are restored. This behavior can reduce
   territory density near seismic lines by changing the spatial
   distribution of territories. Landmark effects are longer lasting than
   the effects from reduced food or perceived predation risk because canopy
   height and tree density take >40 years to recover to forest interior
   levels. Mitigation of seismic line impacts on Ovenbirds should focus on
   restoring forest cover as quickly as possible after line cutting.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that although large populations may appear able to
   withstand predation and disturbance, added stochasticity in population
   growth rate (lambda) increases the risk of dramatic population declines.
   Approximately half of the Aleutian Islands' population of Least Auklets
   (Aethia pusilla) breed at one large colony at Kiska Island in the
   presence of introduced Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) whose population
   erupts periodically. We evaluated two management plans, do nothing or
   eradicate rats, for this colony, and performed stochastic elasticity
   analysis to focus future research and management. Our results indicated
   that Least Auklets breeding at Kiska Island had the lowest absolute
   value of growth rate and more variable lambda's (neither statistically
   significant) during 2001-2010, when compared with rat-free colonies at
   Buldir and Kasatochi islands. We found variability in the annual
   proportional change in population size among islands with Kiska Island
   having the fastest rate of decline, 78\% over 20 years. Under the
   assumption that the eradication of rats would result in vital rates
   similar to those observed at rat-free Buldir and Kasatochi islands, we
   found the projected population decline decreased from 78\% to 24\% over
   20 years. Overall, eradicating rats at Kiska Island is not likely to
   increase Least Auklet vital rates, but will decrease the amount of
   variation in lambda, resulting in a significantly slower rate of
   population decline. We recommend the eradication of rats from Kiska
   Island to decrease the probability of dramatic population declines and
   ensure the future persistence of this important colony.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive success of Common Loons (Gavia immer) is a powerful
   indicator of aquatic ecosystem health, especially in relation to mercury
   and acid precipitation. We examined relationships between Common Loon
   reproductive success and longitude, year, lake area, and pH across
   southern Canada using data collected from 1992 to 2010 by participants
   in Bird Studies Canada's Canadian Lakes Loon Survey. Our goal was to
   indirectly describe the health of lakes in southern Canada with respect
   to mercury and acid precipitation. The overall model-predicted number of
   six-week-old young per pair per year was 0.59 (95\% confidence limits:
   0.56-0.62). Six-week-old young per pair per year decreased by 0.19 from
   west-to-east (-127 degrees to -52 degrees longitude), decreased by 0.14
   between 1992 and 2010, increased by 0.22 as lake area increased from 10
   to 3000 ha, and increased by 0.43 as acidity decreased from pH 5 to 9.
   The relationships were likely linked to acid-and temperature-mediated
   exposure to methylmercury and/or acid-induced reductions in forage fish.
   The temporal decrease was unexpectedly steeper in southwestern than in
   southeastern Canada. Projections suggested that reproductive success
   across southern Canada may not drop below the demographic source-sink
   threshold until similar to 2016 (range: 2009-2029). Reproductive success
   on pH 6.0 lakes, however, may have passed below the source-sink
   threshold as early as similar to 2001 (1995-2009), whereas reproductive
   success on pH 8.0 lakes may not pass below the threshold until similar
   to 2034 (2019-2062). There were similar to 0.1 more six-week-old young
   per pair per year on 2500 ha lakes than on 20 ha lakes. Reproductive
   success crossed below the source-sink threshold on 20 ha lakes at pH 6.4
   (5.8-7.1) and on 2500 ha lakes at pH 5.5 (4.1-6.6). Our results show
   that citizen science is powerful for monitoring ecosystem health and
   indirectly support further action to abate emissions of mercury and the
   harmful components of acid precipitation throughout North America and
   globally.}},

Abstract = {{Wilson's Warbler (Cardellina pusilla; WIWA) has been declining for
   several decades, possibly because of habitat loss. We compared occupancy
   of territorial males in two habitat types of Quebec's boreal forest,
   alder (Alnus spp.) scrubland and recent clear-cuts. Singing males
   occurred in clusters, their occupancy was similar in both habitats, but
   increased with the amount of alder or clear-cut within 400 m of
   point-count stations. A despotic distribution of males between habitats
   appeared unlikely, because there were no differences in morphology
   between males captured in clear-cuts vs. alder. Those results contrast
   with the prevailing view, mostly based on western populations, that WIWA
   are wetland or riparian specialists, and provide the first evidence for
   a preference for large tracts of habitat in this species. Clear-cuts in
   the boreal forest may benefit WIWA by supplying alternative nesting
   habitat. However, the role of clear-cuts as source or sink habitats
   needs to be addressed with data on reproduction.}},

   Species-Habitat Relationships}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Expert knowledge-based species-habitat relationships are used
   extensively to guide conservation planning, particularly when data are
   scarce. Purported relationships describe the initial state of knowledge,
   but are rarely tested. We assessed support in the data for suitability
   rankings of vegetation types based on expert knowledge for three
   terrestrial avian species in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the
   United States. Experts used published studies, natural history, survey
   data, and field experience to rank vegetation types as optimal,
   suitable, and marginal. We used single-season occupancy models, coupled
   with land cover and Breeding Bird Survey data, to examine the hypothesis
   that patterns of occupancy conformed to species-habitat suitability
   rankings purported by experts. Purported habitat suitability was
   validated for two of three species. As predicted for the Eastern
   Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens) and Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla),
   occupancy was strongly influenced by vegetation types classified as
   ``optimal habitat{''} by the species suitability rankings for nuthatches
   and wood-pewees. Contrary to predictions, Red-headed Woodpecker
   (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) models that included vegetation types as
   covariates received similar support by the data as models without
   vegetation types. For all three species, occupancy was also related to
   sampling latitude. Our results suggest that covariates representing
   other habitat requirements might be necessary to model occurrence of
   generalist species like the woodpecker. The modeling approach described
   herein provides a means to test expert knowledge-based species-habitat
   relationships, and hence, help guide conservation planning.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that well-connected networks
   of forest habitat facilitate animal movement and contribute to species'
   persistence and thereby the maintenance of biodiversity. Many structural
   and functional connectivity metrics have been proposed, e.g., distance
   to nearest neighboring patch or graph-based measures, but the relative
   importance of these measures in contrast to nesting habitat at fine
   spatial scales is not well established. With graph-based measures of
   connectivity, Euclidean distances between forest patches can be directly
   related to the preferred gap crossing distances of a bird (functional
   connectivity). We determined the relative predictive power of nesting
   habitat, forest cover, and structural or functional connectivity
   measures in describing the breeding distribution of Hooded Warblers
   (Setophaga citrina) over two successive breeding seasons in a region
   highly fragmented by agriculture in southern Ontario. Logistic
   regression models of nesting occurrence patterns were compared using
   Akaike's information criterion and relative effect sizes were compared
   using odds ratios. Our results provide support for the expectation that
   nest-site characteristics are indeed related to the breeding
   distribution of S. citrina. However, models based on nesting habitat
   alone were 4.7 times less likely than a model including functional
   connectivity as a predictor for the breeding distribution of S. citrina.
   Models of nest occurrence in relation to surrounding forest cover had
   lower model likelihoods than models that included graph-based functional
   connectivity, but these measures were highly confounded. Graph-based
   measures of connectivity explained more variation in nest occurrence
   than structural measures of forest connectivity, in both 2004 and 2005.
   These results suggest that S. citrina selected nesting areas that were
   functionally connected at their preferred gap crossing distances, but
   nesting habitat was a critically important predictor of nest occurrence
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, it is hypothesized that the Golden Eagle's (Aquila
   chrysaetos) eastern population declined during the period 1946-1973
   because of organochlorine pesticides and other anthropogenic causes of
   mortality. Since 1970, upward trends for the species have been observed
   at most eastern hawkwatches. To determine whether such positive trends
   can be observed on breeding grounds, Golden Eagle counts were performed
   to monitor nesting territory occupancy between 1994 and 2007 in the
   Moisie and Sainte-Marguerite River valleys, northeastern Quebec. Aerial
   surveys were conducted during seven of the 14 years. During this period,
   the number of known nesting territories in the study area increased from
   10 to 20, while the number of pairs rose from six to 14. The increase is
   attributed mostly to investigators' improved experience in finding nests
   and to their greater familiarity with the study area, and possibly to
   the growth of the regional population. Occupancy of nesting territories
   by pairs was very stable over the years. Annual mean \% of laying pairs
   (or laying rate) was 48.0 (SD = 19.9), and productivity (mean number of
   fledglings per pair) was 0.49 (SD = 0.35).}},

Title = {{Investigating Targets of Avian Habitat Management to Eliminate an
   Ecological Trap}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ecological traps are attractive population sinks created when
   anthropogenic habitat alteration inadvertently creates a mismatch
   between the attractiveness of a habitat based upon its settlement cues,
   and its current value for survival or reproduction. Traps represent a
   new threat to the conservation of native species, yet little attention
   has been given to developing practical approaches to eliminating them.
   In the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana, Olive-sided Flycatchers
   (Contopus cooperi) prefer to settle in patches of selectively harvested
   forest versus burned forest despite the lower reproductive success and
   higher nest predation risk associated with the former habitat. I
   investigated characteristics of preferred perch sites for this species
   and how these preferences varied between habitats and sexes. I then
   built on previous research to develop a range of management
   prescriptions for reducing the attractiveness of selectively harvested
   forest, thereby disarming the ecological trap. Female flycatchers
   preferred to forage from shorter perch trees than males, and females'
   perches were shorter than other available perch trees. Both sexes
   preferred standing dead perch trees (snags) and these preferences were
   most obvious in harvested forest where snags are rarer. Because previous
   research shows that snag density is linked to habitat preference and
   spruce/fir trees are preferred nest substrate, my results suggest these
   two habitat components are focal habitat selection cues. I suggest
   alternative and complementary strategies for eliminating the ecological
   trap for Olive-sided Flycatchers including: (1) reduced retention and
   creation of snags, (2) avoiding selective harvest in spruce, fir, and
   larch stands, (3) avoiding retention of these tree species, and (4)
   selecting only even-aged canopy height trees for retention so as to
   reduce perch availability for female flycatchers. Because these
   strategies also have potential to negatively impact habitat suitability
   for other forest species or even create new ecological traps, we urge
   caution in the application of our management recommendations.}},

Title = {{Grassland Bird Responses to Three Edge Types in a Fragmented Mixed-Grass
   Prairie}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One possible factor that may have contributed to the decline of
   grassland bird populations is edge avoidance. In the mixed-grass
   prairie, habitat fragmentation is often caused by juxtaposition of
   habitats with vegetation that is structurally similar to prairie, making
   it difficult to understand why birds avoid habitat edges. We
   hypothesized that display height or resource-use strategy, i.e., the
   degree to which a species depends on grassland habitat, might explain
   variation in sensitivity to habitat edges among different species of
   grassland birds. To test our hypotheses, we used data on the abundance
   of grassland birds in native mixed-grass prairie fields in southern
   Alberta, Canada, from 2000 to 2002. Point counts were conducted up to
   4.1 km from croplands, 2.2 km from roads, and 1.8 km from wetlands. We
   used nonlinear regression models to determine the distance at which
   relative abundance of 12 bird species changed in response to edge, and
   linear regression to determine if display height or resource-use
   strategy explained variation in response to different types of edges.
   Variation in response to edge was not explained by display height or
   resource-use strategy. However, six species avoided wetland edges, two
   avoided roads, and four avoided cropland. Two species of conservation
   concern, Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) and Sprague's
   Pipits (Anthus spragueii), declined in abundance by 25\% or more within
   1.95 km and 0.91 km, respectively, of cropland edges. Because
   Chestnut-collared Longspurs avoided croplands to at least 1.95 km, it
   will be important to prevent further fragmentation of mixed-grass
   prairies by agriculture.}},

   Incubation Drives Annual Mortality}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The effort expended on reproduction may entail future costs, such as
   reduced survival or fecundity, and these costs can have an important
   influence on life-history optimization. For birds with precocial
   offspring, hypothesized costs of reproduction have typically emphasized
   nutritional and energetic investments in egg formation and incubation.
   We measured seasonal survival of 3856 radio-marked female Mallards (Anas
   platyrhynchos) from arrival on the breeding grounds through
   brood-rearing or cessation of breeding. There was a 2.5-fold direct
   increase in mortality risk associated with incubating nests in
   terrestrial habitats, whereas during brood-rearing when breeding females
   occupy aquatic habitats, mortality risk reached seasonal lows. Mortality
   risk also varied with calendar date and was highest during periods when
   large numbers of Mallards were nesting, suggesting that prey-switching
   behaviors by common predators may exacerbate risks to adults in all
   breeding stages. Although prior investments in egg laying and incubation
   affected mortality risk, most relationships were not consistent with the
   cost of reproduction hypothesis; birds with extensive prior investments
   in egg production or incubation typically survived better, suggesting
   that variation in individual quality drove both relationships. We
   conclude that for breeding female Mallards, the primary cost of
   reproduction is a fixed cost associated with placing oneself at risk to
   predators while incubating nests in terrestrial habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relative influence of environmental variables,
   especially climate, in driving variation in species diversity is
   becoming increasingly important for the conservation of biodiversity.
   The objective of this study was to determine to what extent climate can
   explain the structure and diversity of forest bird communities by
   sampling bird abundance in homogenous mature spruce stands in the boreal
   forest of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula using variance partitioning
   techniques. We also quantified the relationship among two climatic
   gradients, summer temperature and precipitation, and bird species
   richness, migratory strategy, and spring arrival phenology. For the bird
   community, climate factors appear to be most important in explaining
   species distribution and abundance because nearly 15\% of the variation
   in the distribution of the 44 breeding birds selected for the analysis
   can be explained by climate. The vegetation variables we selected were
   responsible for a much smaller amount of the explained variation (4\%).
   Breeding season temperature seems to be more important than
   precipitation in driving variation in bird species diversity at the
   scale of our analysis. Partial correlation analysis indicated that bird
   species richness distribution was determined by the temperature
   gradient, because the number of species increased with increasing
   breeding season temperature. Similar results were observed between
   breeding season temperature and the number of residents, short-distance
   and long-distance migrants, and early and late spring migrants. Our
   results suggest that the northern and southern range boundaries of
   species are not equally sensitive to the temperature gradient across the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Native grasslands have been altered to a greater extent than any other
   biome in North America. The habitats and resources needed to support
   breeding performance of grassland birds endemic to prairie ecosystems
   are currently threatened by land management practices and impending
   climate change. Climate models for the Great Plains prairie region
   predict a future of hotter and drier summers with strong multiyear
   droughts and more frequent and severe precipitation events. We examined
   how fluctuations in weather conditions in eastern Colorado influenced
   nest survival of an avian species that has experienced recent population
   declines, the Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus). Nest survival
   averaged 27.2\% over a 7-yr period (n = 936 nests) and declined as the
   breeding season progressed. Nest survival was favored by dry conditions
   and cooler temperatures. Projected changes in regional precipitation
   patterns will likely influence nest survival, with positive influences
   of predicted declines in summer rainfall yet negative effects of more
   intense rain events. The interplay of climate change and land use
   practices within prairie ecosystems may result in Mountain Plovers
   shifting their distribution, changing local abundance, and adjusting
   fecundity to adapt to their changing environment.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Increases in Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens) populations and large-scale
   habitat changes in North America have contributed to the concentration
   of migratory waterfowl on fewer wetlands, reducing resource
   availability, and enhancing risks of disease transmission. Predicting
   wintering locations of migratory individuals is critical to guide
   wildlife population management and habitat restoration. We used stable
   carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and hydrogen (delta H-2)
   isotope ratios in muscle tissue of wintering Snow Geese to discriminate
   four major wintering areas, the Playa Lake Region, Texas Gulf Coast,
   Louisiana Gulf Coast, and Arkansas, and infer the wintering locations of
   individuals collected later during the 2007 and 2008 spring migrations
   in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) of Nebraska. We predicted the wintering
   ground derivation of migrating Snow Geese using a likelihood-based
   approach. Our three-isotope analysis provided an efficient
   discrimination of the four wintering areas. The assignment model
   predicted that 53\% {[}95\% CI: 37-69] of our sample of Snow Geese from
   the RWB in 2007 had most likely originated in Louisiana, 38\% {[}23-54]
   had wintered on Texas Gulf Coast, and 9\% {[}0-20] in Arkansas; the
   assessment suggested that 89\% {[}73-100] of our 2008 sample had most
   likely come from Texas Gulf Coast, 9\% {[}0-27] from Louisiana Gulf
   Coast, and 2\% {[}0-9] from Arkansas. Further segregation of wintering
   grounds and additional sampling of spring migrating Snow Geese would
   refine overall assignment and help explain interannual variations in
   migratory connectivity. The ability to distinguish origins of northbound
   geese can support the development of spatially-adaptive management
   strategies for the midcontinent Snow Goose population. Establishing
   migratory connectivity using isotope assignment techniques can be
   extended to other waterfowl species to determine critical habitat,
   evaluate population energy requirements, and inform waterfowl
   conservation and management strategies.}},

Title = {{Avian Assemblages Differ between Old-Growth and Mature White Pine
   Forests of Ontario, Canada: A Role for Supercanopy Trees?}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{We predicted that bird diversity and abundance of some bird species
   would be higher in old-growth stands than in mature pine stands because
   of the greater structural diversity in old growth. We also predicted
   that patch size of stands should be influential. To test these
   predictions, we modeled counts of 79 bird species from 52 stands in 5
   regions in the province of Ontario, Canada in relation to habitat at the
   local and landscape extents. Neither total species richness nor
   abundance differed between stand types. No significant difference was
   found in bird assemblages between stand types using ordination analysis.
   However, more Neotropical migrants were found in old-growth stands than
   in mature stands, while the reverse was true for short-distance
   migrants. Twenty-five species had higher counts in old-growth
   stands-three significantly so: Brown Creeper Certhia americana, Northern
   Parula Setophaga americana, and Scarlet Tanager Piranga olivacea.
   Supercanopy pine (> 60 cm dbh) was a significant (P < 0.05) positive
   predictor for Black-throated Green Warbler Setophaga virens, Northern
   Parula, and total species richness, while medium/large pine (> 40
   cm/dbh) was a significant positive predictor for Brown Creeper, Pine
   Warbler Setophaga pinus, and total species richness. The density of
   supercanopy and medium/large pine explained a small but significant
   amount of variation in bird assemblages (1\%), after considering age,
   other tree variables (9\%), and landscape metrics. Patch size was
   significant for Evening Grosbeak Coccothraustes vespertinus and total
   abundance. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   thresholds, Brown Creeper required a minimum of 62 stems/ha of
   medium/large pine. Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus and
   Black-throated Green Warbler required a minimum of 14 and 23 stems/ha of
   supercanopy pine, respectively. Blackburnian Warbler Setophaga fusca
   required a minimum stand age of 66 years. Current targets in shelterwood
   seed cuts for pine appear to be just within range for Brown Creeper-at
   least for the first cut, but not for subsequent cuts. We recommend that
   forest management seek to emulate increased old-growth characteristics
   in a proportion of managed stands that fall within the range of
   variation expected under natural variation.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal Patterns in Nest Box Occupancy by Tree Swallows Across
   North America}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) suggest that
   populations of aerial insectivorous birds are declining, particularly in
   northeastern regions of the continent, and particularly since the
   mid-1980s. Species that use nest boxes, such as Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor), may provide researchers with large data sets that
   better reveal finer-scale geographical patterns in population trends. We
   analyzed trends in occupancy rates for ca. 40,000 Tree Swallow
   nest-box-years from 16 sites across North America. The earliest site has
   been studied intensively since 1969 and the latest site since 2004. Nest
   box occupancy rates declined significantly at five of six (83\%) sites
   east of -78 degrees W longitude, whereas occupancy rates increased
   significantly at four of ten sites (40\%) west of -78 degrees W
   longitude. Decreasing box occupancy trends from the northeast were
   broadly consistent with aspects of a previous analysis of BBS data for
   Tree Swallows, but our finding of instances of increases in other parts
   of the continent are novel. Several questions remain, particularly with
   respect to causes of these broad-scale geographic changes in population
   densities of Tree Swallows. The broad geographic patterns are consistent
   with a hypothesis of widespread changes in climate on wintering,
   migratory, or breeding areas that in turn may differentially affect
   populations of aerial insects, but other explanations are possible. It
   is also unclear whether these changes in occupancy rates reflect an
   increase or decrease in overall populations of Tree Swallows.
   Regardless, important conservation steps will be to unravel causes of
   changing populations of aerial insectivores in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Water and emergent vegetation are key features influencing nest site
   selection and success for many marsh-nesting waterbirds. Wetland
   management practices such as grazing, burning, and water-level
   manipulations directly affect these features and can influence nest
   survival. We used model selection and before-after-control-impact
   approaches to evaluate the effects of water depth and four common
   land-management practices or treatments, i.e., summer grazing, fall
   grazing, fall burning, and idle (no active treatment) on nest survival
   of American coots (Fulica americana) nesting at Grays Lake, a large
   montane wetland in southeast Idaho. The best model included the
   variables year x treatment, and quadratic functions of date, water
   depth, and nest age; height of vegetation at the nest did not improve
   the best model. However, results from the before-after-control-impact
   analysis indicate that management practices affected nest success via
   vegetation and involved interactions of hydrology, residual vegetation,
   and habitat composition. Nest success in idled fields changed little
   between pre- and post-treatment periods, whereas nest success declined
   in fields that were grazed or burned, with the most dramatic declines
   the year following treatments. The importance of water depth may be
   amplified in this wetland system because of rapid water-level withdrawal
   during the nesting season. Water and land-use values for area ranchers,
   management for nesting waterbirds, and long-term wetland function are
   important considerations in management of water levels and vegetation.}},

Title = {{A Demographic Model to Evaluate Population Declines in the Endangered
   Streaked Horned Lark}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Streaked Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata) is listed as
   endangered by the State of Washington, USA and by Canada under the
   Species at Risk Act and is also classified as a federal candidate for
   listing under the Endangered Species Act in the USA. A substantial
   portion of Streaked Horned Lark habitat has been lost or degraded, and
   range contraction has occurred in Oregon, Washington, and British
   Columbia. We estimate the vital rates (fecundity, adult and juvenile
   survival) and population growth rate (l) for Streaked Horned Larks
   breeding in Washington, USA and conduct a Life-Stage Simulation Analysis
   (LSA) to evaluate which vital rate has the greatest influence on l. We
   simulated changes in the three vital rates to examine how much they
   would need to be adjusted either independently or in concert to achieve
   a stable Streaked Horned Lark population (lambda = 1). We also evaluated
   which fecundity component (the number of fledglings per egg laid or
   renesting interval) had the greatest impact on l. The estimate of
   population growth suggests that Streaked Horned Larks in Washington are
   declining rapidly (lambda = 0.62 +/- 0.10) and that local breeding sites
   are not sustainable without immigration. The LSA results indicate that
   adult survival had the greatest influence on l, followed by juvenile
   survival and fecundity. However, increases in vital rates led to lambda
   = 1 only when adult survival was raised from 0.47 to 0.85, juvenile
   survival from 0.17 to 0.58, and fecundity from 0.91 to 3.09. Increases
   in breeding success and decreases in the renesting interval influenced
   lambda similarly; however, l did not reach 1 even when breeding success
   was raised to 100\% or renesting intervals were reduced to 1 day. Only
   when all three vital rates were increased simultaneously did lambda
   approach 1 without requiring highly unrealistic increases in each vital
   rate. We conclude that conservation activities need to target all or
   multiple vital rates to be successful. The baseline data presented here
   and subsequent efforts to manage Streaked Horned Larks will provide
   valuable information for management of other declining Horned Lark
   subspecies and other grassland songbirds across North America.}},

   Recruitment}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The population dynamics of long-lived birds are thought to be very
   sensitive to changes in adult survival. However, where natal philopatry
   is low, recruitment from the larger metapopulation may have the
   strongest effect on population growth rate even in long-lived species.
   Here, we illustrate such a situation where changes in a seabird colony
   size appeared to be the consequence of changes in recruitment. We
   studied the population dynamics of a declining colony of Ancient
   Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus) at East Limestone Island, British
   Columbia. During 1990-2010, Ancient Murrelet chicks were trapped at East
   Limestone Island while departing to sea, using a standard trapping
   method carried on throughout the departure period. Adult murrelets were
   trapped while departing from the colony during 1990-2003. Numbers of
   chicks trapped declined during 1990-1995, probably because of raccoon
   predation, increased slightly from 1995-2000 and subsequently declined
   again. Reproductive success was 30\% lower during 2000-2003 than in
   earlier years, mainly because of an increase in desertions. The
   proportion of nonbreeders among adult birds trapped at night also
   declined over the study period. Mortality of adult birds, thought to be
   mainly prebreeders, from predators more than doubled over the same
   period. Apparent adult survival of breeders remained constant during
   1991-2002 once the first year after banding was excluded, but the
   apparent survival rates in the first year after banding fell and the
   survival of birds banded as chicks to age three halved over the same
   period. A matrix model of population dynamics suggested that even during
   the early part of the study immigration from other breeding areas must
   have been substantial, supporting earlier observations that natal
   philopatry in this species is low. The general colony decline after 2000
   probably was related to diminished recruitment, as evidenced by the
   lower proportion of nonbreeders in the trapped sample. Hence the trend
   is determined by the recruitment decisions of externally reared birds,
   rather than demographic factors operating on the local breeding
   population, an unusual situation for a colonial marine bird. Because of
   the contraction in the colony it may now be subject to a level of
   predation pressure from which recovery will be impossible without some
   form of intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a threatened alcid
   that nests almost exclusively in old-growth forests along the Pacific
   coast of North America. Nesting habitat has significant economic
   importance. Murrelet nests are extremely difficult and costly to find,
   which adds uncertainty to management and conservation planning. Models
   based on air photo interpretation of forest cover maps or assessments by
   low-level helicopter flights are currently used to rank presumed Marbled
   Murrelet nesting habitat quality in British Columbia. These rankings are
   assumed to correlate with nest usage and murrelet breeding productivity.
   Our goal was to find the models that best predict Marbled Murrelet
   nesting habitat in the ground-accessible portion of the two regions
   studied. We generated Resource Selection Functions (RSF) using logistic
   regression models of ground-based forest stand variables gathered at
   plots around 64 nests, located using radio-telemetry, versus 82 random
   habitat plots. The RSF scores are proportional to the probability of
   nests occurring in a forest patch. The best models differed somewhat
   between the two regions, but include both ground variables at the patch
   scale (0.2-2.0 ha), such as platform tree density, height and trunk
   diameter of canopy trees and canopy complexity, and landscape scale
   variables such as elevation, aspect, and slope. Collecting ground-based
   habitat selection data would not be cost-effective for widespread use in
   forestry management; air photo interpretation and low-level aerial
   surveys are much more efficient methods for ranking habitat suitability
   on a landscape scale. This study provides one method for ground-truthing
   the remote methods, an essential step made possible using the numerical
   RSF scores generated herein.}},

Title = {{Identification of Putative Wintering Areas and Ecological Determinants

Abstract = {{To identify the causes of population decline in migratory birds,
   researchers must determine the relative influence of environmental
   changes on population dynamics while the birds are on breeding grounds,
   wintering grounds, and en route between the two. This is problematic
   when the wintering areas of specific populations are unknown. Here, we
   first identified the putative wintering areas of Common House-Martin
   (Delichon urbicum) and Common Swift (Apus apus) populations breeding in
   northern Italy as those areas, within the wintering ranges of these
   species, where the winter Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   which may affect winter survival, best predicted annual variation in
   population indices observed in the breeding grounds in 1992-2009. In
   these analyses, we controlled for the potentially confounding effects of
   rainfall in the breeding grounds during the previous year, which may
   affect reproductive success; the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO),
   which may account for climatic conditions faced by birds during
   migration; and the linear and squared term of year, which account for
   nonlinear population trends. The areas thus identified ranged from
   Guinea to Nigeria for the Common House-Martin, and were located in
   southern Ghana for the Common Swift. We then regressed annual population
   indices on mean NDVI values in the putative wintering areas and on the
   other variables, and used Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and
   hierarchical partitioning (HP) of variance to assess their relative
   contribution to population dynamics. We re-ran all the analyses using
   NDVI values at different spatial scales, and consistently found that our
   population of Common House-Martin was primarily affected by spring
   rainfall (43\%-47.7\% explained variance) and NDVI (24\%-26.9\%), while
   the Common Swift population was primarily affected by the NDVI
   (22.7\%-34.8\%). Although these results must be further validated,
   currently they are the only hypotheses about the wintering grounds of
   the Italian populations of these species, as no Common House-Martin and
   Common Swift ringed in Italy have been recovered in their wintering
   ranges.}},

Title = {{Demography of Female Greater Prairie-Chickens in Unfragmented Grasslands

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) have been
   declining because of loss and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie
   habitats, and management plans require contemporary demographic data.
   Our objectives were to determine whether maternal nutrition or predation
   were determinants of nesting success and female survival. We captured
   and radio-marked 43 females at four leks in natural, unfragmented
   prairie during a 4-year study. Reproductive potential was high because
   females laid large clutches (10.9 +/- 0.3 eggs, n = 24), renested
   following clutch loss (22.2\%, n = 27 females), and had high egg
   viability (88.6 +/- 5.0\% of eggs hatched; n = 7 nests), but
   reproductive traits were not correlated with female morphometrics (mass,
   or tarsus and keel lengths). Daily survival rate of nests was low
   (0.928, n = 34 nests) resulting in a predicted nest success rate of
   7.4\% for a 35-day exposure period. We used known fate models to
   estimate weekly survival from telemetry data for 40 females. Weekly
   survival was 0.970 and the extrapolated survival rate for the 6-month
   breeding season was 45.7\%. Using time-sincemarking Cormack-Jolly-Seber
   models for live encounter data to control for transience, annual
   apparent survival was 0.277 +/- 0.081 SE for 55 marked females after
   initial capture, and 0.424 +/- 0.139 during subsequent intervals.
   Survival of females was 1.6 to 2.0 times higher during the nonbreeding
   season than the breeding season, presumably because females are
   susceptible to predation during incubation and broodrearing. Predation
   of nests and females may be the main demographic factors limiting
   population viability because predation, and not maternal nutrition,
   accounted for unexpectedly low nesting success and breeding season
   survival of Greater Prairie-Chickens in natural habitats. Future
   research should investigate rangeland practices that increase residual
   nesting cover or reduce predator impacts.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the general predictions of increased use of nest boxes and
   positive trends in local populations of Common Goldeneye (Bucephala
   clangula) and Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola) following the large-scale
   provision of nest boxes in a study area of central Alberta over a
   16-year period. Nest boxes were rapidly occupied, primarily by Common
   Goldeneye and Bufflehead, but also by European Starling (Sturnus
   vulgaris). After 5 years of deployment, occupancy of large boxes by
   Common Goldeneye was 82\% to 90\% and occupancy of small boxes by
   Bufflehead was 37\% to 58\%. Based on a single-stage cluster design,
   experimental closure of nest boxes resulted in significant reductions in
   numbers of broods and brood sizes produced by Common Goldeneye and
   Bufflehead. Occurrence and densities of Common Goldeneye and Bufflehead
   increased significantly across years following nest box deployment at
   the local scale, but not at the larger regional scale. Provision of nest
   boxes may represent a viable strategy for increasing breeding
   populations of these two waterfowl species on landscapes where large
   trees and natural cavities are uncommon but wetland density is high.}},

Abstract = {{Despite declines in the grassland bird guild and increasing rates of
   natural gas extraction on the Canadian prairies, relatively few studies
   have examined the effects of well sites and related infrastructure on
   these species. We conducted point counts on Canadian Forces Base
   Suffield, Alberta to investigate the effects of two well densities
   (high: 16 wells/2.59km(2), low: 9 wells/2.59km(2)) on Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis), Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius
   ornatus), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) occurrence and
   abundance. Additionally, model building was employed to determine if
   landscape features, i.e., soil type, elevation, and topography, along
   with well density and anthropogenic disturbance to natural vegetation,
   i.e., the combined areas affected by wells, pipelines, trails, and
   roads, could predict the occurrence of the three species. For Savannah
   Sparrows, occurrence and abundance were higher in areas with high well
   densities compared with low well densities, reflecting the species'
   general tolerance of human disturbances. Chestnut-collared Longspurs
   were ubiquitous in the study area and abundance was not related to well
   density. Models for this species performed poorly and failed to predict
   occurrence accurately. Models for Sprague's Pipit were the strongest and
   showed that this species' occurrence was negatively related to
   anthropogenic disturbance. For all three species, landscape features had
   low predictive power. Our results indicate that disturbance caused by
   well sites and related infrastructure affect occurrence of some species
   and should be incorporated into conservation strategies for grassland
   birds, especially as undisturbed grasslands become candidates for energy
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Many common bird species have declined as a result of agricultural
   intensification and this could be mitigated by organic farming. We
   paired sites for habitat and geographical location on organic and
   nonorganic farms in Ontario, Canada to test a priori predictions of
   effects on birds overall, 9 guilds and 22 species in relation to
   candidate models for farming practices (13 variables), local habitat
   features (12 variables), or habitat features that influence
   susceptibility to predation. We found that: (1) Overall bird abundance,
   but not richness, was significantly (p < 0.05) higher on organic sites
   (mean 43.1 individuals per site) than nonorganic sites (35.8 individuals
   per site). Significantly more species of birds were observed for five
   guilds, including primary grassland birds, on organic vs. nonorganic
   sites. No guild had higher richness or abundance on nonorganic farms;
   (2) Farming practice models were the best (Delta AIC < 4) for abundance
   of birds overall, primary grassland bird richness, sallier aerial
   insectivore richness and abundance, and abundance of ground nesters; (3)
   Habitat models were the best for overall richness, Neotropical migrant
   abundance, richness and abundance of Ontario-USA-Mexico (short-distance)
   migrants and resident richness; (4) Predation models were the best for
   richness of secondary grassland birds and ground feeders; (5) A
   combination of variables from the model types were best for richness or
   abundance overall, 13 of 18 guilds (richness and abundance) and 16 of 22
   species analyzed. Five of 10 farming practice variables (including
   herbicide use, organic farm type) and 9 of 13 habitat variables
   (including hedgerow length, proportion of hay) were significant in best
   models. Risk modeling indicated that herbicide use could decrease
   primary grassland birds by one species (35\% decline from 3.4 to 2.3
   species) per site. Organic farming could benefit species of conservation
   concern by 49\% (an increase from 7.6 to 11.4 grassland birds). An
   addition of 63 m of hedgerow could increase abundance and richness of
   short distance migrants by 50\% (3.0 to 4.8 and 1.3 to 2.0,
   respectively). Increasing the proportion of hay on nonorganic farms to
   50\% could increase abundance of primary grassland bird by 40\% (6.7 to
   9.4). Our results provide support for alternative farmland designs and
   agricultural management systems that could enhance select bird species
   in farmland.}},

Title = {{Modeling Habitat Associations for the Common Loon (Gavia immer) at
   Multiple Scales in Northeastern North America}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Common Loon (Gavia immer) is considered an emblematic and ecologically
   important example of aquatic-dependent wildlife in North America. The
   northern breeding range of Common Loon has contracted over the last
   century as a result of habitat degradation from human disturbance and
   lakeshore development. We focused on the state of New Hampshire, USA,
   where a long-term monitoring program conducted by the Loon Preservation
   Committee has been collecting biological data on Common Loon since 1976.
   The Common Loon population in New Hampshire is distributed throughout
   the state across a wide range of lake-specific habitats, water quality
   conditions, and levels of human disturbance. We used a multiscale
   approach to evaluate the association of Common Loon and breeding habitat
   within three natural physiographic ecoregions of New Hampshire. These
   multiple scales reflect Common Loon-specific extents such as
   territories, home ranges, and lake-landscape influences. We developed
   ecoregional multiscale models and compared them to single-scale models
   to evaluate model performance in distinguishing Common Loon breeding
   habitat. Based on information-theoretic criteria, there is empirical
   support for both multiscale and single-scale models across all three
   ecoregions, warranting a model-averaging approach. Our results suggest
   that the Common Loon responds to both ecological and anthropogenic
   factors at multiple scales when selecting breeding sites. These
   multiscale models can be used to identify and prioritize the
   conservation of preferred nesting habitat for Common Loon populations.}},

Title = {{Linking Canadian Harvested Juvenile American Black Ducks to Their Natal
   Areas Using Stable Isotope (delta D, delta 13C, and delta 15N) Methods}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Understanding source-sink dynamics of game birds is essential to harvest
   and habitat management but acquiring this information is often
   logistically and financially challenging using traditional methods of
   population surveys and banding studies. This is especially true for
   species such as the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), which have low
   breeding densities and extensive breeding ranges that necessitate
   extensive surveys and banding programs across eastern North America.
   Despite this effort, the contribution of birds fledged from various
   landscapes and habitat types within specific breeding ranges to regional
   harvest is largely unknown but remains an important consideration in
   adaptive harvest management and targeted habitat conservation
   strategies. We investigated if stable isotope (delta D, delta 13C, delta
   15N) could augment our present understanding of connectivity between
   breeding and harvest areas and so provide information relevant to the
   two main management strategies for black ducks, harvest and habitat
   management. We obtained specimens from 200 hatch-year Black Duck wings
   submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Service Species Composition Survey.
   Samples were obtained from birds harvested in Western, Central, and
   Eastern breeding/harvest subregions to provide a sample representative
   of the range and harvest rate of birds harvested in Canada. We sampled
   only hatch-year birds to provide an unambiguous and direct link between
   production and harvest areas. Marine origins were assigned to 12\%, 7\%,
   and 5\% of birds harvested in the Eastern, Central, and Western
   subregions, respectively. In contrast, 32\%, 9\%, and 5\% of birds were
   assigned, respectively, to agricultural origins. All remaining birds
   were assigned to nonagricultural origins. We portrayed probability of
   origin using a combination of Bayesian statistical and GIS methods.
   Placement of most eastern birds was western Nova Scotia, eastern New
   Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and southern Newfoundland. Agricultural
   birds from the Central region were consistent with the Saguenay region
   of Quebec and the eastern claybelt with nonagricultural birds
   originating in the boreal. Western nonagricultural birds were associated
   with broad boreal origins from southern James Bay to Lake of the Woods
   and east to Cochrane, Ontario. Our work shows that the geographic
   origins, landscape, and habitat associations of hatch-year Black Ducks
   can be inferred using this technique and we recommend that a broad-scale
   isotopic study using a large sample of Canadian and US harvested birds
   be implemented to provide a continental perspective of source-sink
   population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Human development is increasing pressure on North America's mainly
   intact boreal forest. We outline the need for a comprehensive synthesis
   of existing data and for effective scientific tools to support
   conservation of this biome and of the birds that depend on it. To
   illustrate how broad collaborations can address these needs, we
   introduce and report on the Boreal Avian Modelling Project. This is a
   new partnership involving universities, government, private, and
   nongovernment groups that was created to develop spatially explicit,
   predictive models of boreal bird habitat associations across Canada.
   This initiative is designed to improve our understanding of the
   influence of environmental factors and human activities on boreal bird
   species, leading to spatially explicit predictive models of the
   distribution of avian populations. The intended applications of these
   models are land use planning and avian conservation across the nearctic
   boreal forest. In this essay, we present a description of the extensive
   collection of point count survey data assembled by the Project, and the
   library of spatial covariates used for modeling. We show how it is
   possible to account for a number of nuisance variables related to
   differences in survey protocol among source data sets and make some
   preliminary suggestions as to how future surveys could be standardized.
   We present a distance-sampling approach used to convert standardized
   point count data to density estimates, which we illustrate by providing
   habitat-specific densities and total population estimates for one
   species in a part of western Canada. We also illustrate the use of
   Classification and Regression Trees to develop species niche models from
   the standardized data. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a
   monitoring program for boreal birds in Canada, the role of predictive
   statistical models in developing such a program, and how monitoring
   could be related to boreal bird conservation through adaptive
   management.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relationship between climatic factors and the
   distribution of breeding birds in southern Quebec, Canada to identify
   the species whose distribution renders them potentially sensitive to
   climate change in the study area. We determined the degree of
   association between the distribution of 65 breeding bird species (601
   presence-absence squares of the Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Quebec)
   and climate variables (212 climatological stations in operation for at
   least 20 years over the period 1953-1984) by statistically correcting
   for the effects of several factors that are correlated with bird
   distribution. Factors considered were the nature and scale of land cover
   patterns that included vegetation types and landscape characterization,
   geographical coordinates, and elevation. Canonical Correspondence
   Analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the effect of climatic variables
   on breeding bird distribution. Independent variables accounted for a
   total of 29.1\% of the variation in the species matrix. A very large
   portion of the variance explained by climate variables was shared with
   spatial variables, reflecting the relationships among latitude,
   longitude, elevation, and climate. After correcting for the effect of
   land cover variables, climatic variables still explained 11.4\% of the
   variation in the species matrix, with temperature, i.e., warmer summers
   and milder winters, having a greater influence than precipitation, i.e.,
   wetter summers. Of the 65 species, 14 appeared to be particularly
   climate-sensitive. Eight are insectivorous neotropical migrants and six
   species are at the northern limit of their range in the study area. The
   opposite is largely true for the eight others; they are practically
   absent from the southern part of the study area, except for the
   Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), which is widespread there. The
   White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) is the only resident
   species that seemed responsive to climatic variables, i.e., milder
   winters. Climate warming is thus likely to induce northward shifts for
   several neotropical migrant species. Many species that currently breed
   in the northern portion of eastern United States are likely to move
   northward into Canada. It is thus crucial that sufficient habitats be
   preserved in Canada to accommodate these future ``climate refugees.{''}
   Forests in the study area are under management for lumber and therefore,
   their conservation should receive particular attention.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the reproductive consequences of differential nest site use
   in Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma furcata) in the Aleutian
   Islands, Alaska, where birds on islands where foxes were introduced nest
   in rocky substrate rather than in typical soil habitat. We investigated
   how physical and microclimatic nest site characteristics influenced
   storm-petrel breeding success 20 years after fox removal. We then
   examined whether those nest site characteristics that affected success
   were related to the amount of rock that composed the nest. In both years
   of our study, nest temperature had the strongest influence on chick
   survival and overall reproductive success, appearing in all the top
   models and alone explaining 14-35\% of the variation in chick survival.
   The relationship between reproductive success and nest temperature was
   positive in both years, with higher survival in warmer nests. In turn,
   the best predictor of nest temperature was the amount of rock that
   composed the site. Rockier nests had colder average temperatures, which
   were driven by lower daily minimum temperatures, compared to nests with
   more soil. Thus, the rockiness of the nest site appeared to affect chick
   survival and overall reproductive success through its influence on nest
   temperature. This study suggests that the use of rocky nest sites,
   presumed to be a result of historic predation from introduced foxes,
   could decrease breeding success in this recovering population, and thus
   be a long-lasting effect of introduced predators.}},

Abstract = {{North American birds that feed on aerial insects are experiencing
   widespread population declines. An analysis of the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey trend estimates for 1966 to 2006 suggests that
   declines in this guild are significantly stronger than in passerines in
   general. The pattern of decline also shows a striking geographical
   gradient, with aerial insectivore declines becoming more prevalent
   towards the northeast of North America. Declines are also more acute in
   species that migrate long distances compared to those that migrate short
   distances. The declines become manifest, almost without exception, in
   the mid 1980s. The taxonomic breadth of these downward trends suggests
   that declines in aerial insectivore populations are linked to changes in
   populations of flying insects, and these changes might be indicative of
   underlying ecosystem changes.}},

Abstract = {{We compared habitat features of Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora
   chrysoptera) territories in the presence and absence of the Blue-winged
   Warbler (V. cyanoptera) on reclaimed coal mines in southeastern
   Kentucky, USA. Our objective was to determine whether there are species
   specific differences in habitat that can be manipulated to encourage
   population persistence of the Golden-winged Warbler. When compared with
   Blue-winged Warblers, Golden-winged Warblers established territories at
   higher elevations and with greater percentages of grass and canopy
   cover. Mean territory size (minimum convex polygon) was 1.3 ha (se =
   0.1) for Golden-winged Warbler in absence of Blue-winged Warbler, 1.7 ha
   (se = 0.3) for Golden-winged Warbler coexisting with Blue-winged
   Warbler, and 2.1 ha (se = 0.3) for Blue-winged Warbler. Territory
   overlap occurred within and between species (18 of n = 73 territories,
   24.7\%). All Golden-winged and Blue-winged Warblers established
   territories that included an edge between reclaimed mine land and mature
   forest, as opposed to establishing territories in open
   grassland/shrubland habitat. The mean distance territories extended from
   a forest edge was 28.0 m (se = 3.8) for Golden-winged Warbler in absence
   of Blue-winged Warbler, 44.7 m (se = 5.7) for Golden-winged Warbler
   coexisting with Blue-winged Warbler, and 33.1 m (se = 6.1) for
   Blue-winged Warbler. Neither territory size nor distances to forest
   edges differed significantly between Golden-winged Warbler in presence
   or absence of Blue-winged Warbler. According to Monte Carlo analyses,
   orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica)
   seedlings and saplings, and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) saplings
   were indicative of sites with only Golden-winged Warblers. Sericea
   lespedeza, goldenrod (Solidago spp.), clematis vine (Clematis spp.), and
   blackberry (Rubus spp.) were indicative of sites where both species
   occurred. Our findings complement recent genetic studies and add another
   factor for examining Golden-winged Warbler population decline. Further,
   information from our study will aid land managers in manipulating
   habitat for the Golden-winged Warbler.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, many early-succession songbird species have
   experienced severe and widespread declines, which often are related to
   habitat destruction. Field borders create additional or enhance existing
   early-succession habitat on farmland. However, field border shape and
   the landscape context surrounding farms may influence the effectiveness
   of field borders in contributing to the stabilization or increase of
   early-succession bird populations. We examined the influence of linear
   and nonlinear field borders on farms in landscapes dominated by either
   agriculture or forests on nest success and Brown-headed Cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) brood parasitism of Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea)
   and Blue Grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) nests combined. Field border
   establishment did not affect nest survival probability and brood
   parasitism frequency of Indigo Bunting and Blue Grosbeak nests. Indigo
   Bunting/Blue Grosbeak nest success probability was more than twice as
   high in agriculture-dominated landscapes (39\%) than in forested
   landscapes (17\%), and brood parasitism frequency was high (33\%) but
   did not differ between landscapes. Edges in agriculture-dominated
   landscapes can be higher-quality habitats for early-succession birds
   than edges in forest-dominated landscapes, but our field border
   treatments did not enhance nest success for these birds on farms in
   either landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The increased pace of species listing worldwide, coupled with the
   scarcity of conservation funding, promote the use of targeted
   monitoring. We applied the recommendations of Nichols and Williams
   (Trends in Ecology and Evolution 2006 24: 668-673) to optimize the
   Quebec Chimney Swift Monitoring Program, an ongoing volunteer-based
   monitoring initiative launched in 1998. Past objectives of the program
   were to fill knowledge gaps about occupancy patterns at roosts sites,
   determine spatial and temporal distribution of Chimney Swifts (Chaetura
   pelagica) across the province, locate active nest sites, and monitor
   temporal fluctuations of the population. By applying an adaptive
   management framework, we modified the current monitoring scheme into a
   more focused initiative testing newly developed hypotheses about the
   state of the system. This new approach yielded significant scientific
   gains as well as annual savings of 19.6\%. It may prove pertinent to
   current and future swift monitoring initiatives and to other aerial
   insectivore species.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of
   contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities
   such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples
   of ``citizen science{''} projects. With the advent of technology, Web
   2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing
   of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring.
   However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and
   elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses.
   Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a
   hypothetico-deductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of
   citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues
   of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data
   collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the
   literature from social geography on the concept of ``citizen sensors{''}
   and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful
   reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when
   applying information from citizen sensors to research and management
   questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for
   environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that
   conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the
   scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how
   principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects
   to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for
   how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental
   controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization
   and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability
   and statistical power.}},

Abstract = {{Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are listed as endangered throughout
   Canada and the United States Great Lakes region. Most attempts to
   increase their numbers have focused on enhancing reproductive success.
   Using 22 years of data collected by Parks Canada in Prince Edward Island
   National Park of Canada, we examined whether predator exclosures
   installed around Piping Plover nests increased nest success and hatching
   and fledging success when compared to nests without exclosures. Nests
   with exclosures were significantly more likely to hatch at least one egg
   than nests without exclosures, and they hatched a significantly greater
   number of young. The greater reproductive success observed in exclosed
   nests is likely due to the increased protection from predators that the
   exclosures conferred; significantly fewer exclosed nests were depredated
   than nonexclosed nests. However, significantly more exclosed than
   nonexclosed nests were abandoned by adults, and they had significantly
   greater adult mortality. Whether benefits of increased reproductive
   success from exclosures outweigh costs of increased abandonment and
   adult mortality remains unknown, but must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Declining grassland breeding bird populations have led to increased
   efforts to assess habitat quality, typically by estimating density or
   relative abundance. Because some grassland habitats may function as
   ecological traps, a more appropriate metric for determining quality may
   be breeding success. Between 1994 and 2003 we gathered data on the nest
   fates of Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx
   oryzivorous), and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) in a
   series of fallow fields and pastures/hayfields in western New York
   State. We calculated daily survival probabilities using the Mayfield
   method, and used the logistic-exposure method to model effects of
   predictor variables on nest success. Nest survival probabilities were
   0.464 for Eastern Meadowlarks (n = 26), 0.483 for Bobolinks (n = 91),
   and 0.585 for Savannah Sparrows (n = 152). Fledge dates for first
   clutches ranged between 14 June and 23 July. Only one obligate grassland
   bird nest was parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), for
   an overall brood parasitism rate of 0.004. Logistic-exposure models
   indicated that daily nest survival probabilities were higher in
   pastures/hayfields than in fallow fields. Our results, and those from
   other studies in the Northeast, suggest that properly managed cool
   season grassland habitats in the region may not act as ecological traps,
   and that obligate grassland birds in the region may have greater nest
   survival probabilities, and lower rates of Brown-headed Cowbird
   parasitism, than in many parts of the Midwest.}},

Abstract = {{In the northeastern United States, grassland birds regularly use
   agricultural fields as nesting habitat. However, birds that nest in
   these fields regularly experience nest failure as a result of
   agricultural practices, such as mowing and grazing. Therefore,
   information on both spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use is
   needed to effectively manage these species. We addressed these complex
   habitat use patterns by conducting point counts during three time
   intervals between May 21, 2002 and July 2, 2002 in agricultural fields
   across the Champlain Valley in Vermont and New York. Early in the
   breeding season, Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) used fields in which
   the landscape within 2500 m was dominated by open habitats. As mowing
   began, suitable habitat within 500 m became more important. Savannah
   Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) initially used fields that
   contained a high proportion of suitable habitat within 500 m. After
   mowing, features of the field (i.e., size and amount of woody edge)
   became more important. Each species responded differently to mowing:
   Savannah Sparrows were equally abundant in mowed and uncut fields,
   whereas Bobolinks were more abundant in uncut fields. In agricultural
   areas in the Northeast, large areas (2000 ha) that are mostly
   nonforested and undeveloped should be targeted for conservation. Within
   large open areas, smaller patches (80 ha) should be maintained as
   high-quality, late-cut grassland habitat.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Conservation planning requires identifying pertinent habitat factors and
   locating geographic locations where land management may improve habitat
   conditions for high priority species. I derived habitat models and
   mapped predicted abundance for the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora
   chrysoptera), a species of high conservation concern, using bird counts,
   environmental variables, and hierarchical models applied at multiple
   spatial scales. My aim was to understand habitat associations at
   multiple spatial scales and create a predictive abundance map for
   purposes of conservation planning for the Golden-winged Warbler. My
   models indicated a substantial influence of landscape conditions,
   including strong positive associations with total forest composition
   within the landscape. However, many of the associations I observed were
   counter to reported associations at finer spatial extents; for instance,
   I found Golden-winged Warblers negatively associated with several
   measures of edge habitat. No single spatial scale dominated, indicating
   that this species is responding to factors at multiple spatial scales. I
   found Golden-winged Warbler abundance was negatively related with
   Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) abundance. I also observed a
   north-south spatial trend suggestive of a regional climate effect that
   was not previously noted for this species. The map of predicted
   abundance indicated a large area of concentrated abundance in
   west-central Wisconsin, with smaller areas of high abundance along the
   northern periphery of the Prairie Hardwood Transition. This map of
   predicted abundance compared favorably with independent evaluation data
   sets and can thus be used to inform regional planning efforts devoted to
   conserving this species.}},

Title = {{Contrasting Seasonal Survivorship of Two Migratory Songbirds Wintering
   in Threatened Mangrove Forests}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Long-distance migrants wintering in tropical regions face a number of
   critical conservation threats throughout their lives, but seasonal
   estimates of key demographic parameters such as winter survival are
   rare. Using mist-netting-based mark-recapture data collected in coastal
   Costa Rica over a six-year period, we examined variation in within-and
   between-winter survivorship of the Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria
   citrea; 753 young and 376 adults banded), a declining neotropical
   habitat specialist that depends on threatened mangrove forests during
   the nonbreeding season. We derived parallel seasonal survivorship
   estimates for the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis; 564
   young and 93 adults banded), a cohabitant mangrove specialist that has
   not shown the same population decline in North America, to assess
   whether contrasting survivorship might contribute to the observed
   differences in the species' population trajectories. Although average
   annual survival probability was relatively similar between the two
   species for both young and adult birds, monthly estimates indicated that
   relative to Northern Waterthrush, Prothonotary Warblers exhibited:
   greater interannual variation in survivorship, especially within
   winters; greater variation in survivorship among the three study sites;
   lower average between-winter survivorship, particularly among females,
   and; a sharp decline in between-winter survivorship from 2003 to 2009
   for both age groups and both sexes. Rather than identifying one seasonal
   vital rate as a causal factor of Prothonotary Warbler population
   declines, our species comparison suggests that the combination of
   variable within-winter survival with decreasing between-winter survival
   demands a multi-seasonal approach to the conservation of this and other
   tropical-wintering migrants.}},

Abstract = {{Effective conservation measures should target the most sensitive life
   history attributes of a species, assuming they are responsive to
   potential management actions. The Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus)
   is a species of conservation concern with a patchy breeding distribution
   in western North America. Plovers prefer areas with short vegetation,
   bare ground, and disturbance for nesting. Current management tools,
   including grazing and burning, have been used to attract plovers and
   enhance nesting success. We used a stage-specific matrix model to study
   the influence of vital rates, e. g., juvenile and adult annual survival,
   on population growth rate in the Mountain Plover at two breeding sites
   in Colorado, South Park and Eastern Colorado, and one breeding site in
   Montana, USA. Our analysis was motivated by a need to 1) better
   understand the relationship between demographic rates and population
   growth rate, 2) assess current management tools for the plover by
   exploring their effect on population growth rate, and 3) identify areas
   of the plover's population biology where additional demographic work is
   needed. Stochastic population growth rate was most influenced by adult
   survival, especially in Montana and South Park, Colorado (elasticities
   >0.60), and was least influenced by first-year reproduction (all
   elasticities <0.20). The modeled relationships between lambda and each
   demographic rate were generally weak (r(2) < 0.30) with the exception of
   number of eggs hatched per nest in Eastern Colorado (r(2) = 0.63), chick
   survival in South Park (r(2) = 0.40) and Montana (r(2) = 0.38), and
   adult survival in Montana (r(2) = 0.36). We examined the predicted
   increase in lambda that would result from increasing each demographic
   rate from its mean to the maximum value observed in our simulations.
   Chick and adult survival showed the greatest increase in lambda while
   eggs hatched per nest produced the smallest increase. Our results
   suggest that future conservation efforts should favor ways to increase
   adult or chick survival over efforts to increase nest success. In
   particular, adult survival rates during the stationary periods, i.e.,
   summer and winter, are relatively high, implying that efforts to
   increase adult survival rates may need to focus on the migratory
   periods. Increasing chick survival should be a priority for efforts that
   are restricted to the breeding grounds because this life history stage
   is relatively short (< 3 mo) and it offers opportunities for targeted
   short-term management activities in breeding areas.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring, management, and conservation of grassland birds are topics
   of importance because of widespread population declines. Annual
   estimates of survival are available for many species, however knowledge
   of how survival varies on a seasonal basis remains poor. Information on
   the relative effects of breeding, overwintering, and migratory periods
   on population dynamics is necessary for effective management. Mortality
   risks often vary with the stage of the breeding cycle. In precocial
   species, mortality risks of adult birds are often higher during
   post-hatching care than prehatching. Using a multistate modeling
   approach, I investigated the influence of both environmental
   characteristics, measured by habitat, and individual characteristics,
   measured by sex and body mass, on post-hatching parental mortality of a
   declining grassland species, the Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus).
   I found minimal evidence to support the effect of habitat, sex, or body
   mass on post-hatching parental mortality. Daily parental mortality was
   0.0037 (SE = 0.0007, CI = 0.0026, 0.0053) and survival during the 30-day
   post-hatching period was 0.8943 (SE = 0.0187, CI = 0.8512, 0.9255). The
   findings from this study provide an understanding of the associations
   with today's grassland habitats and the dynamics of Mountain Plovers
   during the breeding season. Prior to assessing if alterations in
   habitats are acting more on post-hatching than the other stages of the
   annual cycle for the Mountain Plover, information on survival during
   other breeding stages and during migration is needed to assist in
   developing effective conservation and management plans.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing in the shortgrass steppe of the Intermountain region
   of British Columbia is predicted to have significant effects on
   grassland habitats and their associated ground-nesting bird communities.
   We tested whether grazed and ungrazed sites could be discriminated on
   the basis of their vegetation communities, whether the abundance of two
   ground-nesting bird species, Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) and
   Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), differed between grazed and
   ungrazed sites, and whether vegetation variables found to differ between
   grazed and ungrazed plots could be used to predict the abundance of the
   two bird species at a fine scale. Grazed sites were easily
   distinguishable from a site that had been ungrazed for >30 years based
   on the structure and composition of their vegetation communities.
   However, more detailed grazing categories could not be distinguished on
   the basis of vegetation characteristics. Despite the existence of
   grazing effects on vegetation structure and composition, we found no
   consistent differences in abundance of Vesper Sparrows and Western
   Meadowlarks between the grazed and ungrazed sites. However, there was
   weak evidence that the abundance of both species was higher at
   fine-scale plots (100 m radius point count station) with less bare
   ground and taller vegetation. Bare ground cover was lower on grazed
   plots, but vegetation was taller on ungrazed plots. Combined, our
   results suggest that low intensity grazing leads to grassland habitat
   change with both negative and positive effects on Vesper Sparrows and
   Western Meadowlarks, resulting in no net change in their broad-scale
   abundance.}},

Title = {{Separation of Availability and Perception Processes for Aural Detection
   in Avian Point Counts: a Combined Multiple-Observer and
   Time-of-Detection Approach}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we review various methods of estimating detection
   probabilities for avian point counts: distance sampling, multiple
   observer methods, and recently proposed time-of-detection methods. Both
   distance and multiple observer methods require the sometimes unrealistic
   assumption that all birds in the population sing during the count
   interval. We provide a general model of detection where the total
   probability of detection is made up of the probability of a bird
   singing, i.e., availability, and the probability of detecting a bird,
   conditional on its having sung. We show that the time-of-detection
   method provides an estimate of the total probability, whereas combining
   the time-of-detection method with a multiple observer method enables
   estimation of the two components of the detection process separately.
   Our approach is shown to be a special case of Pollock's robust
   capture-recapture design where the probability that a bird does not sing
   is equivalent to the probability that an animal is a temporary emigrant.
   We estimate Hooded Warbler and Ovenbird population size, through maximum
   likelihood estimation, using experimentally simulated field data for
   which the true population sizes were known. The method performs well
   when singing rates and detection probabilities are high, and when
   observers are able to accurately localize individual birds. Population
   sizes are underestimated when there is heterogeneity of singing rates
   among individual birds, especially when singing rates are close to zero.
   Despite the additional expense and the potential for counting and
   matching errors, we encourage field ornithologists to consider using
   this combined method in their field studies to better understand the
   detection process, and to obtain better abundance estimates.}},

Title = {{Nonbreeding-Season Drivers of Population Dynamics in Seasonal Migrants:
   Conservation Parallels Across Taxa}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For seasonal migrants, logistical constraints have often limited
   conservation efforts to improving survival and reproduction during the
   breeding season only. Yet, mounting empirical evidence suggests that
   events occurring throughout the migratory life cycle can critically
   alter the demography of many migrant species. Herein, we build upon
   recent syntheses of avian migration research to review the role of
   non-breeding seasons in determining the population dynamics and fitness
   of diverse migratory taxa, including salmonid fishes, marine mammals,
   ungulates, sea turtles, butterflies, and numerous bird groups. We
   discuss several similarities across these varied migrants: (i)
   non-breeding survivorship tends to be a strong driver of population
   growth; (ii) non-breeding events can affect fitness in subsequent
   seasons through seasonal interactions at individual-and
   population-levels; (iii) broad-scale climatic influences often alter
   non-breeding resources and migration timing, and may amplify population
   impacts through covariation among seasonal vital rates; and (iv) changes
   to both stationary and migratory non-breeding habitats can have
   important consequences for abundance and population trends. Finally, we
   draw on these patterns to recommend that future conservation research
   for seasonal migrants will benefit from: (1) more explicit recognition
   of the important parallels among taxonomically diverse migratory
   animals; (2) an expanded research perspective focused on quantification
   of all seasonal vital rates and their interactions; and (3) the
   development of detailed population projection models that account for
   complexity and uncertainty in migrant population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Salt marshes constitute habitat islands for many endemic animal species,
   particularly along the California coast, where urban sprawl has
   fragmented this habitat. Recreational activities in salt marshes have
   increased recently, posing an interesting problem: how do endemic
   species lacking alternative habitat modify their tolerance to humans? We
   assessed seasonal and site variations in three tolerance parameters
   (distances at which animals became alert, fled, and moved after fleeing)
   of California's endangered Belding's Savannah Sparrow ((Passerculus
   sandwichensis beldingi). We approached individuals on trails in three
   salt marshes with different levels of vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
   Belding's Savannah Sparrows became aware and fled at shorter distances
   in the salt marsh coincident with greater levels of recreational
   activity as a result of habituation or visual obstruction effects.
   Seasonal effects in tolerance varied between sites. Alert and flight
   initiation distances were higher in the pre-nesting than in the
   non-breeding season in the site with the highest levels of recreational
   use likely due to greater exposure of breeding individuals; however, the
   opposite seasonal trend was found in each of the two sites with
   relatively lower human use, probably because individuals were less
   spatially attached in the non-breeding season when they foraged in
   aggregations. Distance fled was greater in the non-breeding than in the
   breeding season. Our findings call for dynamic management of
   recreational activities in different salt marshes depending on the
   degree of exposure to humans and seasonal variations in tolerance. We
   recommend a minimum approaching distance of 63 m and buffer areas of 1.3
   ha around Belding's Savannah Sparrows.}},

Title = {{Contrasting Population Trends at Two Razorbill Colonies in Atlantic
   Canada: Additive Effects of Fox Predation and Hunting Mortality?}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{We developed a stochastic, stage-based, matrix-projection population
   model to assess population viability and estimate the impact of
   mortality caused by hunting, illegal and incidental to the murre (Uria
   sp.) hunt, and fox (Alopex lagopus) predation on Razorbill (Alca torda)
   populations breeding on the Gannet Islands, Labrador, the ``affected{''}
   population, and Machias Seal Island, New Brunswick, the ``unaffected{''}
   population. We estimated the potential population growth rate in the
   absence of anthropogenic mortality sources by using juvenile survival
   estimates from the relatively unaffected Machias Seal Island Razorbill
   population. We used data collected on fox predation on the Gannet
   Islands from 1978-2009 to estimate the change in productivity as a
   result of fox presence. The intrinsic growth rate (lambda) of the
   stochastic matrix based on vital rates from the Gannet Islands was 0.957
   +/- 0.008 and 1.058 +/- 0.005 for Machias Seal Island. Hunting mortality
   reduced the predicted Gannet Islands population growth rate by 0.033,
   while fox predation reduced population growth rate by 0.017. These
   sources combined reduced the baseline population growth rate by 0.050.
   According to our model, the Razorbill population on Machias Seal Island
   appears to be growing rapidly. In contrast, the Gannet Islands
   population may decline, likely because of hunting. However,
   oceanographic differences between the two areas and uncertainty
   regarding dispersal behavior in this species may also contribute to the
   disparity between populations. Based on our findings, we make several
   recommendations for the conservation and management of Razorbills in
   Atlantic Canada.}},

Abstract = {{We used ground surveys to identify breeding habitat for Whimbrel
   (Numenius phaeopus) in the outer Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories,
   and to test the value of high-resolution IKONOS imagery for mapping
   additional breeding habitat in the Delta. During ground surveys, we
   found Whimbrel nests (n = 28) in extensive areas of wet-sedge
   low-centered polygon (LCP) habitat on two islands in the Delta (Taglu
   and Fish islands) in 2006 and 2007. Supervised classification using
   spectral analysis of IKONOS imagery successfully identified additional
   areas of wet-sedge habitat in the region. However, ground surveys to
   test this classification found that many areas of wet-sedge habitat had
   dense shrubs, no standing water, and/or lacked polygon structure and did
   not support breeding Whimbrel. Visual examination of the IKONOS imagery
   was necessary to determine which areas exhibited LCP structure. Much
   lower densities of nesting Whimbrel were also found in upland habitats
   near wetlands. We used habitat maps developed from a combination of
   methods, to perform scenario analyses to estimate the potential effects
   of the Mackenzie Gas Project on Whimbrel habitat. Assuming effective
   complete habitat loss within 20 m, 50 m, or 250 m of any infrastructure
   or pipeline, the currently proposed pipeline development would result in
   loss of 8\%, 12\%, or 30\% of existing Whimbrel habitat. If subsidence
   were to occur, most Whimbrel habitat could become unsuitable. If the
   facility is developed, follow-up surveys will be required to test these
   models.}},

   chrysoptera)}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Widespread population declines of the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora
   chrysoptera) are thought to be due in part to hybridization with the
   expanding Blue-winged Warbler (V. pinus), which predictably replaces
   Golden-winged Warblers at breeding sites in which the two species come
   into contact. However, the mechanism by which this replacement occurs
   remains unresolved. Recent genetic work has indicated that, even in
   areas where the two species have been in contact for a short period,
   introgression of Blue-winged mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genes
   into Golden-winged individuals is common. To explore this process on a
   broader scale, we screened more than 750 individuals from nine U. S.
   states and three provinces to examine geographic patterns of mtDNA
   introgression. The only population in which all phenotypic Golden-winged
   Warblers had Golden-winged mtDNA haplotypes, and in which there are no
   breeding Blue-winged or hybrid individuals, was in the province of
   Manitoba, near the northwestern edge of the species' breeding
   distribution. The near ubiquity of mitochondrial introgression suggests
   that there are far fewer genetically pure populations of Golden-winged
   Warblers than previously believed, a finding with important implications
   for this threatened species.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about juvenile songbird movement in response to timber
   harvest, particularly in the boreal forest. If clearcut land cover
   facilitates movement, the availability of resources may increase.
   However, if clearcut land cover impedes movement, important
   post-fledging resources may be rendered inaccessible. Using radio
   telemetry, we tested the hypothesis that regenerating clearcut land
   cover would affect the movement of recently independent Yellow-rumped
   Myrtle Warblers (Dendroica coronata coronata) and Blackpoll Warblers
   (Dendroica striata) differently than forested land cover owing to
   intrinsic differences in each land-cover type or in how they are
   perceived. We found that both species moved extensively before
   migration. We also found that Blackpoll Warblers were quick to exit
   local areas composed of clearcut land cover and that both species were
   quick to exit neighborhoods composed of large proportions of clearcut
   land cover. However, if individuals encountered clearcut land cover when
   exiting the neighborhood, movement rate was slowed. Effectively,
   residency time decreased in clearcut neighborhoods and landscape
   connectivity was impeded by clearcut land cover. Our results suggest
   that clearcut land cover may represent low-quality habitat for both
   species during the post-fledging period. Further research is needed to
   determine if changes in movement behavior associated with landscape
   structure affect individual condition and higher-level ecological
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated home-range characteristics and habitat selection by
   Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in an unburned, boreal
   forest landscape managed by mosaic harvesting in Quebec, Canada. Habitat
   selection by this species was specifically examined to determine
   home-range establishment and foraging activities. We hypothesized that
   Black-backed Woodpeckers would respond to harvesting by adjusting their
   home-range size as a function of the amount of dead wood available.
   Twenty-two birds were tracked using radiotelemetry, and reliable
   estimates of home-range size were obtained for seven breeding
   individuals (six males and one female). The average home-range size was
   151.5 +/- 18.8 ha (range: 100.4-256.4 ha). Our results indicate that
   this species establishes home ranges in areas where both open and
   forested habitats are available. However, during foraging activities,
   individuals preferentially selected areas dominated by old coniferous
   stands. The study also showed that the spatial distribution of preferred
   foraging habitat patches influenced space use, with home-range area
   increasing with the median distance between old coniferous habitat
   patches available within the landscape. Finally, these data show that
   Black-backed Woodpeckers may successfully breed in an unburned forest
   with at least 35 m(3) . ha(-1) of dead wood, of which 42\% (15 m(3) .
   ha(-1)) is represented by dead wood at the early decay stage.}},

Abstract = {{Large secondary-nesting birds such as ducks rely on appropriate cavities
   for breeding. The main objective of this study was to assess the
   availability of large cavities and the potential of a managed boreal
   coniferous landscape to provide nesting trees within the breeding area
   of the eastern population of Barrow's Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica), a
   cavity-nesting species at risk in Canada. Woodpecker surveys were
   conducted in both conifer and mixed-wood landscapes, and cavities were
   sought in line transects distributed in unharvested and linear remnant
   stands of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and black spruce (Picea mariana)
   as well as in cutblocks. No Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus)
   were detected in the breeding area of Barrow's Goldeneye, but the
   species was present in the nearby lowland area in which trembling aspen
   (Populus tremuloides) is abundant. Only 10 trees (0.2\% of those
   sampled) supported cavities considered suitable for Barrow's Goldeneye
   in terms of dimensions and canopy openness. Most of the suitable
   cavities found during this study were nonexcavated apical (chimney)
   cavities in relatively short snags that showed advanced states of decay.
   A diameter-at-breast-height threshold was determined for each tree
   species, after which the probability of cavity occurrence was enhanced
   in terms of potential cavity trees for Barrow's Goldeneye. Remnant
   linear forest sites had lower potential tree densities than did their
   unharvested equivalents. Large cavities were thus a rare component in
   this boreal landscape, suggesting that they may be a limiting factor for
   this population at risk. Current even-aged forest management that mainly
   relies on clear-cut practices is likely to further reduce the potential
   of this landscape to provide trees with suitable cavities.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the influence of a spruce budworm (Choristoneura
   fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreak on a boreal mixed-wood bird community in
   forest stands ranging in age from 0 to 223 yr. We asked if (1) patterns
   of species response were consistent with the existence of spruce budworm
   specialists, i.e., species that respond in a stronger quantitative or
   qualitative way than other species; (2) the superabundance of food made
   it possible for species to expand their habitat use in age classes that
   were normally less used; and (3) the response to budworm was limited to
   specialists or was it more widespread. Results here indicated that three
   species, specifically the Bay-breasted Warbler (Dendroica castanea),
   Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), and Cape May Warbler (Dendroica
   tigrina), had a larger numerical response to the budworm outbreak. They
   responded with increases in density of up to tenfold over 4 or 5 yr. No
   other species responded with more than a twofold increase in the same
   time period. These species also showed a functional response by breeding
   more frequently in young stands aged 1-21 yr and intermediate stands
   aged 22-36 yr as budworm numbers increased. Our data also suggested that
   many species profited to a lesser extent from budworm outbreaks, but
   that this effect may be too subtle to detect in most studies. We found
   evidence of a positive numerical effect in at least 18 additional
   species in one or two stand-age categories but never in all three for
   any one species. Given the numerical response in many species and the
   potential influence of budworm on bird populations because of the vast
   extent of outbreaks, we believe that the population cycle of spruce
   budworm should be considered in any evaluation of population trends in
   eastern boreal birds.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Small Population Paradigm for Rare Large-Bodied
   Woodpeckers, with Implications for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Six large-bodied, >= 120 g, woodpecker species are listed as
   near-threatened to critically endangered by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The small population paradigm assumes
   that these populations are likely to become extinct without an increase
   in numbers, but the combined influences of initial population size and
   demographic rates, i.e., annual adult survival and fecundity, may drive
   population persistence for these species. We applied a stochastic,
   stage-based single-population model to available demographic rates for
   Dryocopus and Campephilus woodpeckers. In particular, we determined the
   change in predicted extinction rate, i.e., proportion of simulated
   populations that went extinct within 100 yr, to concomitant changes in
   six input parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   evaluate the combined importance of initial population size and
   demographic rates for the persistence of large-bodied woodpeckers. Under
   a worse-case scenario, the median time to extinction was 7 yr (range:
   1-32). Across the combinations of other input values, increasing initial
   population size by one female induced, on average, 0.4\%-3.2\% (range:
   0\%-28\%) reduction in extinction rate. Increasing initial population
   size from 5-30 resulted in extinction rates < 0.05 under limited
   conditions: (1) all input values were intermediate, or (2) Allee effect
   present and annual adult survival >= 0.8. Based on our model, these
   species can persist as rare, as few as five females, and thus
   difficult-to-detect, populations provided they maintain >= 1.1 recruited
   females annually per adult female and an annual adult survival rate >=
   0.8. Athough a demographic-based population viability analysis (PVA) is
   useful to predict how extinction rate changes across scenarios for
   life-history attributes, the next step for modeling these populations
   should incorporate more easily acquired data on changes in patch
   occupancy to make predictions about patch colonization and extinction
   rates.}},

Title = {{When is an ``Extinct{''} Species Really Extinct? Gauging the Search
   Efforts for Hawaiian Forest Birds and the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rare species, particularly those in inaccessible habitat, can go years
   without being observed. If we are to allocate conservation resources
   appropriately to conserving such species, it is important to be able to
   distinguish ``rare{''} from ``extinct.{''} Criteria for designating
   extinction, however, tend to be arbitrary or vaguely defined. This
   designation should not be made unless the search effort has been
   sufficient to yield a high degree of confidence that the species is in
   fact absent. We develop models to assess the probability of extinction
   and the search effort necessary to detect an individual in a small
   population. We apply these models to searches for nine potentially
   extinct Hawaiian forest birds and for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker
   (Campephilus principalis) in intensively searched areas in Arkansas. The
   Hawaiian forest bird survey was extensive, providing excellent
   information on population sizes and habitat associations of species
   encountered during the survey. Nonetheless, we conclude that the survey
   effort was not sufficient to conclude extinction (p > 0.90) for
   populations of 10 or fewer individuals for those species that were not
   encountered during surveys. In contrast, our analysis for Ivory-billed
   Woodpeckers suggests that, unless there were actually two or fewer birds
   present, the search effort was sufficient to conclude (p > 0.95) that
   Ivory-billed woodpeckers were not present in the intensively searched
   area. If one assumes distributions other than uniform, there is a
   greater chance that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers may persist in the
   intensively searched areas. Conclusions regarding occupancy of suitable
   habitat throughout the rest of the former range will require similarly
   intensive survey efforts. The degree of confidence in the absence of the
   Ivory-billed Woodpecker depended in part on our assumptions about the
   distribution of birds in the search area. For species with limited
   detection distance and small populations, a massive search effort may be
   required to conclude with confidence that a species is unlikely to be
   extant.}},

Title = {{Understanding Demographic and Behavioral Mechanisms that Guide Responses

Abstract = {{Although studies often report that densities of many forest birds are
   negatively related to urbanization, the mechanisms guiding this pattern
   are poorly understood. Our objective was to use a population simulation
   to examine the relative influence of six demographic and behavioral
   processes on patterns of avian abundance in urbanizing landscapes. We
   constructed an individual-based population simulation model representing
   the annual cycle of a Neotropical migratory songbird. Each simulation
   was performed under two landscape scenarios. The first scenario had
   similar proportions of high- and low-quality habitat across the urban to
   rural gradient. Under the first scenario, avian density was negatively
   related to urbanization only when rural habitats were perceived to be of
   higher quality than they actually were. The second landscape scenario
   had declining proportions of high-quality habitat as urbanization
   increased. Under the second scenario, each mechanism generated a
   negative relationship between density and urbanization. The strongest
   effect on density resulted when birds preferentially selected habitats
   in landscapes from which they fledged or were constrained from
   dispersing. The next strongest patterns occurred when birds directly
   evaluated habitat quality and accurately selected the highest-quality
   available territories. When birds selected habitats based on the
   presence of conspecifics, the density-urbanization relationship was only
   one-third the strength of other habitat selection mechanisms and only
   occurred under certain levels of population survival. Although
   differences in adult or nest survival in the face of random habitat
   selection still elicited reduced densities in urban landscapes, the
   relationships between urbanization and density were weaker than those
   produced by the conspecific attraction mechanism. Results from our study
   identify key predictions and areas for future research, including
   assessing habitat quality in urban and rural areas in order to determine
   if habitats in urban areas are underutilized.}},

Title = {{Site Safety and Food Affect Movements of Semipalmated Sandpipers
   (Calidris pusilla) Migrating Through the Upper Bay of Fundy}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The upper Bay of Fundy is a critical stopover site for Semipalmated
   Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) during their fall migration. However,
   little is known about factors that influence selection of feeding and
   roosting sites by these birds, or the extent to which birds move between
   different sites during their time in the region. Using radio-telemetry,
   we studied movement patterns, examined habitat use, and tested
   hypotheses associated with factors influencing foraging and roost-site
   selection. Movements of radio-tagged sandpipers were tracked in the
   upper Bay of Fundy in August 2004 and 2005. In 2004, sandpipers from the
   Minas Basin, Nova Scotia and Chignecto Bay, New Brunswick and Nova
   Scotia, were tracked, and in 2005, sandpipers were tracked only in
   Chignecto Bay. Sandpipers were highly mobile in both the Minas Basin
   2004 and Chignecto Bay 2005, making daily movements of up to 20 km
   between foraging and roosting sites, although very little movement was
   detected in Chignecto Bay in 2004. Migrating sandpipers appeared to
   select foraging sites based on relative safety, as measured by distance
   to cover, provided that these sites offered an adequate food supply.
   Similarly, roosting sandpipers preferred sites that were far from nearby
   trees that might offer cover to predators. This preference for safe
   sites became more apparent later in their stay in the Bay of Fundy, when
   birds were heavier and, therefore, possibly more vulnerable to
   predation. Semipalmated Sandpipers appear to be flexible during their
   time in the upper Bay of Fundy, displaying year-to-year and site-to-site
   variability in movement and mudflat usage. Therefore, multiple,
   synchronized population counts should be conducted at known roost sites
   in order to more accurately estimate Semipalmated Sandpiper abundance in
   this region. Furthermore, in a highly dynamic system where food can be
   variable, landscape features such as distance to cover may be important
   factors to consider when selecting candidate sites for shorebird
   conservation measures.}},

Title = {{Contrasting Effects of Cattle Grazing Intensity on Upland-Nesting Duck
   Production at Nest and Field Scales in the Aspen Parkland, Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The Aspen Parkland of Canada is one of the most important breeding areas
   for temperate nesting ducks in North America. The region is dominated by
   agricultural land use, with approximately 9.3 million ha in pasture land
   for cattle grazing. However, the effects of using land for cattle
   grazing on upland-nesting duck production are poorly understood. The
   current study was undertaken during 2001 and 2002 to investigate how
   nest density and nesting success of upland-nesting ducks varied with
   respect to the intensity of cattle grazing in the Aspen Parkland. We
   predicted that the removal and trampling of vegetation through cattle
   grazing would reduce duck nest density. Both positive and negative
   responses of duck nesting success to grazing have been reported in
   previous studies, leading us to test competing hypotheses that nesting
   success would (1) decline linearly with grazing intensity or (2) peak at
   moderate levels of grazing. Nearly 3300 ha of upland cover were searched
   during the study. Despite extensive and severe drought, nest searches
   located 302 duck nests. As predicted, nest density was higher in fields
   with lower grazing intensity and higher pasture health scores. A lightly
   grazed field with a pasture score of 85 out of a possible 100 was
   predicted to have 16.1 nests/100 ha (95\% CI = 11.7-22.1), more than
   five times the predicted nest density of a heavily grazed field with a
   pasture score of 58 (3.3 nests/100 ha, 95\% CI = 2.2-4.5). Nesting
   success was positively related to nest-site vegetation density across
   most levels of grazing intensity studied, supporting our hypothesis that
   reductions in vegetation caused by grazing would negatively affect
   nesting success. However, nesting success increased with grazing
   intensity at the field scale. For example, nesting success for a
   well-concealed nest in a lightly grazed field was 11.6\% (95\% CI =
   3.6-25.0\%), whereas nesting success for a nest with the same level of
   nest-site vegetation in a heavily grazed field was 33.9\% (95\% CI =
   17.0-51.8\%). Across the range of residual cover observed in this study,
   nests with above-average nest-site vegetation density had nesting
   success rates that exceeded the levels believed necessary to maintain
   duck populations. Our findings on complex and previously unreported
   relationships between grazing, nest density, and nesting success provide
   useful insights into the management and conservation of ground-nesting
   grassland birds.}},

   Ground Selenium Levels in Boreal White-Winged Scoters}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The effect of cross-seasonal interactions on reproduction and fitness in
   migratory species is of increasing interest to ecologists, particularly
   because of the conservation implications of habitat change. Variation in
   contaminant levels that can affect reproduction in migratory species may
   reflect differing exposure across seasons. We examined the relationship
   between concentrations of liver selenium, a known teratogen, and winter
   trophic level in breeding White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) using
   claw delta N-15 values as an index of winter trophic level. Claw delta
   N-15 was a significant predictor of variation in breeding ground
   selenium levels (r = 0.32), and liver selenium increased by
   approximately 12 +/- 5 SE mu g.g(-1) with one trophic level increase in
   delta N-15 (Delta 3 parts per thousand). This relationship demonstrates
   that contaminant exposure from wintering or staging areas can result in
   higher levels in birds on breeding grounds, where some contaminants are
   more likely to have impacts.}},

Title = {{Seasonal Patterns in Hydrogen Isotopes of Claws from Breeding
   Wood-Warblers (Parulidae): Utility for Estimating Migratory Origins}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The global decline in many species of migratory birds has focused
   attention on the extent of migratory connectivity between breeding and
   wintering populations. Stable-hydrogen isotope (delta D) analysis of
   feathers is a useful technique for measuring connectivity, but is
   constrained by features of molt location and timing. Claws are
   metabolically inert, keratinous tissues that grow continuously and can
   be sampled at any point in the annual cycle, thus providing potentially
   useful clues about an individual's previous movements. However,
   variation in the rate at which claws incorporate local dD values is not
   well described. We measured delta D values in claws of two species of
   Neotropical-Nearctic migrant wood-warblers (Golden-winged Warbler and
   Cerulean Warbler) breeding in eastern Ontario, Canada to investigate the
   rate of delta D change through the breeding season and the utility of
   claw delta D values for estimating migratory origins. delta D values of
   claw tips from 66 different individuals, each sampled once during the
   breeding season, showed an average change of -0.3\% to -0.4\% per day in
   the direction of the expected local Ontario value. There were no
   significant sex or species differences in the rate of change. These
   results suggest delta D values of claw tips in Parulids may reflect
   those of the non-breeding area for 3-7 weeks after arrival on the
   breeding grounds, and are useful estimators of non-breeding migratory
   origin. Our results also suggest that these species may leave the
   breeding ground before claw tips fully incorporate a local delta D
   signature, as claws sampled at the end of the breeding season did not
   match locally grown feather and claw delta D values. This is the first
   study to examine the seasonal rate of the change in delta D values of
   claws in long-distance, insectivorous, migratory birds.}},

Abstract = {{The use of density to measure a species' responses to habitat change
   remains prevalent despite warnings that relying on such parameters can
   be misleading. We evaluated whether density was a useful surrogate of
   habitat quality for the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis),
   an apparent habitat generalist, in a recently logged landscape near
   Calling Lake, Alberta, Canada. We detected significant differences in
   the territory density of birds among three distinct habitat types:
   interior forest, forest edges, and recent (4- to 6-yr-old) clear-cuts.
   However, the observed patterns in territory density were not consistent
   with several indices of habitat quality. We found a consistent and
   marked gradient for indices such as nesting success (based on a
   reproductive index), pairing success, and the proportion of territories
   that successfully fledged young between interior forest sites and
   clear-cuts. Edge habitats, in which high relative density offset lower
   reproductive success, represented moderate-quality habitat for this
   species. Our results suggest that the continued use of density alone,
   without some measure of habitat quality, is insufficient if not
   misleading when evaluating response to habitat change. Our results have
   important implications for understanding the population dynamics of this
   species, which is often overlooked in population-level studies yet
   continues to experience long-term population declines over large
   portions of its breeding range.}},

Abstract = {{To migrate successfully, birds need to store adequate fat reserves to
   fuel each leg of the journey. Migrants acquire their fuel reserves at
   stopover sites; this often entails exposure to predators. Therefore, the
   safety attributes of sites may be as important as the feeding
   opportunities. Furthermore, site choice might depend on fuel load, with
   lean birds more willing to accept danger to obtain good feeding. Here,
   we evaluate the factors underlying stopover-site usage by migrant
   Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) on a landscape scale. We measured
   the food and danger attributes of 17 potential stopover sites in the
   Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound region. We used logistic regression
   models to test whether food, safety, or both were best able to predict
   usage of these sites by Western Sandpipers. Eight of the 17 sites were
   used by sandpipers on migration. Generally, sites that were high in food
   and safety were used, whereas sites that were low in food and safety
   were not. However, dangerous sites were used if there was ample food
   abundance, and sites with low food abundance were used if they were
   safe. The model including both food and safety best-predicted site usage
   by sandpipers. Furthermore, lean sandpipers used the most dangerous
   sites, whereas heavier birds (which do not need to risk feeding in
   dangerous locations) used safer sites. This study demonstrates that both
   food and danger attributes are considered by migrant birds when
   selecting stopover sites, thus both these attributes should be
   considered to prioritize and manage stopover sites for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital map products that integrate long-term duck population and
   land-use data are currently being used to guide conservation program
   delivery on the Canadian Prairies. However, understanding the
   inter-relationships between ducks and other grassland bird species would
   greatly enhance program planning and delivery. We hypothesized that
   ducks, and Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) in particular, may function as
   an umbrella guild for the overall breeding habitat quality for other
   grassland bird species. We compared grassland bird species richness and
   relative abundance among areas of low, moderate, and high predicted
   waterfowl breeding densities (i.e., duck density strata) in the southern
   Missouri Coteau, Saskatchewan. We conducted roadside point counts and
   delineated habitats within a 400 m radius of each point. The duck
   high-density stratum supported greater avian species richness and
   abundance than did the duck low-density stratum. Overall, duck and other
   grassland bird species richness and abundance were moderately
   correlated, with all r between 0.37 and 0.69 (all P < 0.05). Although
   the habitat requirements of Northern Pintail may overlap with those of
   other grassland endemics, priority grassland bird species richness was
   only moderately correlated with total pintail abundance in both years,
   and the abundances of pintail and grassland songbirds listed by the
   Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada were not
   correlated. No differences in the mean number of priority grassland
   species were detected among the strata. Adequate critical habitat for
   several priority species may not be protected if conservation is focused
   only in areas of moderate to high wetland density because large tracts
   of contiguous, dry grassland habitat (e. g., pasture) occur infrequently
   in high-quality duck habitat.}},

Abstract = {{There exists little information on demographic responses of boreal
   songbirds to logging. We conducted a 4-yr (2003-2006) songbird
   mark-recapture study in western Newfoundland, where land cover is a
   naturally heterogeneous mosaic of productive spruce-fir forest, stunted
   taiga, and openings such as bogs, fens, and riparian zones. We compared
   apparent survival and rate of transience for adults of 14 species
   between areas having forests fragmented primarily by either natural
   openings or 3-7 yr-old clearcuts. Data were collected on three landscape
   pairs, with birds being marked on three 4-6 ha netting sites on each
   landscape (total = 18 netting sites). Survival rates were estimated
   using multi-strata mark-recapture models with landscape types specified
   as model strata. Landscape type was retained in the best model for only
   two species, Ruby-crowned Kinglet and Yellow-rumped Warbler, in both
   cases indicating lower apparent survival in landscapes having clearcuts.
   Though parameter estimates suggested lower survival in clearcut
   landscapes for several species, meta-analysis across all species
   detected no general difference between landscape types. Further, we did
   not detect any relation between landscape differences in survival and a
   species' habitat affinity, migratory strategy, or the proportion of
   transients in its population. Although sensitivity to logging was
   limited, we observed high interspecific variation in rates of breeding
   season apparent survival (48\% {[}Dark-eyed Junco] to 100\% {[}several
   species]), overwinter apparent survival (0.3\% {[}Ruby-crowned Kinglet]
   to 86.5\% {[}Gray Jay]), and transience (approximate to 0\% {[}several
   species] to 61\% {[}Ruby-crowned Kinglet in clearcut landscapes]). For
   Lincoln's and White-throated Sparrows, over-winter apparent survival was
   > 2x higher for males than females, and rate of transience was > 8x
   higher for White-throated Sparrow males than females. Moderately
   male-biased sex ratios suggested that both lower mortality and higher
   site fidelity contributed to higher apparent survival of males. Overall,
   variability in our estimates of survival was too great to be explained
   by mortality alone, suggesting a large influence of landscape-scale
   movement by adults, e. g., breeding dispersal, extra-territorial forays,
   and transience, on the dynamics of boreal songbird populations. These
   movement patterns may also confer resilience to localized disturbance in
   boreal landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The time-of-detection method for aural avian point counts is a new
   method of estimating abundance, allowing for uncertain probability of
   detection. The method has been specifically designed to allow for
   variation in singing rates of birds. It involves dividing the time
   interval of the point count into several subintervals and recording the
   detection history of the subintervals when each bird sings. The method
   can be viewed as generating data equivalent to closed capture-recapture
   information. The method is different from the distance and
   multiple-observer methods in that it is not required that all the birds
   sing during the point count. As this method is new and there is some
   concern as to how well individual birds can be followed, we carried out
   a field test of the method using simulated known populations of singing
   birds, using a laptop computer to send signals to audio stations
   distributed around a point. The system mimics actual aural avian point
   counts, but also allows us to know the size and spatial distribution of
   the populations we are sampling. Fifty 8-min point counts (broken into
   four 2-min intervals) using eight species of birds were simulated.
   Singing rate of an individual bird of a species was simulated following
   a Markovian process (singing bouts followed by periods of silence),
   which we felt was more realistic than a truly random process. The main
   emphasis of our paper is to compare results from species singing at
   (high and low) homogenous rates per interval with those singing at (high
   and low) heterogeneous rates. Population size was estimated accurately
   for the species simulated, with a high homogeneous probability of
   singing. Populations of simulated species with lower but homogeneous
   singing probabilities were somewhat underestimated. Populations of
   species simulated with heterogeneous singing probabilities were
   substantially underestimated. Underestimation was caused by both the
   very low detection probabilities of all distant individuals and by
   individuals with low singing rates also having very low detection
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The biggest challenge in conservation biology is breaking down the gap
   between research and practical management. A major obstacle is the fact
   that many researchers are unwilling to tackle projects likely to produce
   sparse or messy data because the results would be difficult to publish
   in refereed journals. The obvious solution to sparse data is to build up
   results from multiple studies. Consequently, we suggest that there needs
   to be greater emphasis in conservation biology on publishing papers that
   can be built on by subsequent research rather than on papers that
   produce clear results individually. This building approach requires: (1)
   a stronger theoretical framework, in which researchers attempt to
   anticipate models that will be relevant in future studies and
   incorporate expected differences among studies into those models; (2)
   use of modern methods for model selection and multi-model inference, and
   publication of parameter estimates under a range of plausible models;
   (3) explicit incorporation of prior information into each case study;
   and (4) planning management treatments in an adaptive framework that
   considers treatments applied in other studies. We encourage journals to
   publish papers that promote this building approach rather than expecting
   papers to conform to traditional standards of rigor as stand-alone
   papers, and believe that this shift in publishing philosophy would
   better encourage researchers to tackle the most urgent conservation
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Population life-history traits such as the propensity to move across
   inhospitable landscapes should be shaped by exposure to landscape
   structure over evolutionary time. Thus, birds that recently evolved in
   landscapes fragmented by natural disturbances such as fire would be
   expected to show greater behavioral and morphological vagility relative
   to conspecifics that evolved under less patchy landscapes shaped by
   fewer and finer-scaled disturbances, i.e., the resilience hypothesis.
   These predictions are not new, but they remain largely untested, even
   for well-studied taxa such as neotropical migrant birds. We combined two
   experimental translocation, i.e., homing, studies to test whether
   Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla, from the historically dynamic boreal
   mixedwood forest of north-central Alberta (n = 55) is more vagile than
   Ovenbird from historically less dynamic deciduous forest of southern
   Quebec (n = 89). We found no regional difference in either wing loading
   or the response of homing Ovenbird to landscape structure. Nevertheless,
   this study presents a heuristic framework that can advance the
   understanding of boreal landscape dynamics as an evolutionary force.}},

Title = {{Contributions of Weather and Predation to Reduced Breeding Success in a
   Threatened Northern Loggerhead Shrike Population}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Populations on the periphery of a species' range may experience more
   severe environmental conditions relative to populations closer to the
   core of the range. As a consequence, peripheral populations may have
   lower reproductive success or survival, which may affect their
   persistence. In this study, we examined the influence of environmental
   conditions on breeding biology and nest survival in a threatened
   population of Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) at the northern
   limit of the range in southeastern Alberta, Canada, and compared our
   estimates with those from shrike populations elsewhere in the range.
   Over the 2-year study in 1992-1993, clutch sizes averaged 6.4 eggs, and
   most nests were initiated between mid-May and mid-June. Rate of
   renesting following initial nest failure was 19\%, and there were no
   known cases of double-brooding. Compared with southern populations, rate
   of renesting was lower and clutch sizes tended to be larger, whereas the
   length of the nestling and hatchling periods appeared to be similar.
   Most nest failures were directly associated with nest predators, but
   weather had a greater direct effect in 1993. Nest survival models
   indicated higher daily nest survival during warmer temperatures and
   lower precipitation, which may include direct effects of weather on
   nestlings as well as indirect effects on predator behavior or food
   abundance. Daily nest survival varied over the nesting cycle in a
   curvilinear pattern, with a slight increase through laying,
   approximately constant survival through incubation, and a decline
   through the nestling period. Partial brood loss during the nestling
   stage was high, particularly in 1993, when conditions were cool and wet.
   Overall, the lower likelihood of renesting, lower nest survival, and
   higher partial brood loss appeared to depress reproductive output in
   this population relative to those elsewhere in the range, and may have
   increased susceptibility to population declines.}},

Abstract = {{The Prairie Pothole Region of North America has been modified by
   agriculture during the past 100 yr, resulting in habitat loss,
   fragmentation, and degradation that have reduced the abundance and
   productivity of many wildlife species. The 1985 U. S. Farm Bill provided
   economic incentives to agriculture that are considered by many to be
   beneficial to nesting waterfowl and other wildlife. Canada has not
   experienced an equally comprehensive legislative initiative, which would
   seem to indicate that benefits to waterfowl in Canada should lag behind
   those in the United States. However, with the removal of some
   agricultural subsidies in Canada during the 1990s, the amount of
   perennial cover in the Canadian prairies increased to levels similar to
   those of the 1970s. Therefore, it is unclear whether and how the U. S.
   and Canadian prairies might differ with regard to habitat quality for
   nesting waterfowl. We used historical and contemporary data to compare
   temporal trends in duck nest success between the United States and
   Canada and to assess how mean nest success varied with proportion of
   cropland and wetland density. The data best supported models with
   nonlinear temporal trends that varied between the two countries and
   suggested that mean nest success in Canada declined from its high point
   in 1930s and remained below the long-term value of 0.16 until the end of
   the time series in 2005. Mean nest success in the United States also
   declined from its high point in the 1930s, but increased to above the
   long-term value of 0.25 during the early 2000s. Mean nest success varied
   negatively with proportion of cropland in both the United States and
   Canada. Mean nest success was positively correlated with pond density at
   Canadian sites, but showed only a weak association with pond density at
   U. S. sites. All models explained the low proportions of the variation
   in nest success, suggesting that unmeasured factors such as the
   abundance and identity of nest predators may have strong effects on nest
   success. Nonetheless, these results support earlier suggestions that
   agricultural policy that encourages permanent cover positively
   influences duck reproductive success. We also found that, for reasons
   that are not entirely clear, nest success for the same intensity of row
   cropping was generally higher in the United States than in Canada.
   Further research is required to elucidate the exact nature of the
   composition, size, and distribution of permanent cover that coincides
   with greater average nest success by dabbling ducks in the United
   States. In addition, the data suggest that the benefits that might
   accrue from increases in the amount of perennial cover in Canada would
   be better realized if these efforts are accompanied by strong measures
   to conserve wetlands.}},

Title = {{Slopes of Avian Species-Area Relationships, Human Population Density,
   and Environmental Factors}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in how humans influence spatial patterns in
   biodiversity. One of the most frequently noted and marked of these
   patterns is the increase in species richness with area, the species-area
   relationship (SAR). SARs are used for a number of conservation purposes,
   including predicting extinction rates, setting conservation targets, and
   identifying biodiversity hotspots. Such applications can be improved by
   a detailed understanding of the factors promoting spatial variation in
   the slope of SARs, which is currently the subject of a vigorous debate.
   Moreover, very few studies have considered the anthropogenic influences
   on the slopes of SARs; this is particularly surprising given that in
   much of the world areas with high human population density are typically
   those with a high number of species, which generates conservation
   conflicts. Here we determine correlates of spatial variation in the
   slopes of species-area relationships, using the British avifauna as a
   case study. Whilst we focus on human population density, a widely used
   index of human activities, we also take into account (1) the rate of
   increase in habitat heterogeneity with increasing area, which is
   frequently proposed to drive SARs, (2) environmental energy
   availability, which may influence SARs by affecting species occupancy
   patterns, and (3) species richness. We consider environmental variables
   measured at both local (10 km x 10 km) and regional (290 km x 290 km)
   spatial grains, but find that the former consistently provides a better
   fit to the data. In our case study, the effect of species richness on
   the slope SARs appears to be scale dependent, being negative at local
   scales but positive at regional scales. In univariate tests, the slope
   of the SAR correlates negatively with human population density and
   environmental energy availability, and positively with the rate of
   increase in habitat heterogeneity. We conducted two sets of multiple
   regression analyses, with and without species richness as a predictor.
   When species richness is included it exerts a dominant effect, but when
   it is excluded temperature has the dominant effect on the slope of the
   SAR, and the effects of other predictors are marginal.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fundamental role played by long-distance dispersal in
   population dynamics, the mechanisms promoting or inhibiting dispersal by
   migratory songbirds are poorly understood. We used stable-hydrogen
   isotopes (delta D) to evaluate several hypotheses related to
   long-distance dispersal in the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), a
   migratory songbird at the center of considerable conservation attention.
   Feather samples were collected from 103 males throughout the breeding
   range. We assumed feathers were molted in late summer on the breeding
   grounds and thus delta D values provided an estimate of breeding or
   hatching location for the previous year. We used a likelihood-based
   assignment test to estimate the origin of birds the previous year and
   derived expected delta D values for the entire Cerulean Warbler breeding
   range from precipitation-based maps. Using Bayes' Rule, we also
   incorporated a prior probability of breeding origin based on estimated
   rates of site fidelity and survival between breeding seasons. We found
   that long-distance breeding dispersal by adult male Cerulean Warblers
   was a fairly common occurrence with 20 of 71 (28.2\%) individuals
   originating from a region other than the one they were sampled in.
   Surprisingly, long-distance natal dispersal was uncommon; only three of
   32 (9.4\%) second-year birds were estimated to have hatched in a region
   outside their capture region. Young males may be using a form of
   post-fledging prospecting or conspecific attraction when selecting their
   first breeding habitats. Populations on the breeding range periphery,
   such as Ontario and Tennessee, tended to receive fewer long-distance
   dispersers than did other regions but produced more dispersing
   individuals than did core regions, suggesting that these areas could act
   as important sources for other regions. The tendency of a region to
   produce dispersing individuals was not significantly related to its
   relative abundance, implying that population abundance is not a good
   indicator of population health for this species. Range-wide variation in
   long-distance dispersal patterns may contribute to variation in
   sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation, further complicating
   conservation and management efforts for the Cerulean Warbler.}},

Abstract = {{Roadside surveys such as the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) are widely used
   to assess the relative abundance of bird populations. The accuracy of
   roadside surveys depends on the extent to which surveys from roads
   represent the entire region under study. We quantified roadside land
   cover sampling bias in Tennessee, USA, by comparing land cover
   proportions near roads to proportions of the surrounding region.
   Roadside surveys gave a biased estimate of patterns across the region
   because some land cover types were over-or underrepresented near roads.
   These biases changed over time, introducing varying levels of distortion
   into the data. We constructed simulated population trends for five bird
   species of management interest based on these measured roadside sampling
   biases and on field data on bird abundance. These simulations indicated
   that roadside surveys may give overly negative assessments of the
   population trends of early successional birds and of synanthropic birds,
   but not of late-successional birds. Because roadside surveys are the
   primary source of avian population trend information in North America,
   we conclude that these surveys should be corrected for roadside land
   cover sampling bias. In addition, current recommendations about the need
   to create more early successional habitat for birds may need
   reassessment in the light of the undersampling of this habitat by roads.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Body Condition on the Stopover Ecology of Least
   Sandpipers in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley during Fall
   Migration}},

Abstract = {{Many shorebirds are long-distance migrants and depend on the energy
   gained at stopover sites to complete migration. Competing hypotheses
   have described strategies used by migrating birds; the energy-selection
   hypothesis predicts that shorebirds attempt to maximize energy gained at
   stopover sites, whereas the time-selection hypothesis predicts that
   shorebirds attempt to minimize time spent at stopover sites. The
   energy-and time-selection hypotheses both predict that birds in better
   condition will depart sites sooner. However, numerous studies of
   stopover duration have found little support for this prediction, leading
   to the suggestion that migrating birds operate under energy and time
   constraints for only a small portion of the migratory season. During
   fall migration 2002, we tested the prediction that birds in better
   condition depart stopover sites sooner by examining the relationship
   between stopover duration and body condition for migrating Least
   Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) at three stopover sites in the Lower
   Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We also tested the assumption made by the
   Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley Migratory Bird Science Team that
   shorebirds stay in the Mississippi Valley for 10 d. The assumption of 10
   d was used to estimate the amount of habitat required by shorebirds in
   the Mississippi Valley during fall migration; a period longer than 10 d
   would increase the estimate of the amount habitat required. We used
   multiple-day constancy models of apparent survival and program MARK to
   estimate stopover duration for 293 individually color-marked and
   resighted Least Sandpipers. We found that a four-day constancy interval
   and a site x quadratic time trend interaction term best modeled apparent
   survival. We found only weak support for body condition as a factor
   explaining length of stopover duration, which is consistent with
   findings from similar work. Stopover duration estimates were 4.1 d (95\%
   CI = 2.8-6.1) for adult Least Sandpipers at Bald Knob National Wildlife
   Refuge, Arkansas, 6.5 d (95\% CI = 4.9-8.7) for adult and 6.1 d (95\% CI
   = 4.2-9.1) for juvenile Least Sandpipers at Yazoo National Wildlife
   Refuge, Mississippi, and 6.9 d (95\% CI = 5.5-8.7) for juvenile Least
   Sandpipers at Morgan Brake National Wildlife Refuge, Mississippi. Based
   on our estimates of stopover duration and the assumption made by the
   Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley Migratory Bird Science Team, there is
   sufficient habitat in the lower Mississippi Valley to support shorebirds
   during fall migration.}},

Abstract = {{Northern forests are major breeding habitats for several waterfowl and
   other waterbird species. In Quebec, as in many other areas within the
   boreal region, clear-cut logging is an important human activity, and it
   is likely to affect ground-and cavity-nesting species differently. We
   used Black Duck Joint Venture/Canadian Wildlife Service aerial survey
   data, together with Quebec digital forest maps, to investigate local,
   i.e., within 2 km of clear-cut areas, short-term (similar to 4 yr)
   effects of forest harvesting on waterfowl and Common Loon. Our
   predictions were that clear-cut logging would not affect ground nesters,
   but would negatively affect pair settling patterns in cavity nesters
   through nesting habitat disturbance. Our study spanned a 540,000-km(2)
   territory in which we considered over 30,000 ha of clear-cut areas that
   were dispersed into 42 different locations. We controlled for
   interannual variation in population size by comparing the pre-and
   post-harvest percentages of potentially hospitable nesting cover
   disturbed by timber harvesting within a 1-km radius of indicated
   breeding pairs. Our results suggest that timber harvesting positively
   influenced local populations of Canada Goose and American Green-winged
   Teal. No other ground-nesting species showed a significant response. For
   the cavity-nesting guild and species, we detected no local, short-term
   effect of clear-cutting. This result was unexpected because many
   previous studies of nest-box provisioning reported increased breeding
   pair densities, indicating that availability of natural holes may limit
   cavity-nesting duck populations. Moreover, because cavity-nesting ducks
   are considered among the most vulnerable bird species to forest
   management, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that boreal
   bird populations exhibit some resilience to disturbance. This conclusion
   follows from a study in landscapes where forests were mostly
   first-growth. It is not evident that it will remain valid following
   subsequent clear-cutting episodes and long-term forestry.}},

Title = {{Colony Dynamics and Persistence of Ivory Gull Breeding in Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the importance of assessing the viability of small and
   endangered populations, often few demographic data are available.
   However, when counts are available from discrete sites, a colony-or
   site-based approach can be useful. We used recent counts of Ivory Gull,
   Pagophila eburnea, a rare species that breeds at remote sites in the
   high Arctic, to model colony dynamics and population persistence.
   Dramatic declines in numbers of pairs nesting in Canada led to the
   uplisting of this species to Endangered by the Committee on the Status
   of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in 2006. Colonies continued to decline
   from 2004 to 2006, with sites at the southern edge of the breeding range
   on Baffin Island almost completely extirpated; only one pair remained in
   2005 and 2006. We used colony counts at 24 sites on southern Ellesmere
   Island and Devon Island from 2002 to 2006 to model extinction and
   colonization rates. Extinction rates were high at 0.735 +/- 0.077 (mean
   +/- SE) and increased for smaller colonies. Colonization rates were low
   at 0.189 +/- 0.054 (mean +/- SE), new colonies were small (mean: 7.7
   pairs), and there was no evidence of local rescue effects from nearby
   colonies. Based on these rates, a population projection model was
   constructed using a starting population of 225 pairs at the 24 sites.
   The projected population reached an equilibrium of approximately 30
   pairs in only 8 yr. The large and isolated colony on Seymour Island has
   declined at 2.7\%/yr (95\% confidence limits: -13.9, 8.5) since 1974,
   and had low but wide-ranging probabilities of going extinct within 20
   yr. The suggestion that Ellesmere Island may be the only site where
   breeding Ivory Gull will persist in the future is supported by the
   recent discovery of new colonies there in 2006.}},

Title = {{Pre-Migratory Movements by Juvenile Burrowing Owls in a Patchy Landscape}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dispersal is a fundamental aspect of population dynamics, and can have
   direct implications on processes such as the colonization of habitat
   patches. Pre-migratory movements, landscape fragmentation, and body
   condition have all been hypothesized as key factors influencing
   dispersal in birds, but little direct evidence exists to support these
   ideas. We used radio-telemetry and supplementary feeding to test if body
   condition or landscape pattern influenced pre-migratory movements of
   juvenile Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) in a fragmented landscape.
   We categorized grassland patches as either large (>= 95 ha) or small and
   isolated (<= 58 ha and >= 1.5 km to next nearest grassland patch), and
   young owls were either provided supplemental food as nestlings or not.
   Owlets receiving supplemental food and residing in large grassland
   patches moved a greater maximum distance from their nest than similarly
   fed owlets residing in small patches (large = 1605 +/- 443 m; small =
   373 +/- 148 m). In contrast, non-supplemented owlets from large and
   small patches did not differ in their maximum distance moved from the
   nest (large = 745 +/- 307 m; small 555 +/- 286 m). Only two of 32
   individuals from small patches moved >800 m, whereas ten of 23 owlets
   from large patches moved >800 m. In addition, owlets from large patches
   continued to move farther and farther from their nest before migration,
   whereas owlets in small, isolated patches ultimately moved <400 m from
   their nests before migration, despite having initiated dispersal in a
   manner similar to owlets from large patches. Our results, along with
   evidence we synthesize from previous studies, suggest that juvenile
   Burrowing Owls in small patches are unwilling or unable to cross the
   cropland matrix of a fragmented landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal is an important component in bird population dynamics
   and can influence the persistence of local and metapopulations. We
   examined natal dispersal in the North Island robin (Petroica longipes),
   a sedentary bird species distributed in a fragmented forest habitat on
   Tiritiri Matangi Island, New Zealand. Earlier studies have shown that
   the only dispersal phase in this species takes place when juveniles
   leave their natal patch, and that juveniles who fail to find suitable
   habitat do not survive their first winter. These findings suggest that
   natal dispersal behavior in this species is important for population
   viability. We found that juveniles were highly affected by the
   fragmentation of the forest habitat, with patch occupancy being
   positively correlated with degree of connectivity of the landscape. Most
   juvenile movements (52.1\%) were observed between patches that were
   separated by less than 20 m. Juvenile North Island robins were found in
   all forest habitat types, including young and open stands. This suggests
   that the juveniles are not dependent on old forest stands during their
   dispersal phase. Based on these findings, we suggest that management of
   this regionally-threatened species should focus not only on maintaining
   populations in occupied patches and increasing the habitat quality of
   these patches, but also on protecting existing forest patches acting as
   corridors and creating new forest habitat among patches. This would
   greatly increase the viability of the species' metapopulations by
   increasing dispersal success between both unoccupied patches and
   subpopulations. Additionally, increased connectivity between forest
   patches could also be expected to increase the probability of successful
   dispersal of other threatened native species, many of which are also
   sensitive to the high degree of fragmentation of their habitats.}},

   Egg-Color Variation}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that cryptically colored eggs would suffer less
   predation than conspicuous eggs in the ground-nesting red-legged
   partridge, Alectoris rufa. We used A. rufa as a model species because it
   has a wide range of natural egg colors, the eggs are widely available
   from breeding farms, and nests are easily mimicked because they are
   scrapes containing no vegetation. The study was conducted in the spring
   of 2001 in forest and fallow fields of central Spain in Castilla La
   Mancha, Ciudad Real. We used 384 clutches of natural eggs that were
   white, white spotted, brown, or brown spotted. Within clutches, eggs
   were consistent in color and size; among clutches, color differences
   were distributed across habitats. Clutches were checked once after 2 wk
   of exposure. Cryptic coloration had a survival advantage that was
   dependent on the local suite of predators. Rodent predation was
   nonselective with respect to clutch color; however, avian predation was
   significantly higher for conspicuous clutches. In addition, there was an
   interaction of landscape and egg color for avian predation. In forest
   landscapes, the clutches with highest survival were brown spotted,
   whereas in fallow landscapes, brown and brown spotted clutches had
   higher survival than white and white potted clutches. Thus, both the
   predator suite and the landscape had significant effects on the value of
   cryptic egg coloration. Our study is relevant for conservationists and
   managers in charge of restocking programs in hunting areas. The release
   of other partridge species or their hybrids could result in
   hybridization with wild partridges, potentially leading to nonoptimal
   clutch pigmentation and reduced survival of the native species. We
   therefore recommend that local authorities, managers, and
   conservationists be cautious with the use of alien species and hybrids
   and release only autochthonous species of partridges within their
   natural ranges.}},

Title = {{Retrospective Comparison of the Occurrence and Abundance of Rusty
   Blackbird in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rusty Blackbird is listed as a species of ``special concern{''} by the
   Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada, and has shown
   steep population declines in recent decades. Forty-five locations with
   historical survey data from the 1970s in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest
   Territories, Canada were revisited in 2006 to check for changes in the
   occurrence or abundance of Rusty Blackbird. Our retrospective analysis
   revealed a number of analytical challenges for such comparisons that we
   describe. The number of lakes on which this species occurred does not
   appear to have declined significantly in the past three decades when a
   correction for survey duration was applied. The range-wide decline of
   5.1\%/yr based on Christmas Bird Count data would have resulted in 2006
   occupancy at approximate to 5 lakes. We estimate that with correction
   this would have increased to approximate to 26. However, naive or
   unadjusted analyses with a Chi-squared test showed a significant
   decline. A simulated resampling of the historical data was performed
   using a repeatability factor of 62\% that was derived from a subset of
   historical lakes that was visited twice in the 1970s. Only 8 of 13 lakes
   resurveyed had the same results on both historical visits. Our
   unadjusted 2006 results are a likely outcome, i.e., a 14.9\% chance of
   finding this result, when this repeatability factor is considered, and
   the likelihood of no change is higher when our corrected data are
   considered. The possibility of double counting in the historical data
   further reduced the likelihood of a large decline in relative abundance.
   Therefore, Rusty Blackbird occurrence does not appear to have changed
   significantly in the past 33 yr in the Mackenzie Valley. We conclude
   with a qualitative discussion that supports the notion that declines in
   the southern parts of their range may be a large factor in the observed
   rates of population decline.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized recommendations for the conservation of birds in
   agro-ecosystems have been elusive because studies are often of a local
   nature, and do not compare source data against those from other regions.
   In this study, we developed geographically broad habitat relationship
   models to provide conservation prescriptions for three species that
   breed in farmed grasslands: Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Savannah
   Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Nelson's Sharp-tailed Sparrow
   (Ammodramus nelsoni subvirgatus). We develop models from our study in
   Nova Scotia, Canada and confront them with independent data from
   Wisconsin, USA pastures and Iowa, USA restored prairies. Vegetation that
   was higher and denser in the prebreeding season was linked to increased
   occupancy rates and abundance of Bobolinks in each study region.
   Providing tall spring grass is easily accomplished by not cutting late
   in the previous year. Savannah Sparrows were instead associated with
   shorter and sparser spring grass, which highlights the need to
   simultaneously provide heterogeneous habitat for otherwise ecologically
   similar species. Nelson's Sharp-tailed Sparrows were more likely to
   occur, and be numerous, in areas with greater availability of drainage
   ditches. They and several other species would benefit from provision of
   ditches with adequate vegetation to promote occupancy. By combining
   these with other well-established recommendations, such as a delayed
   first harvest, a greater net conservation benefit can be realized from
   these working landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of biodiversity is now a firmly entrenched objective of
   sustainable forest management, and emulating natural disturbance has
   been widely adopted as a conservation strategy. Yet the foundation for
   this approach is still very much a hypothesis based on first principles,
   and there has been little rigorous testing of the approach. In addition,
   practical constraints mean that the full range and character of natural
   patterns can never be implemented, so decisions must still be made in
   setting forest management targets and levels. An alternative, but
   complementary approach is to select a focal group of species and use
   their habitat requirements to define the range of conditions that should
   be maintained on the landscape. In this study, I used a balanced
   factorial sample design to test the effect of landscape vs. local scale
   factors for explaining relative abundance of 30 forest songbird species
   in boreal Ontario, and then examined components of variance, and used
   multivariate analysis and logistic regression to describe these
   relationships in more detail. Based on statistically defendable
   inferences and habitat model coefficients, 13 species were selected,
   with habitat associations ranging from high to low edge density,
   homogeneous to heterogeneous forest matrix, hardwood to softwood
   dominated overstory, young to old stands, and open to closed canopy. I
   found that variations in amount and configuration of mature forest cover
   had relatively little influence on the overall boreal forest songbird
   community, but that individual species differ in their response to these
   variables. To be successful, biodiversity conservation strategies must
   emulate the patterns created through natural disturbance by maintaining
   the full range of forest cover homogeneity and heterogeneity on the
   landscape. The habitat requirements for Alder Flycatcher,
   Black-and-white Warbler, Bay-breasted Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler,
   Brown Creeper, Common Yellowthroat, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Least
   Flycatcher, Ovenbird, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Red-eyed Vireo, Winter
   Wren, and White-throated Sparrow describe a broad range of habitat
   conditions that, at a minimum, describe necessary coarse-filter
   conditions to sustain the boreal songbird community in Ontario. This
   suite of species can also serve in developing a ``bioassay{''} to
   evaluate the effectiveness of forest policy to conserve biodiversity
   through emulation of natural disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in mature forest cover amount, composition, and configuration
   can be of significant consequence to wildlife populations. The response
   of wildlife to forest patterns is of concern to forest managers because
   it lies at the heart of such competing approaches to forest planning as
   aggregated vs. dispersed harvest block layouts. In this study, we
   developed a species assessment framework to evaluate the outcomes of
   forest management scenarios on biodiversity conservation objectives.
   Scenarios were assessed in the context of a broad range of forest
   structures and patterns that would be expected to occur under natural
   disturbance and succession processes. Spatial habitat models were used
   to predict the effects of varying degrees of mature forest cover amount,
   composition, and configuration on habitat occupancy for a set of 13
   focal songbird species. We used a spatially explicit harvest scheduling
   program to model forest management options and simulate future forest
   conditions resulting from alternative forest management scenarios, and
   used a process-based fire-simulation model to simulate future forest
   conditions resulting from natural wildfire disturbance. Spatial pattern
   signatures were derived for both habitat occupancy and forest
   conditions, and these were placed in the context of the simulated range
   of natural variation. Strategic policy analyses were set in the context
   of current Ontario forest management policies. This included use of
   sequential time-restricted harvest blocks (created for Woodland caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus) conservation) and delayed harvest areas (created for
   American marten (Martes americana atrata) conservation). This approach
   increased the realism of the analysis, but reduced the generality of
   interpretations. We found that forest management options that create
   linear strips of old forest deviate the most from simulated natural
   patterns, and had the greatest negative effects on habitat occupancy,
   whereas policy options that specify deferment and timing of harvest for
   large blocks helped ensure the stable presence of an intact mature
   forest matrix over time. The management scenario that focused on
   maintaining compositional targets best supported biodiversity objectives
   by providing the composition patterns required by the 13 focal species,
   but this scenario may be improved by adding some broad-scale spatial
   objectives to better maintain large blocks of interior forest habitat
   through time.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding seabirds are threatened by human activities that affect nesting
   and foraging habitat. In Canada, one of the seabirds most at risk of
   extirpation is the Roseate Tern, Sterna dougallii. Although critical
   nesting habitat has been identified for the Roseate Tern in Canada, its
   foraging locations and the diet of its chicks are unknown. Therefore,
   our goal was to determine the foraging locations and diet of chicks of
   Roseate Tern breeding on Country Island, Nova Scotia, which is one of
   Canada's two main breeding colonies. In 2003 and 2004, we radio-tracked
   the Roseate Tern by plane to locate foraging areas and conducted feeding
   watches to determine the diet of chicks. Roseate Tern foraged
   approximately 7 km from the breeding colony over shallow water < 5 m
   deep. In both years, sand lance, Ammodytes spp., was the most common
   prey item delivered to chicks, followed by hake, Urophycis spp. Our
   results are consistent with previous work at colonies in the
   northeastern United States, suggesting that throughout its range, this
   species may be restricted in both habitat use and prey selection. The
   reliance on a specific habitat type and narrow range of prey species
   makes the Roseate Tern generally susceptible to habitat perturbations
   and reductions in the availability of prey.}},

Title = {{Population Assessment of an Endangered Shorebird: the Piping Plover
   (Charadrius melodus melodus) in Eastern Canada}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Small, at-risk populations are those for which accurate demographic
   information is most crucial to conservation and recovery, but also where
   data collection is constrained by logistical challenges and small sample
   sizes. Migratory animals in particular may experience a wide range of
   threats to survival and reproduction throughout each annual cycle, and
   identification of life stages most critical to persistence may be
   especially difficult for these populations. The endangered eastern
   Canadian breeding population of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus
   melodus) was estimated at only 444 adults in 2005, and extensive effort
   has been invested in conservation activities, reproductive monitoring,
   and marking of individual birds, providing a comprehensive data set on
   population dynamics since 1998. We used these data to build a matrix
   projection model for two Piping Plover population segments that nest in
   eastern Canada in order to estimate both deterministic and stochastic
   rates of population growth (lambda(d) and lambda(s), respectively).
   Annual population censuses suggested moderate growth in abundance
   between 1998-2003, but vital rate estimates indicated that this
   temporary growth may be replaced by declines in the long term, both in
   southern Nova Scotia (lambda(d) = 1.0043, lambda(s) = 0.9263) and in the
   Gulf of St. Lawrence (lambda(d) = 0.9651, lambda(s) = 0.8214).
   Nonetheless, confidence intervals on lambda estimates were relatively
   wide, highlighting remaining uncertainty in future population
   trajectories. Differences in projected growth between regions appear to
   be driven by low estimated juvenile post-fledging survival in the Gulf,
   but threats to juveniles of both population segments following departure
   from nesting beaches remain unidentified. Similarly, lambda in both
   population segments was particularly sensitive to changes in adult
   survival as expected for most migratory birds, but very little is
   understood about the threats to Piping Plover survival during migration
   and overwintering. Consequently, we suggest that future recovery efforts
   for these and other vulnerable migrants should quantify and manage the
   largely unknown sources of both adult and juvenile mortality during
   non-breeding seasons while maintaining current levels of nesting habitat
   protection.}},

Abstract = {{The Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) disappeared from
   the forests of southeastern North America in the early 20th Century and
   for more than 50 years has been widely considered extinct. On 21 May
   2005, we detected a bird that we identified as an Ivory-billed
   Woodpecker in the mature swamp forest along the Choctawhatchee River in
   the panhandle of Florida. During a subsequent year of research, members
   of our small search team observed birds that we identified as
   Ivory-billed Woodpeckers on 14 occasions. We heard sounds that matched
   descriptions of Ivory-billed Woodpecker acoustic signals on 41
   occasions. We recorded 99 putative double knocks and 210 putative kent
   calls. We located cavities in the size range reported for Ivory-billed
   Woodpeckers and larger than those of Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus
   pileatus) that have been reported in the literature or that we measured
   in Alabama. We documented unique foraging signs consistent with the
   feeding behavior of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. Our evidence suggests that
   Ivory-billed Woodpeckers may be present in the forests along the
   Choctawhatchee River and warrants an expanded search of this bottomland
   forest habitat.}},

   Data?}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Populations of Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) have declined markedly in
   North America since the early 1980s. When considering alternatives for
   achieving population recovery, it would be useful to understand how the
   rate of population growth is functionally related to the underlying
   vital rates and which vital rates affect population growth rate the most
   if changed (which need not be those that influenced historical
   population declines). To establish a more quantitative basis for
   learning about life history and population dynamics of Lesser Scaup, we
   summarized published and unpublished estimates of vital rates recorded
   between 1934 and 2005, and developed matrix life-cycle models with these
   data for females breeding in the boreal forest, prairie-parklands, and
   both regions combined. We then used perturbation analysis to evaluate
   the effect of changes in a variety of vital-rate statistics on finite
   population growth rate and abundance. Similar to Greater Scaup (Aythya
   marila), our modeled population growth rate for Lesser Scaup was most
   sensitive to unit and proportional change in adult female survival
   during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, but much less so to
   changes in fecundity parameters. Interestingly, population growth rate
   was also highly sensitive to unit and proportional changes in the mean
   of nesting success, duckling survival, and juvenile survival. Given the
   small samples of data for key aspects of the Lesser Scaup life cycle, we
   recommend additional research on vital rates that demonstrate a strong
   effect on population growth and size (e.g., adult survival
   probabilities). Our life-cycle models should be tested and regularly
   updated in the future to simultaneously guide science and management of
   Lesser Scaup populations in an adaptive context.}},

   in North America. Hence, we radio-tagged Barred Owls in boreal mixedwood
   in Alberta to determine whether harvesting influenced habitat selection.
   We used three spatial scales: nest sites, i.e., nest tree and adjacent
   area of 11.7 m radius around nests, nesting territory of 1000 m radius
   around nests, and home range locations within 2000 m radius of the home
   range center. Barred Owls nested primarily in balsam poplar (Populus
   balsamifera) snags > 34 cm dbh and nest trees were surrounded by large,
   > 34 cm dbh, balsam poplar trees and snags. Nesting territories
   contained a variety of habitats including young < 80-yr-old,
   deciduous-dominated stands, old deciduous and coniferous-dominated
   stands, treed bogs, and recent clear-cuts. However, when compared to
   available habitat in the study area, they were more likely to contain
   old conifer-dominated stands and recent cutblocks. We assumed this is
   because all of the recent harvest occurred in old stands, habitat
   preferred by the owls. When compared with random sites, locations used
   for foraging and roosting at the home range scale were more likely to be
   in young deciduous-dominated stands, old conifer-dominated stands and
   cutblocks > 30 yr old, and less likely to occur in old
   deciduous-dominated stands and recent cutblocks. Hence, although recent
   clearcuts occurred in territories, birds avoided these microhabitats
   during foraging. To meet the breeding requirements of Barred Owls in
   managed forests, 10-20 ha patches of old deciduous and mixedwood forest
   containing large Populus snags or trees should be maintained. In our
   study area, nest trees had a minimum dbh of 34 cm. Although cut areas
   were incorporated into home ranges, the amount logged was low, i.e.,
   7\%, in our area. Hence more research is required to determine harvest
   levels tolerated by owls over the long term.}},

   Multiscale Assessment}},

Abstract = {{We examined nest site selection by Puerto Rican Parrots, a secondary
   cavity nester, at several spatial scales using the nest entrance as the
   central focal point relative to 20 habitat and spatial variables. The
   Puerto Rican Parrot is unique in that, since 2001, all known nesting in
   the wild has occurred in artificial cavities, which also provided us
   with an opportunity to evaluate nest site selection without confounding
   effects of the actual nest cavity characteristics. Because of the data
   limitations imposed by the small population size of this critically
   endangered endemic species, we employed a distribution-free statistical
   simulation approach to assess site selection relative to characteristics
   of used and unused nesting sites. Nest sites selected by Puerto Rican
   Parrots were characterized by greater horizontal and vertical visibility
   from the nest entrance, greater density of mature sierra palms, and a
   more westerly and leeward orientation of nest entrances than unused
   sites. Our results suggest that nest site selection in this species is
   an adaptive response to predation pressure, to which the parrots respond
   by selecting nest sites offering advantages in predator detection and
   avoidance at all stages of the nesting cycle. We conclude that
   identifying and replicating the ``nest gestalt{''} of successful nesting
   sites may facilitate conservation efforts for this and other endangered
   avian species.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat area requirements of forest songbirds vary greatly among
   species, but the causes of this variation are not well understood. Large
   area requirements could result from advantages for certain species when
   settling their territories near those of conspecifics. This phenomenon
   would result in spatial aggregations much larger than single
   territories. Species that aggregate their territories could show reduced
   population viability in highly fragmented forests, since remnant patches
   may remain unoccupied if they are too small to accommodate several
   territories. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to seek
   evidence of territory clusters of forest birds at various spatial
   scales, lags of 250-550 m, before and after controlling for habitat
   spatial patterns; and (2) to measure the relationship between spatial
   autocorrelation and apparent landscape sensitivity for these species. In
   analyses that ignored spatial variation of vegetation within remnant
   forest patches, nine of the 17 species studied significantly aggregated
   their territories within patches. After controlling for forest
   vegetation, the locations of eight out of 17 species remained
   significantly clustered. The aggregative pattern that we observed may,
   thus, be indicative of a widespread phenomenon in songbird populations.
   Furthermore, there was a tendency for species associated with higher
   forest cover to be more spatially aggregated {[}ERRATUM].}},

Abstract = {{I examined lists of endangered species from northeastern and midwestern
   United States to assess the extent to which they were dominated by
   species considered rare due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic
   stressors or, instead, by species whose rarity might be explained
   otherwise. Northeastern states had longer species lists than midwestern
   states, and more species associated with locally rare prairie habitats.
   More species at the edge of their geographic range appeared on lists
   from the Northeast than the Midwest. About 70\% of listed species
   overall have shown either no significant population trend, or increases,
   at the continental scale, but wetland and prairie species were
   frequently listed, consistent with the generally acknowledged,
   widespread loss of these habitats. Curiously, midwestern states tended
   to list fewer forest species, despite evidence that forest fragmentation
   there has had strongly deleterious effects on regional bird populations.
   Overall, species appear to be listed locally for a variety of reasons
   not necessarily related to their risk of extinction generally,
   potentially contributing to inefficient distributions of limited
   resources to deal effectively with species that legitimately require
   conservation attention. I advocate a continental perspective when
   listing species locally, and propose enhanced criteria for
   characterizing species as endangered at the local level.}},

Abstract = {{Stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) in flight feathers were measured to
   investigate the summer origins of five species of boreal-breeding
   warblers captured during fall migration at Canadian Migration Monitoring
   Network (CMMN) stations spread across southern Canada. Mean delta D
   varied among stations and species within stations, but there was broad
   overlap in delta D values. Although isotope ratios indicate that
   migrants at each station come from a wide range of latitudes, they are
   unable to provide much longitudinal discrimination. Band recoveries are
   sparse, but indicate that in general western Canadian warblers move
   southeast in fall, eastern birds move southwest, and there is a
   transition zone in the Great Lakes region. Combining knowledge of
   migratory direction with isotope results increases discrimination of
   breeding areas. Isotope results support fall migratory movements by
   Blackpoll Warbler (Dendroica striata) and Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus
   novaboracensis) that are more easterly than for other species, and in
   all study species, birds from more northern regions passed through
   southern Canada later in the season. Migration monitoring stations
   capture birds from broad areas of latitude, and migrants passing through
   each province appear to come from largely different portions of the
   Canadian breeding range, so a few stations placed in each province
   should suffice collectively to sample birds from most of the boreal
   forest. Migration monitoring in southern Canada, therefore, has the
   potential to monitor status of boreal forest birds in Canada that are
   unsampled by other monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands in southern Alberta are often managed to benefit waterfowl and
   cattle production. Effects on other species usually are not examined. I
   determined the effect of managed wetlands on upland-nesting shorebirds
   in southern Alberta by comparing numbers of breeding willets
   (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and
   long-billed curlews (Numenius americanus) among areas of managed
   wetlands, natural wetland basins, and no wetland basins from 1995 to
   2000. Surveys were carried out at 21 sites three times each year. Nine
   to ten of these areas (each 2 km(2)) were searched for nests annually
   from 1998-2000. Numbers of willets and marbled godwits and their nests
   were always highest in areas with managed wetlands, probably because
   almost all natural wetland basins were dry in this region in most years.
   Densities of willets seen during pre-incubation surveys averaged 2.3
   birds/km(2) in areas of managed wetlands, 0.4 in areas of natural
   wetland basins, and 0.1 in areas with no wetland basins. Nest densities
   of willets (one search each season) averaged 1.5, 0.9, and 0.3
   nests/km(2) in areas of managed, natural, and no wetland basins,
   respectively. Similarly, pre-incubation surveys averaged 1.6, 0.6, and
   0.2 godwits/km(2) in areas of managed, natural, and no wetland basins,
   and 1.2, 0.3, and 0.1 godwit nests/km(2). For long-billed curlews,
   pre-incubation surveys averaged 0.1, 0.2, and 0.1 birds/km(2), and 0,
   0.2, and 0 nests/km(2). Nest success was similar in areas with and
   without managed wetlands. Shallow managed wetlands in this region appear
   beneficial to willets and marbled godwits, but not necessarily to
   long-billed curlews. Only 8\% of marked willets and godwits with nests
   in the area were seen or heard during surveys, compared with 29\% of
   pre-laying individuals and 42\% of birds with broods. This suggests that
   a low and variable percentage of these birds is counted during breeding
   bird surveys, likely limiting their ability to adequately monitor
   populations of these species.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting structures for ground-nesting waterfowl may be an effective
   technique for increasing nesting success in regions in which nest
   success is below the 15\% threshold needed to maintain a stable
   population. We studied the occupancy rate of artificial nesting
   structures called hen houses (TM) by Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)
   nesting in two different wetland habitats, beaver ponds and sewage
   lagoons, in eastern Ontario during 1999-2001. We hypothesized that,
   because natural cover was sparse on sewage lagoons, Mallards would
   occupy hen houses at a higher rate on sewage lagoons than on beaver
   ponds. However, of the 248 hen houses distributed between beaver ponds
   and sewage lagoons, none was occupied by waterfowl. Common Grackles
   (Quiscalus quiscula) were the only avian species that nested in hen
   houses. However, Mallards successfully nested directly under several
   structures (n = 6) when water levels were low enough to expose the
   ground beneath them. Mayfield daily nest survival estimates for Mallards
   nesting in natural cover were similar on sewage lagoons and beaver ponds
   for all years (mean = 0.99) and were higher than most published
   estimates. Factors such as nesting cover, predation pressures, and
   structure design and material may influence the use of artificial hen
   houses and should be considered when planning a hen house program
   outside of the Prairie Pothole Region.}},

Abstract = {{Waved albatrosses often relocate their eggs during incubation by placing
   the egg between the tarsi and shuffling forward. This behavior
   frequently results in eggs becoming lodged between rocks, accounting for
   at least 10\%, and perhaps as much as 80\%, of breeding failures.
   Because albatross populations worldwide are currently threatened,
   artificial means of augmenting reproductive success may be necessary to
   mitigate losses caused by anthropogenic effects. We characterize the
   frequency and extent of egg movement; test several hypotheses related to
   microhabitat, timing, and incubation location to explain the behavior;
   and investigate the utility of repositioning lodged eggs in a location
   in which breeding birds might resume incubation. Egg rescue increased
   both the likelihood of continued incubation as well as the hatching rate
   in our experiment, and provides an efficient, low-cost management option
   for this species.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the timing of breeding and juvenile/adult ratios among
   songbirds in temperate rain forests over four years on the Haida Gwaii
   (Queen Charlotte Islands) archipelago, British Columbia. In May 1998,
   air temperatures in Haida Gwaii were above average, whereas in 1999 they
   were the lowest in 20 yr: temperatures in the other two years were
   closer to normal, although 2001 was almost as cold as 1999. Temperatures
   closely followed the patterns of sea surface temperatures created by the
   1997-1998 El Nino, i.e., warm, event and the subsequent strong La Nina,
   i.e., cool, event. Timing of breeding, as measured by the first capture
   of juveniles or by direct observations of hatching, varied by
   approximately 19 d between the earliest (1998) and latest (1999) years.
   In 1998, the proportion of juveniles among birds trapped increased
   steeply as soon as young birds began to appear. In other years, the rate
   of increase was slower. In 1999, the peak proportions of hatching-year
   individuals among the foliage-gleaning insectivores, i.e., the
   Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata), Townsend's Warbler (Dendroica
   townsendi), and the Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), were lower
   than in other years, with almost no young Orange-crowned Warblers
   captured at all. The pattern of variation in the timing of breeding and
   in the proportion of hatching-year individuals trapped fitted the
   temperature data well, although rainfall may also have contributed. We
   concluded that changes mediated by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   in sea surface temperatures off northern British Columbia, through their
   effects on air temperatures, had a strong effect on the breeding of
   forest birds, to the point of causing nearly complete reproductive
   failure for one species in 1999. An intensification of the ENSO cycle
   could lead to more erratic reproduction for some species.}},

Title = {{Stable Isotope Analysis Reveals That Agricultural Habitat Provides an
   Important Dietary Component for Nonbreeding Dunlin}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although shorebirds spending the winter in temperate areas frequently
   use estuarine and supratidal (upland) feeding habitats, the relative
   contribution of each habitat to individual diets has not been directly
   quantified. We quantified the proportional use that Calidris alpina
   pacifica (Dunlin) made of estuarine vs. terrestrial farmland resources
   on the Fraser River Delta, British Columbia, using stable isotope
   analysis (delta 13C, delta 15N) of blood from 268 Dunlin over four
   winters, 1997 through 2000. We tested for individual, age, sex,
   morphological, seasonal, and weather-related differences in dietary
   sources. Based on single-(delta 13C) and dual-isotope mixing models, the
   agricultural habitat contributed approximately 38\% of Dunlin diet
   averaged over four winters, with the balance from intertidal flats.
   However, there was a wide variation among individuals in the extent of
   agricultural feeding, ranging from about 1\% to 95\% of diet. Younger
   birds had a significantly higher terrestrial contribution to diet (43\%)
   than did adults (35\%). We estimated that 6\% of adults and 13\% of
   juveniles were obtaining at least 75\% of their diet from terrestrial
   sources. The isotope data provided no evidence for sex or overall body
   size effects on the proportion of diet that is terrestrial in origin.
   The use of agricultural habitat by Dunlin peaked in early January. Adult
   Dunlin obtained a greater proportion of their diet terrestrially during
   periods of lower temperatures and high precipitation, whereas no such
   relationship existed for juveniles. Seasonal variation in the use of
   agricultural habitat suggests that it is used more during energetically
   stressful periods. The terrestrial farmland zone appears to be
   consistently important as a habitat for juveniles, but for adults it may
   provide an alternative feeding site used as a buffer against starvation
   during periods of extreme weather. Loss or reduction of agricultural
   habitat adjacent to estuaries may negatively impact shorebird fitness,
   with juveniles disproportionately affected.}},

Title = {{Scale and Sensitivity of Songbird Occurrence to Landscape Structure in a
   Harvested Boreal Forest}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To explore the spatial scales at which boreal forest birds respond to
   landscape structure and how those responses are influenced by forest
   harvest, we quantified the relationship between amounts of forest in the
   landscape at multiple spatial scales and the occurrence of 11 common
   boreal songbirds in western Newfoundland. The habitat type was assessed
   at a local scale (25 m diameter area) and amounts of forest habitat were
   measured at neighborhood (300 m) and landscape (2500 m) scales. We
   further compared how these relationships differed, depending on whether
   the landscape had been harvested or not, i.e., the landscape context.
   Landscape-scale metrics were related to occurrence for 7 of 11 species.
   For five of these seven, landscape context was also important. Landscape
   context was not important in models that did not contain a
   landscape-scale term. In four of five of the models including landscape
   context, there was an interaction of the term with either landscape or
   neighborhood effects, indicating that, not only was there an effect of
   forest harvest at the broad scale, but that effect altered the response
   of the species to other metrics. For the majority of species, overall
   occurrence tended to be higher in natural than in harvested landscapes,
   especially at higher levels of forest cover. Interestingly, for some
   species, occurrence was relatively similar across levels of forest cover
   within harvested, but not natural, landscapes. The results suggest some
   scale-invariance in species' responses to landscape structure, and that
   some species respond to landscape structure at scales that are broader
   than those implied by our current knowledge of territorial or dispersal
   distances. Collectively, the results also suggest that forest management
   needs to consider not only how local-scale processes might be influenced
   by local-scale changes in amounts of forest, but also how the broader
   scale context might interact with those local-scale changes to produce
   counter-intuitive results. The complex nature of some of the
   relationships we observed suggests that generalized management policy
   for forests and songbirds will be elusive.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Ivory-billed Woodpecker has long held a special place in the psyche
   of North American conservation, eliciting unusually colorful prose, even
   from scientists, as an icon of the wild. The reverence in which it was
   held did little to slow the habitat loss that led to its apparent
   extinction 60 years ago. A consequence of the emotion and attention
   associated with the amazing rediscovery of this species is that
   conservation biologists will be under considerable pressure to make good
   on this ``second chance.{''} This poses a challenge to conservation
   paradigms that has important political consequences. First, the decline
   of the species is due to habitat loss, recovery from which has been much
   more seldom achieved than recovery from declines due to impacts on vital
   rates. This challenge is exacerbated by the enormous area requirements
   of the species. Second, the species at best exists as a critically small
   population. It will be difficult to make the case that a viable
   population can be established without undermining the small population
   paradigm that underlies conservation strategies for many other species.
   This has already resulted in some political backlash. Conservation of
   this species is best based on the one point of clear scientific
   consensus, that habitat is limiting, but this may result in additional
   political backlash because of conflicts with other land uses.}},
